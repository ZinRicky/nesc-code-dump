00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Mom's cabinet picks got you down? Good,

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:06.701
you're alive. Here are five ways to turn that anger into action.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.540
Become the biggest, inseparable bitch the world has ever seen.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.480
Here's how to scare an autograph.

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.501
Step number one be the bitch that calls out lies.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.560
Autographs literally thrive on money and reality.

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:21.001
They're counting on you to play nice. Don't.

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.741
When someone parrots misinformation or conspiracy theories,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.680
don't let it slide.

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:27.801
Be the bitch that shuts it down and say that's not true

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:30.981
or that's propaganda. Truth telling isn't rude,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.880
it's revolutionary and it's cute.

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:40.101
Number two bitches build systems that autocorrects can't touch.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.220
Don't touch me. When government systems break down, you build your own

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.840
on anything that's underground,

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:51.161
because that's where the other bitches are.

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:53.401
Three, bitches win wars,

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:54.861
not pointless arguments.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.280
Not every conversation is going to be worth your energy,

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.181
so you gotta be a bitch, but you gotta be a tactical bitch.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.920
No.4 know your history.

00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:04.321
Whenever an autocracy has failed,

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:06.361
it was a defiant bitches that made it happen.

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:09.041
Case in point when Trump tried to pass his Muslim ban

00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:10.441
and we flooded airports. Which,

00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:11.921
by the way, was Steven Miller's idea,

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:13.501
who's now in Trump's cabinet.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.040
That we are going to defy.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.761
Lastly, rest like a rebel.

00:01:16.762 --> 00:01:18.261
That means recharging your body.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.560
Just taking care of yourself

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.661
is a middle finger to the system that wants to render you powerless.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.000
More ways to be an insufferable bitch.

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.761
Comment and I'll make a Part two.

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:30.073
There's a way here. Cool.
