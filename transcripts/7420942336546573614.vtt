00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.600
So if you're not following Jessica Valenci and abortion everyday

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:05.321
here on TikTok and Instagram,

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:07.441
you definitely should be. Yesterday

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:10.081
I Learned from the Abortion Everyday Instagram page

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:12.841
about the Georgia abortion ban being repealed.

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:16.701
A Georgia judge has struck down the state's six week abortion ban,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.560
and Judge Robert Mcberney's comments on the ruling

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:22.461
were what really stood out to me.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.620
Specifically this quote that was pulled on the abortion everyday page

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.040
it is not for a legislator,

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:30.121
a judge, or commander from The Handmaid's Tale

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:32.061
to tell these women what to do with their bodies

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.160
during this period when the fetus cannot survive outside the womb

00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.981
anymore so than society could or should

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.560
force them to serve as a human tissue bank

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.581
or to give up a kidney for the benefit of another.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.880
And these last few lines in particular, comparing, um,

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:51.621
forcing women to carry a fetus to term with forced organ donation

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.920
is something that reminded me of a piece

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.841
that I read in an ethics class,

00:00:56.842 --> 00:01:00.161
a piece by Judith Jarvis Thompson called A Defensive Abortion

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:01.321
that I read in, like,

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:04.301
Ethics 1:01 when I was a freshman in 2016.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.640
This piece essentially grants,

00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:08.681
for the sake of argument, that the fetus has a right to life,

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:11.881
but Thompson uses thought experiments to argue that the right to life

00:01:11.882 --> 00:01:13.201
does not include, entail,

00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:17.221
or imply the right to use someone else's body to survive,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.480
and that induced abortion is therefore morally permissible.

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:23.541
A little clip From the Wikipedia page about the article.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.520
You wake up in the morning

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:27.521
and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist.

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.621
A famous unconscious violinist.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.520
He's been found to have a fatal kidney ailment.

00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:32.921
And the society of Music Lovers

00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:35.201
has canvassed all the available medical records

00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:38.281
and found that you alone have the right blood type to help.

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:39.881
They have therefore kidnapped you.

00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:43.241
And last night, the violinist circulatory system was plugged into yours

00:01:43.242 --> 00:01:46.521
so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:49.401
as well as your own. If he has unplugged from you now,

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:51.561
he will die, but in nine months,

00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:53.321
he will have recovered from his ailment

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:55.401
and can be safely unplugged from you.

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:59.001
And obviously, most pro abortion people are of the opinion

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:00.881
that if a person wants an abortion,

00:02:00.882 --> 00:02:02.121
they should be able to get one,

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.321
no questions asked.

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:06.201
But if you want or need to get philosophical with it,

00:02:06.202 --> 00:02:09.561
for someone who is kind of challenged by the,

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.921
I don't know, moral justification of abortion,

00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:14.281
we can talk about why we expect women

00:02:14.282 --> 00:02:18.021
to be willing to carry a fetus to term for 40 weeks.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.540
We wouldn't expect a person to be kidnapped

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.974
and hooked up to another person for nine months to keep them alive.
