00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.640
So actually, Brennie Brown,

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:03.201
she is a researcher at.

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:05.041
For the university of Texas or something,

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:06.121
but she, um,

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:09.981
she has one of the most famous TED talks on YouTube about empathy.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.640
Um, she says, empathy is a muscle,

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:15.001
and we just have to use it just like any other muscle.

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.061
Like you would lift weights and become strong.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.600
Empathy is just a muscle that we have to use.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.081
So I don't think it's that

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:23.401
men are limited in their capacity to empathize.

00:00:23.402 --> 00:00:27.101
I think men are limited in their requirement.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.920
What is asked of them to empathize.

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:31.241
We give them so many passes by saying, oh,

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:32.121
he's a man, he's a man,

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:35.201
but he's a human, just like we're human,

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.721
and they shouldn't be getting any passes for anything. And.

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:39.961
And just like any other muscle,

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:40.761
if you don't use it,

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:47.521
you lose it. So I think when men or boys are raised to ignore emotion

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:48.361
or to not feel

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:50.301
or whatever weird things,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.100
you know, men have to go through,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.260
I think that's what causes them to grow up emotionally immature.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.080
But they should absolutely still be required to

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:01.821
go through life in the same

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.560
requirements as other people.

00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:05.581
They should. They should still be able to empathize.
