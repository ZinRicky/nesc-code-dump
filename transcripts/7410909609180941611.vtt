00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540
Would you date a conservative?

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.000
No. No, no, no.

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:07.641
Why not? Yeah,

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.041
cause I don't hate myself.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.141
Oh, my god.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.260
Like that. I think he's like.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.360
I mean, I don't think he's a conservative,

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:23.781
but like, that was.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.980
That's the rule. I'm a big on my values and morals,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.400
and conservatives

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:33.641
values and morals typically don't align with that of mine.

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:36.321
I really value the people that I date

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:38.241
and I want them to value me the same way.

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:40.961
And I think that politics is very personal

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:44.201
and for me, I really have a hard time separating the two.

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:46.441
For me to really love someone and for me to feel like I love them,

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:48.561
I feel like we have to rely on certain things,

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:50.941
for certain morals for our relationship to work.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.640
That's a hard line for me.

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:53.801
I just couldn't marry someone

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:57.281
that would consciously vote against everything that I stand for

00:00:57.282 --> 00:01:00.764
and my existence. That's a hard no, no.
