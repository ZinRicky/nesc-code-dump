00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.440
Here's the thing I love about that fucking CNN article.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.120
Imagine not liking me

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.220
and then seeing my face on fucking CNN.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.560
I just love that for them.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.760
I love that for them,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.740
for all the people who were for me to fail.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.860
How does it feel to see me in CNN though?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.100
How does that feel?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.260
Cause it feels good as fuck for me.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.760
And I know, like,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.560
you know, that's pretty valid.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
It's a pretty valid fucking news source to be like, wow,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.860
she's got a story,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.220
you know what I mean?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.060
Imagine not liking me right now,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.340
because it's fucking great being me right now.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.860
That's fucking great.
