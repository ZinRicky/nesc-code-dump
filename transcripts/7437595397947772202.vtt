00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.780
Silver Dollar City crossover

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.920
and that is what's happening today

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.000

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.460
so I guess that's a lifetime wait paid off

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.280
good for you Jen

00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:31.100

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.700
aka Manly his first Silver Dollar City experience

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.300
so here we go everybody

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.540

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.840
see the massive tree for the first time

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:48.560
so this is about to be a really cool moment

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:52.540
so let's see what the thoughts are on this huge tree

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.360
oh yes the massive Christmas tree

00:00:56.361 --> 00:01:00.400
the lights at five we have to see that cause I love Christmas trees

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:03.820
the gates have opened and we're headed to Time Traveller

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.100
to give Dean his first experience of Time Traveller

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.300
Time Traveler yeah

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.020
hopefully you don't get sick

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.180
the front row seat of Time Traveler

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.380
it spins while it goes forward

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.320
yeah I'm definitely warmer than I was when I got on

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.160
now we're headed to powder keg

00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:33.840
okay we're gonna try to get all of these rides in before it gets dark

00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:35.640
while the park is just newly open

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:38.140
so we don't have to wait in super long lines okay

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.980
this is me after powder keg

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.640
should we do the barn swing and just swing up and down

00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:53.220
there's a little more G force

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.200
but there's no does it

00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:56.860
does it invert no

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.880
I looked over he was crying on Powder keg

00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:01.140
and then I said no

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.080
my eyes were watering yeah yeah yeah

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:09.360
his eyes were watering Dean watched how the giant barn swing works

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:13.020
and he's decided that he's willing to ride it with us

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.420
so we are embarking on riding the giant barn swing

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.500
and we'll see how this goes

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.900
this is what I look like after the barn door

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.300
oh my god

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.360
we just got done with the Christmas Carol

00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:40.560
and it was great and now it's dark outside

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:44.680
and Dean's about to experience the magic of Silver Dollar City

00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:46.520
Silver Dollar City at night

00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:48.880
it looks beautiful as we exit the theater 

00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:51.960
we're headed to go get some apple dumplings

00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.300
Dean has his salted caramel

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.940
yes salted caramel

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.380
vanilla swirl

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.660
very tasty

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.880
but he's looking for one of those massive mountain chocolate chip cookies

00:03:04.881 --> 00:03:07.020
because we know that that's his favorite

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.600
so that's coming up around the corner

00:03:09.601 --> 00:03:13.100
and I'm sure he'll be very happy at the end of all of this

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.760
and maybe even take a gift home for Katherine

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:19.100
which will be perfect so do you need a Coke

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.220
some kind of Coke ornament

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.120
it would be nice if they had a Diet Coke one

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:27.380
because that would be more your style yeah

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.980
somehow

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.980
goodbye bye
