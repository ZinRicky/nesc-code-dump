00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
Let's can some pumpkin puree.

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:04.121
I'm using sugar pie pumpkins that I grew in my garden.

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:05.961
I highly recommend getting sugar pie pumpkins.

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:07.361
Don't use Jack o lantern pumpkins.

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:10.281
The taste is just not the same cause these have a higher sugar content.

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:13.361
Now this is technically not USDA recommended.

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:15.321
Do rebel can here. So if that's not your thing,

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:16.601
that's fine. Just don't do this.

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.361
You're gonna start by cutting the pumpkins in half

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:19.581
and scooping out the seeds.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.760
I'm just gonna pop these in the oven at 400 for about 45 to an hour.

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.401
Just depends on the temperature of your oven

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:26.681
and how fast it gets things done.

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:28.761
Once they're done, they're gonna be nice and soft.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.401
Should be able to stick a knife through them.

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:31.921
Peel off the skins. It's a bit tedious.

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:33.201
You might have to use your fingers.

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:35.321
Add the cooked pumpkin to a pot or a bowl.

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:36.841
And I just use my immersion blender

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.821
till you get it to this nice puree consistency.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.840
Lateral into jars

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.401
and I do smack it around a little bit to get it to settle more.

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:44.001
We're gonna have 1 inch head space.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.361
Wipe your rims with vinegar using my 4 jars.

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.561
Lids for these bands go on finger tight

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:49.841
and then I just set up my canner.

00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:52.561
I do put vinegar in my canner to help with mineral deposits.

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:54.081
Since this only made two pints,

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:56.601
I also added in some black beans.

00:00:56.602 --> 00:01:00.001
Process for 75 minutes. Be Careful to open your canner,

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.581
because I did get myself a nice steam burn.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.080
So then I let them sit a little bit,

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:05.441
and I pull them out of the canner

00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:07.001
and then let them sit for 24 hours.

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.243
And then I will take the bands off and then you are done.
