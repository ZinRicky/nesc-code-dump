00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.160
Ever wondered how to make heavy cream?

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:03.041
Here's how I do it.

00:00:03.042 --> 00:00:05.481
I start off with some raw milk.

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:07.721
This is full fat raw milk straight from the cow.

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:11.421
I just filtered this milk for a milk screen and put it in the fridge.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.560
By the next day,

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:14.321
the heavy cream has all risen to the top

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:15.601
and it's separated from the milk

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:16.861
and I could just scoop it out.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.840
There are several ways to remove the heavy cream from the top of

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:21.761
the milk. You can scoop it out like this.

00:00:21.762 --> 00:00:23.421
This is my favourite way to do it.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.140
You could use a Turkey baster to suck the milk on the off the top,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.600
or you could use,

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:30.921
like, one of those big glass milk dispensers

00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:32.281
with a little tap on the bottom

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:35.601
and you could slowly let the milk drain from the bottom

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.581
and then you're just left with heavy cream.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.240
So I'm trying to scoop just the cream,

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:42.861
but sometimes I'm gonna scoop a little bit of the milk.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.400
Um, you have the heavy, thick cream on top and then you have just, like,

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:48.281
what I would say, like double triple cream,

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:49.001
and then you have, like,

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:51.321
single cream on the bottom of that,

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:54.261
and then you have milk under that, which is still full fat milk.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.000
So once you let all those different types of cream

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:58.881
sit in the refrigerator overnight

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:00.541
again in another jar,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.960
the heaviest cream will then rise the top

00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:04.661
and there you Have your heavy cream
