00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.680
Okay, the timer went off.

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:03.641
It's been 30 minutes.

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:05.861
We're gonna see how this is helped.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.260
Looks glamorous

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.160
with a little stronger. Okay.

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:17.761
I got one of these from the TikTok shop.

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:19.621
My face does get kind of puffy.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.300
You can see, like,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.820
you know.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.980
Okay, I just wanted to see.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.440
So it's got these two carbon negative ions,

00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:32.041
which can better reduce swelling,

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:35.281
tighten the chin neck, and restore elasticity.

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:37.381
So you line your chin up with this

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.780
here through it.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.380
Okay. And then you strap these.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.240
It says

00:00:56.241 --> 00:01:00.581
recommended use three to five times a week for 20 to 35 minutes.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.860
Hmm.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.060
It for sure.
