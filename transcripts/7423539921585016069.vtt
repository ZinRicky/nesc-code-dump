00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.980
Today, as minister of families and on behalf of the people of Manitoba,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.100
let me express our deepest sorrow and regret to every Manitoba child.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.420
Denied the children's special allowance.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.040
For 14 years, Manitoba required child and family services

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:33.941
agencies to return over $335 million in federal CSA payments,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.500
funds meant to support your well being,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.500
education and opportunities to thrive.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.980
This was not just a financial mistake.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.600
It was a profound injustice,

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:50.781
leaving some of our most vulnerable children

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.420
without the supports they needed

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.660
and rightfully deserved. These funds should have nourished your dreams,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.780
helped you learn, grow and flourish.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.940
We recognize the pain,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.740
loss and harm caused by past government practices,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.460
taking away that which was rightfully yours.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.460
We are sorry.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.460
Our government has taken a long overdue step in correcting this wrong.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.920
We have agreed to a settlement of $530 million

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.941
to compensate those who were denied these funds.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.500
This settlement is not just about writing the past.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.260
It's about paving the way forward.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.300
It's about restoring dignity,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.220
healing wounds

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.900
and building a better future for the children of Manitoba.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.600
To the children, young adults and families affected,

00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:55.821
I say this, your courage,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.260
your resilience,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.060
your determination to stand up and demand fairness has been heard.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.740
You are not just survivors.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.180
You are warriors of justice.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.960
You have been at the forefront of showing Manitobans

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:13.021
the path to reconciliation.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.140
Meguitch, for your unwavering strength,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.860
I stand before you not only as the minister responsible,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.300
but also as someone who Feels this profoundly on a personal level.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.520
I, like the minister of housing,

00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:31.221
addictions and homelessness,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.300
were once in children in care, too.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.660
We understand deeply

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.300
what it means to experience the child welfare system.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.460
And so today, we acknowledge the deep scars left by this deprivation,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.760
scars carried not just by you,

00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:52.941
but by families, friends and our communities.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.420
Today is only the beginning of this journey.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.000
Our government commits to continuing to learn from the past,

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.541
to listen and to act with integrity,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.760
ensuring every child now and in the future

00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:11.581
will grow up with the full support and love they deserve.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.620
I also want to share something deeply personal.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.820
I know healing is possible.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.780
I know despite the hurt, unfairness and despite the obstacles,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.820
there is a path of healing and a way forward.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.340
You have the right to thrive,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.460
to pursue education, to build careers,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.700
to dream freely, and to live a life full of joy and opportunity.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.560
Our greatest hope is you now have the space to not just survive,

00:03:45.561 --> 00:03:49.141
but to truly thrive. We see you.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.940
We see your beauty. We see your strength.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.720
We believe in your future.

00:03:53.721 --> 00:03:57.521
We believe in you. We are here to support your dreams

00:03:57.522 --> 00:04:01.681
and want nothing more than for you to live a full,

00:04:01.682 --> 00:04:05.301
joyful life that you so rightfully deserve.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.740
You are loved today and always.
