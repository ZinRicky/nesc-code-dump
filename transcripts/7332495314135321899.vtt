Good evening.

00:03.360 --> 00:06.200
Those may are making dinner.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.500
What are we making, Charlie?

00:07.840 --> 00:09.420
Uh, I don't know.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.160
No? Yeah. I didn't tell you.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.560
Chicken lentil soup.

00:12.560 --> 00:13.760
Chicken lentil soup.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.840
The Charles chopped all these vegetables,

00:15.840 --> 00:16.480
put them in.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.360
He's my helper.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.120
I'm doing dishes and telling him what to do.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.380
He's doing it for me.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.240
I'm gonna show you.

00:23.240 --> 00:28.960
So we have on the website our new French salts,

00:28.960 --> 00:31.260
black pepper and French salt blend,

00:32.160 --> 00:35.360
which is the most amazing blend ever.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.660
I use it for everything, literally.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.680
So this soup calls for salt and pepper,

00:42.680 --> 00:44.120
and we just ran out.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.220
I put them in my little canisters,

00:47.440 --> 00:49.260
so I'm opening another bag.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.620
Hello? I'm trying to.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.500
Daddy! Daddy! Pig!

01:20.280 --> 01:21.340
Ah, there.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.220
I love this salt and pepper blend.
