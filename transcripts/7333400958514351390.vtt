00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.360
I can't express how disabling ADHD is

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:04.761
my brain literally does not work right

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:07.161
I have been so like

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:10.481
depressed and rotting for weeks

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:11.601
my apartment has been a mess

00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:14.001
I've just been feeling like so shitty

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.401
first I had a friend visiting so I had to like clean the depression nest

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:19.741
and I took a Vyvanse today so that I can clean

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.060
not only is my apartment clean

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.200
but I'm also doing like that

00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:25.561
my bags my ADHD bag

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:26.681
like my several bags

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:29.721
like have things thrown in them for a different time to deal with

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:31.281
and you don't remember what's in there

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:32.081
cause like if you don't see

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:32.681
it doesn't exist

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:33.441
so then you just have like

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:34.641
several bags of things

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:37.761
I'm dealing with my ADHD bags just because

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:39.561
and it's just a sharp reminder that like

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:40.801
if my brain worked

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:42.561
I wouldn't be the way that I am

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:44.681
like I'm not just an inherently lazy person

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:46.431
like there is something wrong with me

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:48.041
 and a little fucking pill can fix it 

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:51.761
but I haven't been able to get my medication for 2 months

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:52.561
over 2 months

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:53.561
because of the vyvanse shortage 

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:54.801
so I'm just using the pills like

00:00:54.802 --> 00:00:55.401
when I need them

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:56.961
but I just can't imagine what my life would be like

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:59.071
if I could just operate like this all the time
