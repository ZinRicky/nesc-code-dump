00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
The gaps intro diet is basically an ancestral diet on steroids.

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:06.321
The pillars being tons of homemade bone broth,

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:08.321
tons of regenerative meat,

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:10.561
very few vegetables, only non starchy,

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:12.381
and tons of fermented foods.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.200
So, to put it plainly,

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.881
I'm eating a ton of soup. And when I say the cravings are real,

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.401
I mean the cravings are real.

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:20.881
I just want cake. Before you diagnose me with orthorexia,

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:23.381
the purpose behind me doing this diet

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.880
is to heal and seal my gut lining

00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:27.961
and repopulate my gut microbiome with beneficial microbes.

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:30.241
One way I'm doing that is by drinking liquid whey

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:33.841
that I made from kefir because it's packed full of probiotics.

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:36.761
And I'm trying to hit as many micronutrients as I possibly can

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.081
by remineralizing my water,

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:39.481
taking my organ supplements,

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:42.221
incorporating shilajit in my ginger gelatin gummies

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.180
that I've been eating between my meals.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.720
And let me tell you, after two weeks of eating this way,

00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:48.081
the biggest things that I noticed

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:51.361
are that my mood has improved significantly

00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:54.441
and that my brain is functioning so much better.

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:55.561
So I'm just gonna keep

00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:56.041
intuitively

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:58.805
eating this way until I feel like incorporating more foods.
