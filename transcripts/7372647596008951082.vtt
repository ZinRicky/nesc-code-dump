00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
I truly will never understand this mindset

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:04.681
that if you have a presence on social media

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:07.021
and you claim to be a traditional wife,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.360
how that is synonymous with not being allowed to make money online,

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:12.281
which, news flash,

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:14.801
I don't make all that much that you probably think I do.

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:16.801
I make probably under 100.

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:17.881
That's on a good month.

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:19.401
I know when one hears the word tried wife,

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:22.241
it immediately brings up images of the 1950s,

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:25.201
but that's not at all what trad wife movement

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:27.441
and the trad wife trend is about.

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:32.801
Women since the beginning of time have worked in either domestic labor,

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:35.161
work in the. In their own home,

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:36.841
sometimes even outside of their own homes.

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.521
That's not like a new thing.

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:40.961
This is why the 1950s was such an interesting time,

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:44.641
because it was the first time that leisure was such a thing

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:48.161
that women didn't really have to make everybody's clothes.

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:50.361
You know, grow your own food and preserve it

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.461
and make sure everyone's warm come the winter.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.400
It is a new era of leisure,

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:56.921
which is why we see that so many women were unhappy.

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:59.121
When you stop doing work in your lifetime,

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:01.961
then you're gonna start getting annoyed and going downhill

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:02.881
and just all these things.

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:05.741
We see that often when people retire and they just leave,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.960
live a life of leisure

00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.901
and not actually mentally stimulating themselves,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.720
physically stimulating themselves.

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:14.621
So, yes, I do make a very small,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.440
non substantial income.

00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:18.321
Sometimes from social media.

00:01:18.322 --> 00:01:19.961
Um, but this is a hobby to me.

00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:21.641
I don't treat it as a career.

00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:23.081
Cause this could all go away tomorrow,

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.219
and I'm still relying on my husband's income.
