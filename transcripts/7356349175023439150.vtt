00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.280
so on all my videos about being a cycle breaking parent or a respectful parent

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:09.241
there inevitably are comments from people who say well I don't know about you

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.761
but my kids are scared of me and they act right

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:15.361
or I got time out and I got beaten and I turned out just fine

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:17.221
so here's my parenting hot take

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.820
there are three general routes you can take with your style of parenting

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.640
the easiest is permissive parenting

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:26.001
you just ignore your child's bad behavior and make it everybody else's problem

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.001
the second easiest in my opinion is authoritarian parenting

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:30.041
because it is effective

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:32.281
because if you threaten someone with physical violence

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:36.061
they will a lot of the times submit to your rule

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.840
that doesn't work for everyone however

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:40.361
because there are types of people who would rather watch the world burn

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:42.521
than submit to authoritarian methods

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:46.461
and then the third and the most hard is gentle or respectful parenting

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.400
however that is the most psychologically sound for the child being brought up

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:53.441
now permissive parenting gets mistaken for gentle parenting all the time

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:56.941
and I would agree a lack of boundaries and structure is not great for kids

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.120
but the people who believe in authoritarian parenting

00:00:59.121 --> 00:00:59.961
that beating your kid

00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:03.081
or threatening them with time out to tell them to suck it up and stop crying

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:05.361
is gonna somehow produce a better generation of people

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:09.801
I would like to remind them that there are criminals and crazy people

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.961
and bad eggs and absolutely average

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:12.801
every generation

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:15.201
including the generations who got their asses beat

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:18.441
and I'm truly of the belief that you cannot beat the bad out of someone

00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:21.021
but you can absolutely beat the bad into somebody

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.640
so although we do not threaten our kids with their physical safety

00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:27.041
I can assure you that they still can follow boundaries

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:29.541
rules and are fabulous members of society

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.720
because in my opinion

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:31.921
if you threaten to spank your kid

00:01:31.922 --> 00:01:33.311
you're taking the easy way out
