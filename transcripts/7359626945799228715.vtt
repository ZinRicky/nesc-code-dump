00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.400
Let's bottle this kombucha and make a new batch.

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:05.801
For this batch, I decided to add lavender and lemon.

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.601
I've been on a real lavender kick lately,

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:10.021
and I think it's the spring summer feels.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.600
It's just so yummy.

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:15.921
So all I did was add lavender tea and squeeze two lemons

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.921
and then just add it to the bottle to kombucha.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:20.641
Some comments that I got is that this has a lot of sugar.

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:23.561
It has three fourths cups of sugar in a gallon.

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:26.121
But the kombucha eats the sugar as it ferments.

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:27.521
It has to have something to feed on.

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:30.681
I set the bottled kombucha on my counter to carbonate for two days,

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:32.181
and we're ready for another batch.
