I can't find the exact comment,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.320
but somebody's asked me multiple times

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.760
what products I use for my curls.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.160
I've posted the video of how I do my hair,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.680
and then these are the products I use.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.280
This the curl cream I use.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.580
It's by Pacifica.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.240
Pineapple Swirl Curl Defining Cream by Pacifica.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.440
This is the first thing I use on, like,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.340
really wet hair.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.400
Then this is the mousse that I really like,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.600
the Pantene Soft Curls Shaping Mousse.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.800
This is the mousse that I use.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.640
Like, I posted the video.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.520
And then if I really wanted to hold

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.080
and I really wanted to be this curly,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.040
I finished with the not your mother's curl talk.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.500
These three.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.540
These are the only things that get my hair

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.020
to look like this.
