00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
One of the most important kitchen tools

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:03.181
you're gonna need to cook from scratch.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.720
Decent set of knives. Now

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:06.161
I had a really nice knife set

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:08.221
that my husband bought me when we first got married.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.020
But it's definitely time for an upgrade.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.180
I grab this beautiful knife block.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.120
It has a sharpener

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:15.161
that's really important cause I always forget to sharpen my knives.

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:16.321
And it also has a pair of Scissors.

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:18.121
And I'm always running low on kitchen Scissors.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.761
You can always tell when a knife is good.

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:22.161
As if the solid piece of metal goes all the way through the handle.

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:24.421
And these do. So there is solid knife.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.660
They made easy work with slicing through this pineapple.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.440
I actually met my husband in Hawaii

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.441
and we used to cut up so much pineapple when we first got married.

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:33.121
Used to live right next to the doll plantation.

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:34.876
So this giving great memories today.
