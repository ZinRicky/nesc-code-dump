00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.280
around here we do not follow a public school calendar

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.040
so even though our public schools are off this week

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:05.720
we are not gonna take off Thursday and Friday

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:06.880
and just have a normal beginning of the week

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:08.360
I think it's an important time to remind you

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:10.000
that you get to homeschool however you want

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:11.480
during the holiday you can take time off

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:13.040
you can continue homeschooling like normal

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.400
you can ditch your curriculum and do a holiday themed unit study

00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:18.280
you can cut back on formal lessons to make time for seasonal activity

00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:21.760
you are going to be bombarded with a lot of things and ideas this holiday season

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.510
but you get to choose what works and what is fulfilling to your family
