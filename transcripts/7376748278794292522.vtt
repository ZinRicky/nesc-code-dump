You know when a craving hits and you can't stop thinking about it?

00:03.321 --> 00:06.061
Ever since I started using the new Lineage

00:06.080 --> 00:07.960
Watermelon Pop Lip Sleeping Mask,

00:07.961 --> 00:10.961
I've been thinking about having watermelon lavender sorbet.

00:10.962 --> 00:13.641
So today I just decided to finally make it.

00:13.642 --> 00:17.561
So I started by making a simple syrup by combining some water,

00:17.562 --> 00:18.941
sugar, and lavender.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.760
After letting that boil and steep,

00:20.761 --> 00:23.761
I transferred it over to a glass jar to cool off.

00:23.762 --> 00:26.441
In the meantime, I cut up my watermelon.

00:26.442 --> 00:30.721
Nothing screams summer more than having a good watermelon.

00:30.722 --> 00:31.881
So I cut it in half

00:31.882 --> 00:36.421
and then took the skin off before slicing it into little spears,

00:36.640 --> 00:40.160
transferred them over to my blender, and I did this in batches,

00:40.161 --> 00:43.281
blended it up, and then strained it through a strainer.

00:43.282 --> 00:43.921
At this point

00:43.922 --> 00:47.761
I added in my lavender simple syrup before giving that a good mix,

00:47.762 --> 00:50.381
adding some lemon juice and lemon zest,

00:50.400 --> 00:53.000
and I transferred it over to my ice cream Turner

00:53.001 --> 00:56.361
and let that go until it got a little bit more solid.

00:56.362 --> 00:58.201
I couldn't resist trying some,

00:58.202 --> 01:01.767
so I had two scoops and it was absolutely divine.
