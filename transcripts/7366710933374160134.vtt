00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180
I wanna uh

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.240
present a petition today signed by Canadians across the country.

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:06.361
Uh, these things are concerned about the

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:10.121
nearly hundred thousand preborn children who die every year

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:12.461
uh since the mortgage mortgage decision.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.400
Canada is only one of two uh nations in the world that has zero uh

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:18.421
laws protecting the preborn.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.480
Uh they

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:23.881
they also note that uh Charles heartbeat begins when the child is uh

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:27.641
6 weeks old and they are calling on the government of Canada

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:28.761
and this place

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:32.161
to strengthen the protections for the preborn in Canada.

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:33.261
Thank you Mister Speaker.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.880
When someone shows you who they are,

00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:39.881
believe them. The federal conservatives have attempted for many years

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:42.041
to open up a debate on abortion in Canada

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.541
by sneaking in legislation or motions

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.940
or like the petition from yesterday.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.280
Abortion is healthcare. It's as simple as that.

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:56.441
We don't legislate prostate exams or erectile dysfunction treatment

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:57.441
or breast exams

00:00:57.442 --> 00:01:02.221
or MRI's or any other healthcare procedures because it's healthcare.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.600
So don't get LED into a false sense of security about abortion access

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.661
here in Canada.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.600
The federal conservatives are trying everything they can

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.041
to legislate our healthcare

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:16.501
and they've been attempting to do so for years.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.060
So now is not the time to be complacent or to let our guard down

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.120
as I have said for many years

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:27.521
and as the federal conservatives have repeatedly shown us

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:28.701
given the chance

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.840
will attempt to limit access to abortion

00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:35.881
or attempt an outright ban on abortion.

00:01:35.882 --> 00:01:39.001
In Canada. So every opportunity that you have,

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:43.996
call out the conservatives and use your voice when it's time to vote.
