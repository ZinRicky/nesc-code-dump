00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.080
Since I've gotten older,

00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:03.641
skincare has become a much bigger part of my routine

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:05.161
and definitely helps maintenance,

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:06.761
definitely helps makeup go on better.

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:08.561
Um, so I wanna show you a couple of the things,

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:11.681
especially for anti aging, or at least with, like,

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:13.161
my skin is starting to get a little bit older.

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:14.601
I'm 36, um,

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:15.761
so I'm not, you know,

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:16.801
at mature skin yet,

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:18.441
but I'm starting to notice extra dryness,

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:20.001
fine lines, um,

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:22.681
and just some things that I want to shift in my skincare

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:25.161
to keep up with the growth and changing of my skin.

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:27.121
So I'm fresh faced right out of the shower.

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:29.501
I'm gonna start with a rosewater facial toner.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.800
I've. This one's actually from Trader Joe's, and I just soak it in.

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:36.481
I've noticed that anything with rose oil or rose water

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:37.721
is super hydrating,

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:38.561
and my skin just, like,

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:39.761
soaks it up. It loves it.

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:41.241
I then go in with a collagen serum.

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:42.401
This one's from dupology.

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:43.281
I just started using it.

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:44.921
It is incredible for, like,

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:46.501
plumping and hydrating,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.540
and you want this to be fully dry before adding thing else.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.040
So during the day,

00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:00.901
I'll just use the deepology serum

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.400
and then move on to the rest of my skincare,

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:03.201
which I'm about to do.

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:05.421
But at night, you can use these patches

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.620
that you go and put on to target fine lines and wrinkles or dry spots.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.560
I wear them overnight.

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:11.361
I get really,

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:14.841
really dry patches in my Skin, especially, like, up around my eye area,

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:15.881
and they're perfect for that.

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:17.801
I then go in for daytime with a vitamin C.

00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:18.881
This one's from typology.

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:19.861
I really like it.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.880
Let that dry and absorb,

00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:29.361
and then I'll go in with my park Perfection Eye Cream.

00:01:29.362 --> 00:01:31.501
It's kind of hard to say park perfection.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.640
Um, this is the holy grail for me.

00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:35.441
It's a small family owned business.

00:01:35.442 --> 00:01:39.181
It literally. You can watch your eyes change if you are extra baggy.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.360
I then going with a moisturizer and then followed up with SPF.

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:49.661
I really like this one from Willetta.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.400
Um, it is light but super hydrating,

00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:54.361
which again, my skin is getting a little bit extra dry.

00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:56.701
We need. We need something serious.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.080
I then use the Supergoops Unseen Sunscreen as my base,

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.441
like primer before makeup,

00:02:05.442 --> 00:02:06.601
and that's daytime skincare.

00:02:06.602 --> 00:02:08.101
I will then go into makeup.
