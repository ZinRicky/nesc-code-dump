Millennial moms,

00:01.240 --> 00:04.560
your children do not need to fit into your aesthetic.

00:04.560 --> 00:05.540
Do you see these?

00:05.760 --> 00:07.000
I'm folding laundry right now,

00:07.000 --> 00:08.680
and I fold these every single time

00:08.680 --> 00:10.000
because these are always getting washed,

00:10.000 --> 00:11.440
because they are always getting worn.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.080
These are my sons Paw Patrol jammies.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.640
He is obsessed with them.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.600
He loves them.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.840
They make his day.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.200
I don't know what he's gonna do when he doesn't

00:20.200 --> 00:21.000
fit in them anymore,

00:21.000 --> 00:22.040
cause I'm gonna have to find ones that

00:22.040 --> 00:22.640
are just like this

00:22.640 --> 00:24.760
because they make him so happy

00:24.760 --> 00:25.920
and old. Me, like,

00:25.920 --> 00:26.920
before I had kids,

00:26.920 --> 00:28.600
I would have laughed at this.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.280
I would have said,

00:29.280 --> 00:30.360
absolutely not.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.780
We are not buying this.

00:31.880 --> 00:32.920
Your clothes are gonna be cute.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.160
Your clothes are gonna be neutral.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.280
It's a lot of moms are doing,

00:35.280 --> 00:37.800
and you are robbing yourself of so much happiness.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.440
Just give in.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.080
It's so fun to just give in

00:40.080 --> 00:43.280
and let them buy the Mickey Mouse shirt.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.400
Let them buy the Pokemon backpack,

00:45.400 --> 00:47.160
the ugly, crazy

00:47.160 --> 00:48.300
wild colors.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.580
Buy it for them.

00:49.680 --> 00:50.800
Watch how happy they are.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.560
It's so cute.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.800
It's way cuter than neutrals.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.800
Way cuter. Besides,

00:54.800 --> 00:56.160
we all know that we're gonna look back in,

00:56.160 --> 00:57.560
like, 20 years from now and think

00:57.560 --> 00:59.720
that all the neutral color stuff is ugly anyway,

00:59.720 --> 01:01.500
so might as well have fun.
