00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.280
I am so paranoid about my mouth and what it smells like

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:05.961
what my breath is like from this really mean person

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:11.601
I had a really crappy partner that used to manipulate me in arguments by saying

00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:12.701
my breath stink

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.440
so soon as I would bring up an argument

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:15.001
he would be like

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:16.441
oh god your breath kinda smells

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:17.281
can we talk about this later

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:17.801
and I'd be like

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:19.481
oh my god like immediately

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:21.521
oh my god but like

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.321
all the time and I went

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.441
it gave me such dental paranoia

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:26.841
I went to the dentist

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:29.121
I got all kinds of work done on my mouth

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.081
and I asked the dentist like

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:31.201
okay the I

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:32.001
I'm good right

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:32.481
like there should

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:33.921
I mean I got a deep deep

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:35.561
I've done everything to my mouth

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:36.481
and he would still be like

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:37.281
girl

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.800
can we talk your breath

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:39.961
I can't what did you eat

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:41.601
and I would just be so paranoid

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:42.601
and that just stuck with me

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:43.481
like looking back now

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:44.981
that's bullshit that

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.920
that was just his

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:49.021
he knew that was the quickest way to get me to shut up and that's what he used

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.400
but it did give me and

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.241
and keep this like

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:54.861
paranoia about my mouth and the smell that comes from it

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.500
so I love this toothbrush from the TikTok shop

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.120
it got all these different settings

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:02.481
I just used a cleaning setting

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:03.001
but it does have

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:04.841
even for sensitive okay

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:07.841
the head of the brush is so small you can only put a pea sized amount

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:09.201
which is the appropriate amount

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.881
it's also small so it really fits in your mouth really nice and easily

00:01:11.882 --> 00:01:12.681
it's like super comfy

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:15.601
I just I'm not even trying to be stupid

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:20.361
but that this toothbrush makes me feel very confident about my breath

00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:23.421
like I know it's getting all up in there

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.380
it's linked right here if you wanna get one cause I love this thing
