00:00.000 --> 00:02.547
I'm in the mood for pancakes this morning 

00:02.547 --> 00:05.094
and my dad brought me flour from Germany, 

00:05.094 --> 00:07.156
so now we make pancakes together. 

00:07.162 --> 00:08.769
There is no recipe for this. 

00:08.772 --> 00:10.637
I'll just take 2 eggs. 

00:10.641 --> 00:11.995
Let's start with the eggs. 

00:12.440 --> 00:13.623
I burned myself up here too, 

00:13.623 --> 00:15.297
with my straightening iron this morning. 

00:17.450 --> 00:19.747
Normally I would use n rod mixer, 

00:19.747 --> 00:21.234
but I don't have one, 

00:21.234 --> 00:22.586
so I use the mixer. 

00:23.030 --> 00:24.976
Let's put a little milk in it. 

00:24.981 --> 00:27.073
I don't have vanilla sugar, 

00:27.073 --> 00:29.688
so I'll just take vanilla extract. 

00:31.086 --> 00:32.512
I use spelt flour. 

00:32.606 --> 00:35.312
That's how my dad used to do them when we were little. 

00:35.526 --> 00:36.747
I think we'll start with that. 

00:40.176 --> 00:42.647
This is the consistency we are looking for. 

00:43.036 --> 00:45.584
Just warm up the pan and then I put some 

00:45.584 --> 00:48.443
butter in it and then we put our dough in it. 

00:51.917 --> 00:54.159
I did not succeed in the 1st pancake. 

00:55.117 --> 00:56.818
We'll try right at the 2. 

00:58.477 --> 00:59.587
This is now our 2. 

00:59.587 --> 01:00.387
Try. 

01:00.737 --> 01:03.289
People said yesterday, 

01:03.289 --> 01:04.621
thanks dad. 

01:04.621 --> 01:07.452
I always make applesauce on the pancake, 

01:07.452 --> 01:10.767
but I also made n few days ago raspberry sauce, 

01:10.767 --> 01:12.978
so I make the also still on it. 

01:16.065 --> 01:17.450
This is what the whole thing looks like then. 

01:17.705 --> 01:19.750
Sometimes I put powdered sugar on it, 

01:19.750 --> 01:22.603
not today and this is how I make my German pancakes.
