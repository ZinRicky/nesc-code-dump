00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.560
Please look up the sunk cost fallacy.

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:04.801
This is what you're falling into.

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:06.561
There are a ton of fucking fallacies.

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:08.401
And if you didn't learn this shit in English class,

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:10.381
your fucking high school teacher failed you.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.560
These are just logical fucking fallacies.

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:15.641
Like it's logical mistakes that people make

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:18.321
in making decisions that cause us to stumble.

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:19.721
And they're so fucking common

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:21.601
there's a name for them. You feel like, oh,

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:23.001
I've invested so much time,

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:24.201
money, energy,

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:27.181
whatever the fuck, the resources that you feel is limited,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.480
I've sunk all this into this thing,

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:32.041
so I have to keep going.

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:36.241
But that's exactly how those motherfuckers on the submarine ended up

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:37.641
where they ended up.

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:40.161
Because you don't have to keep going with something

00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:41.841
just cause you put a bunch into it.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:45.201
I admire the fucking women who have the nerve to like,

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:46.521
walk away on their wedding day.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:48.721
Or literally like, I'm not,

00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:50.241
I'm. I don't give a fuck how many deposits,

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:51.001
I don't give a. How many.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:52.681
Fuck, how many people are disappointed,

00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:53.441
I'm not going through with it,

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:54.041
I can't, I can't.

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:55.381
And they listen to themselves.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.520
Because you're just saving yourself so much trouble in the end.

00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:59.961
Because you know what? If you feel this way,

00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:02.341
I guarantee you the relationship's gonna end.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.960
And when it does, at that point,

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:08.001
the only thing you'll regret is, fuck,

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.801
why didn't I leave the first fucking time?

00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:14.181
So I'm telling you with every ounce of passion,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.700
In my body. Samantha,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.020
Nana, you and every other one of you watching.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.000
If you have that feeling, it's not gonna get any better.

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.361
This person is not gonna magically stop abusing you.

00:01:27.362 --> 00:01:28.681
He's not gonna. Magic.

00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:31.481
If he's over 25, his brain is fully developed.

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:34.041
If he's over thirty. Girl,

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:35.681
not only is his brain fully developed,

00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:37.561
he's now an old dog set in his ways.

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:39.621
Ain't gonna teach him no new fucking tricks.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.940
Save yourself.
