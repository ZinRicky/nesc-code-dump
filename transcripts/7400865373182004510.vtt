00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.120
have almost made it to the end of our first week of school

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:05.280
and honestly we have been way more productive than I thought we would be around

00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:06.760
schooling really paid off for us this year

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:08.520
we finished up our study on the state of Delaware

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.680
and it has been a fan favorite

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.040
so I thought I'd share a little bit about how we handle US geography

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:14.600
for starters it is one of those subjects that I do a learning journal with

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.160
because I wanted to be able to use our curriculum

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:17.480
plus pull from our own experience

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:18.440
experiences in our own travel

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:20.800
we're using the our 50 States curriculum by Not Grass

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:23.320
my kids decided they wanted to start with the state that we have traveled to

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:25.760
so I put all of the names of those states in a jar

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:28.040
and we pick from one every time we're ready to study a new state

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:29.840
Madison pooled South Carolina as our next state

00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:33.360
so to prepare I'm gonna make a copy of the state outline from the Not Grass workbook

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.480
then I'll print out some pictures from our trips to South Carolina

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:37.800
then I like to find a coloring page from the state on Google

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.120
I try to find one that includes like

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:40.720
state birds state flowers

00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:41.960
state Free state animal

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:44.000
things like that and then on our next geography day

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.240
I'll read from the textbook while they colour the picture

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:47.360
they glue everything in their journal

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:48.520
we watch a homeschool pop video

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:50.400
and then we might do one of the activities in the book if we like

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:52.360
the next day we work on writing captions for the picture

00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:53.760
and this is where I work on the writing skills

00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:55.080
right now we're working on capitalization

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:57.360
how to abbreviate and how to write city commerces

00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:58.240
as the year progresses

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:00.520
I'll start to add more writing prompts in for my second grade

00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:03.160
and then we finish every state by coloring that state on our coloring

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:05.760
you have other questions about our geography study that I didn't answer

00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:06.878
drop them in the comments
