00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.520
The Me Too movement was called radical when

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:03.721
essentially it was just like,

00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:04.901
women being like,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.360
can we just work,

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:09.961
like, in peace without your dicks in our faces?

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:12.641
And the abortion rights movement has always been called radical.

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:15.761
But do you wanna say the word when it's literally,

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:17.061
just let me have my body.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.800
It's, I don't even want extra.

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:20.001
I don't want anything special.

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:25.241
The reaction to feminism is not commensurate with the size

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:27.441
are the magnitude of the demands that we're making.

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:28.241
Is always been

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:29.841
commiserate with the size

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:33.241
of male discomfort with women having these simple things.

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:36.921
Almost funny to see at what lengths, like,

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:41.541
someone will go to in order to curb these very small

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.760
that we're asking for.

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:44.481
Like, the amount of money that spent,

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:46.401
like, even just as Harvey Weinstein case like that,

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:49.961
there were like millions and on trying to overturn his rape prevention.

00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:51.641
And like, 100 women have accused you, dude,

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:52.481
like, what are you even.

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:53.321
Why are you focused?

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:55.304
Like, go get a. Get a wife.
