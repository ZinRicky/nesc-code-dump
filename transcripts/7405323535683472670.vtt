00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.680
I feel like the only appropriate way to describe the tiredness

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:05.921
from being a single mom is, like,

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:09.501
I'm tired to the depths of my soul.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.680
Like, I am tired in every little box you can think of,

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:20.461
of tiredness. I am at the max capacity of all of them,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.380
you know?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.460
And the thing about loving your children is that it, like,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.800
it's the deepest love, so it feels like it fills every box as well.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.361
And so there's, like,

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:38.741
so much hurt with that love,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.760
you know? Like,

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:46.441
you know how much hurt they're gonna go through because they have to.

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:47.961
Like, that's just life.

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:50.981
Somebody's gonna talk shit about you and it's gonna hurt your feelings,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.860
but you don't want that to happen cause it's your baby.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.840
Like Fucking Colin Farrell.

00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:02.981
I want the world to be nice to my son.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.440
Yeah. And then

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:06.241
I bet you think back

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:08.681
of all the times that you used a word inappropriately

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.881
or looked at somebody and laughed or something,

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:11.701
you know,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.240
when my daughter was born with down syndrome,

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.181
I was like,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.140
every time I had ever seen someone use the R word,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.380
you know? So

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.360
motherhood is like, it.

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:28.921
It's like, max capacity for everything.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.641
It is the max capacity of, like,

00:01:30.642 --> 00:01:34.421
love for my children and every depth of love,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.660
but that includes all the darkness that love has,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.580
the fear and the worry and the.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.020
Anyway, it's my daughter's birthday, so I'm hauling my feels.
