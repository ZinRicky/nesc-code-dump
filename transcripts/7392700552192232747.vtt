00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.080
Let's get ready for date night in, like,

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:05.241
20 minutes. I've already done my base and my eyebrows.

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:06.161
I'm just gonna do, like,

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:10.801
a really quick. I like a really light one,

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:12.441
because I wanna do a full,

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:15.561
bold red lip. We're going to a caviar bar tonight,

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:17.301
which I think leads, like,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.120
dramatic,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.480
elegant. So I'm just doing a really,

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:22.161
really light smoky eye. Like,

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:23.921
just a teeny little touch, um,

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:25.281
with this color in the crease,

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:28.821
and then this one just in the outer corner.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.620
And I always do a little bit of this silk teddy just in this corner,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.220
and then I'll do my wing.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.060
I'm gonna go in with the tattoo liner and just do a little wing

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.360
and drag that out.

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:52.281
I usually connect the top and the bottom to make a little triangle,

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:56.921
and then fill it in and then just connect it to the inner corner.

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:58.641
Now for a red lip, I'm trying a new one.

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:01.001
I've been really liking the Pat Mcgrath red,

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.741
and this is actually gonna be Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood fixin.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.400
Now,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.520
I'm always on the hunt for a good red,

00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:14.801
and this is a good red. I've always liked Charlotte Tilbury's lipsticks.

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:16.681
I know they're a little bit on the pricey side,

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:19.041
but they go on creamy, and they are just, like,

00:01:19.042 --> 00:01:21.161
so hydrating and really pigmented,

00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:22.501
and I really love them.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.580
I'm gonna finish off with a little bit of highlight just up here on

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.240
the cheek bone. Um,

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:32.561
and this is benefit Watts Up.

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:34.281
I've used it to hell. I fucking love it.

00:01:34.282 --> 00:01:35.801
It's really great. Um,

00:01:35.802 --> 00:01:37.281
but that's the whole makeup look.

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:38.841
I'm gonna have to do a part two for getting dressed

00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:39.761
because I don't want this to be,

00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:41.541
like a seven minute long video.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.340
Um, so go for part two for the outfit.
