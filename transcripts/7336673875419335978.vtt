00:00.080 --> 00:01.880
I don't like a lot of baked desserts.

00:01.880 --> 00:02.880
I don't like cakes,

00:02.880 --> 00:03.480
the cookies,

00:03.480 --> 00:04.360
the cupcakes.

00:04.360 --> 00:07.200
But I do love a really good pavlova,

00:07.200 --> 00:08.640
and today I was craving one,

00:08.640 --> 00:10.500
so that's exactly what I made.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.400
I started by separating my egg whites from my yolks

00:13.400 --> 00:14.520
and whipping those up

00:14.520 --> 00:17.800
and slowly incorporating sugar into that mixture

00:17.800 --> 00:20.600
until it got to the consistency I wanted.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.960
I pulled out my whisk,

00:21.960 --> 00:25.580
and I knew it was ready when I saw the stiff peaks form.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.200
Then I put in some powdered sugar and some vanilla.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.840
Once that was all incorporated,

00:30.840 --> 00:34.080
I scoop my meringue onto my baking sheet

00:34.080 --> 00:36.520
and create a little wells in the middle.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.880
Then I let those bake for about an hour and a half

00:38.880 --> 00:41.460
and let them cool for another hour in the oven.

00:41.840 --> 00:42.560
In the meantime,

00:42.560 --> 00:44.700
I made a little peach puree.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.680
I just let my peaches boil on the stove

00:46.680 --> 00:49.100
with some maple syrup and some lemon

00:49.400 --> 00:51.260
and then blended it all up.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.320
Combination of peach and passion fruit is so good.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.500
So I added some passion fruit to my peach puree

00:57.640 --> 01:00.200
and then moved on to making my whipped cream.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.600
I was feeling girly today,

01:01.600 --> 01:03.000
so I made it pink

01:03.000 --> 01:06.800
and then decided to assemble my little pavlovas.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.040
I washed and cut all of my berries,

01:09.040 --> 01:11.400
and then it was time to assemble.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.860
So I took my merengue,

01:13.160 --> 01:15.800
spoon, the whipped cream into the wells we created,

01:15.800 --> 01:17.280
topped it with the passion fruit

01:17.280 --> 01:18.320
peach puree.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.020
And all of the berries.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.440
I also added some mint to it.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.848
The consistency of these was divine.
