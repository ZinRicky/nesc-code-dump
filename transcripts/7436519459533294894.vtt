00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
So, as I said,

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:03.001
I'm starting to learn more about this concept.

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.881
So these are the books that I'm going to be reading.

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:06.361
It's gonna take me a while to get through them,

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:08.661
but we are going to learn together.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.840
Um, the living goddesses who cooked the last supper,

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:14.401
women's history of the world before war,

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:15.601
on marriage, hierarchy,

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:17.201
and our matriarchal origins,

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:18.661
when god was a woman,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.520
and societies of peace. Matriarchs past,

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:23.681
present, and future.

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:25.801
In my last post, a couple people called me out,

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:27.681
rightly so, on the fact that

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:31.321
I kind of made it sound like matriarchy was just opposite patriarchy,

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.081
and that I know is not true.

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:34.401
I know it's a completely different system

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:37.641
that values community care above,

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:39.121
like, a hierarchical structure.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:42.601
But again, this is something that I'm just starting to deep dive into.

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:44.481
So if you wanna deep dive into it with me,

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:46.541
um, those books are where I'm starting.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.360
If you have other book recommendations,

00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:49.871
I would love to take them as well.
