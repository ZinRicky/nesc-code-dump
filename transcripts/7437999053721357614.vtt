00:00.000 --> 00:01.760
The last time I got ginger ale,

00:01.761 --> 00:05.761
it was flat, and it was all around just a disappointing experience.

00:05.762 --> 00:07.241
And since I was craving one,

00:07.242 --> 00:09.001
I knew that as soon as I got home,

00:09.002 --> 00:11.041
I had to just make myself one.

00:11.042 --> 00:15.201
I started by peeling all of my ginger and slicing it into pieces.

00:15.202 --> 00:17.841
I prefer doing this over grating it.

00:17.842 --> 00:19.441
I transferred it over to a bowl

00:19.442 --> 00:23.741
and got started on making a simple syrup by combining water and sugar.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.040
Let that warm up until the sugar dissolved

00:26.041 --> 00:29.681
before adding in all of my ginger and returning it to the heat.

00:29.682 --> 00:31.081
I let it come to a boil

00:31.082 --> 00:35.221
and then reduce that to a simmer and let that go for about 15 minutes

00:35.240 --> 00:37.360
and then let it sit for another 30.

00:37.361 --> 00:38.921
Once it was done steeping,

00:38.922 --> 00:41.201
I strained it through a fine mesh strainer

00:41.202 --> 00:44.241
and transferred it over to a smaller container

00:44.242 --> 00:47.801
so that I could cool down in the fridge for about 45 minutes.

00:47.802 --> 00:49.081
And that's all I had to do.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.801
I filled my glass with some ice,

00:50.802 --> 00:53.381
the syrup, topped it with some soda water,

00:53.440 --> 00:56.600
and I always need to have my ginger ales with a fresh squeeze of lime,

00:56.601 --> 00:58.441
so that's exactly what I did,

00:58.442 --> 01:01.976
and this was exactly why I was craving. And it was heavenly.
