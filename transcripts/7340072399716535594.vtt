00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:37.661
you can read about her in the books

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.600

00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:46.481
California which is a very small town

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:47.921
wow so I just like

00:01:47.922 --> 00:01:50.661

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.460

I was a travel student

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.560
right that they were people that were close to me in the family that

00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:04.121

00:02:09.722 --> 00:02:10.241
yeah you know

00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:13.921
I had been acting since I got my first part when I was 19

00:02:13.922 --> 00:02:15.841
wow with and was that bonanza

00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:17.121
what was your first part

00:02:17.122 --> 00:02:18.721
was the Loretta Young show

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:22.221
okay and that was about 1961

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.500
um I was about nineteen

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.560
so yeah I started real early

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:27.761
and I did all of those

00:02:27.762 --> 00:02:28.921
with Westerns

00:02:28.922 --> 00:02:29.521
the bananas and

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:32.821
Gunsmoke Medical Center FBI

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.020
my three sons

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.780
that's your father

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.240
you know and you were just having the time of your life

00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:40.801
doing all that

00:02:40.802 --> 00:02:42.281
I thought it was a dream

00:02:42.282 --> 00:02:43.521
was it a dream come true for you

00:02:43.522 --> 00:02:44.401
yeah well you know

00:02:44.402 --> 00:02:45.561
I never really thought about it

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:46.441
when I was growing up

00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:47.381
I didn't say

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.640
I wanna act yeah

00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:52.861
but I was a very bad student in high school

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.240
and I wasn't gonna be able to go to college

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:58.901
wow because all my friends were going to Yale and Harvard and

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.980
I saw an advertisement on the back of teen magazine

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.240
and it was for the Passagena Playhouse

00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:08.221
the State Theater California

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.760
and it was Earl Hall

00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:12.101
and it was a former student there

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.820
and so I thought

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.100
I can do that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.360
so I sent away for an application

00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:19.841
wow and I was accepted

00:03:19.842 --> 00:03:23.101
and then I told my mother and she said

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.260
well we'll see about this

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.640
and we drove to Pasadena and she was very impressed wow

00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:32.561
I mean it's a seven story building

00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:34.721
it's got six theaters in it

00:03:34.722 --> 00:03:36.801
I would have to live in a dormitory

00:03:36.802 --> 00:03:38.361
wow so it I mean

00:03:38.362 --> 00:03:40.941
it was everything that she wished for me

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.800
get away from UVA City

00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:44.361
live in a dormitory

00:03:44.362 --> 00:03:45.641
do something new

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.841
yeah she had no idea what it to do

00:03:47.842 --> 00:03:49.481
right and um

00:03:49.482 --> 00:03:50.981
and that's how it started

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.180
and I got my first job at 19 on the Loretta Young show wow

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.600
with already young

00:03:57.601 --> 00:03:58.881
perfect love

00:03:58.882 --> 00:04:00.941
that sounds so good

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.760
so out of all the episodes

00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:04.281
cause you were in four seasons

00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:06.541
what was your favorite episode to film

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.160
maybe not what was your favorite episode

00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:09.641
like overall or both

00:04:09.642 --> 00:04:11.121
what was your favorite episode that like

00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:13.041
sticks in your memory when you think about Little House

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:14.481
and your time on Little House of life

00:04:14.482 --> 00:04:16.161
I loved filming that episode

00:04:16.162 --> 00:04:17.041
that was so much fun

00:04:17.042 --> 00:04:20.901
okay it's gotta be when Miss Fetal marries pig farmer

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.000
and you know

00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:26.261
if they actually gave this beetle a whole episode

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.080
yeah you did

00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:29.361
you had your own special little moment exactly

00:04:29.362 --> 00:04:30.681
and now you deserved it

00:04:30.682 --> 00:04:31.981
Allison did too

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.580
now Nelly meets the pig farmer's son Luke

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.080
and falls in love with him

00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:37.761
and you know

00:04:37.762 --> 00:04:40.101
it's a whole story about how she she

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.920
she gets to marry Luke

00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:44.801
and then Missus Olsen comes and you know

00:04:44.802 --> 00:04:46.001
blows it all apart

00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:47.361
so it's fun to do

00:04:47.362 --> 00:04:48.561
I bet that was a fun time

00:04:48.562 --> 00:04:51.121
and also because the actor that played my husband

00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:54.581

was the student at the passing in the playhouse when I was there

00:05:00.402 --> 00:05:03.581
so we had known each other since we were 17

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.920

00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:05.921
it was great

00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:07.681

she was wonderful yeah

00:05:39.762 --> 00:05:41.781
and she was outrageous on the show

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.640
four years was it

00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:44.961
about four years of you

00:05:44.962 --> 00:05:46.761
of you filming um

00:05:46.762 --> 00:05:49.361
what is one of your favorite memories of Michael Landon

00:05:49.362 --> 00:05:52.201
I know we've talked some about your audition um

00:05:52.202 --> 00:05:53.321
overall but and

00:05:53.322 --> 00:05:55.401
and how you got the part to begin with

00:05:55.402 --> 00:05:59.181
but do you have a specific favorite memory with Michael um

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.880
first of all

00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:03.341
he's one of the best directors I've ever worked with

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.640
he's a family man and what he

00:06:05.641 --> 00:06:08.161
what he like to do was shoot in a way

00:06:08.162 --> 00:06:11.541
so that we were done by 6 o'clock at night

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.640
I was on all these shows where they would work until midnight

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:17.241
bring us in at six in the morning

00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:20.901
I don't know how crews even had family lives

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.720
but Michael had

00:06:21.721 --> 00:06:23.161
Michael was family man

00:06:23.162 --> 00:06:25.281
so he shot very economically

00:06:25.282 --> 00:06:27.201
and I love that so I

00:06:27.202 --> 00:06:29.341
I enjoyed working with him

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.040
but I'll tell you

00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:32.841
my best friend on the show is Victor French

00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:34.681

00:06:34.682 --> 00:06:37.161
yes we became such good friends

00:06:37.162 --> 00:06:38.201
and I think I

00:06:38.202 --> 00:06:41.441
I spent more time with Victor than anybody really yeah

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:42.741
that's beautiful

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.360
