Yesterday, a troll on the internet told me

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.460
that my look was not daytime appropriate.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.140
And I can't help but think,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.940
what about this one?

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.860
Daytime, nighttime appropriate.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.340
No one cares.
