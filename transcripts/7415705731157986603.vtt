00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
My brother flew all the way out from Germany to be with us in London

00:03.401 --> 00:05.161
for less than 48 hours

00:05.162 --> 00:08.481
so that lucky and I can go to the Burberry show together.

00:08.482 --> 00:10.441
The jet lag has been hitting me hard.

00:10.442 --> 00:12.041
I can barely get out of bed,

00:12.042 --> 00:13.881
but I put my alarm in the other room,

00:13.882 --> 00:15.881
so I literally am forced to.

00:15.882 --> 00:18.481
Luckily, whimsy was still sleeping when we got up.

00:18.482 --> 00:20.401
We let her sleep, hopped in the shower,

00:20.402 --> 00:23.081
did our skincare, and ordered some breakfast.

00:23.082 --> 00:24.921
I'm usually not hungry in the mornings,

00:24.922 --> 00:28.681
but lucky got these really good waffles I can't say no to.

00:28.682 --> 00:30.601
And right as we were wrapping up breakfast,

00:30.602 --> 00:33.001
whimsy woke up, and then my brother got in.

00:33.002 --> 00:35.881
He was on whimsy duty pretty much all day long.

00:35.882 --> 00:38.641
Right after he got there, the Burberry team got there,

00:38.642 --> 00:40.321
and the Vogue team got there.

00:40.322 --> 00:43.641
Today felt so exciting since we were shooting a Vogue video

00:43.642 --> 00:46.121
while we were getting ready for the Burberry show.

00:46.122 --> 00:48.321
My makeup, we went with a very 90s,

00:48.322 --> 00:50.921
simple makeup look. And for my hair,

00:50.922 --> 00:55.921
we went with a very fun updo that was more of an undone type situation.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.401
And since lucky was mic'd up,

00:57.402 --> 00:58.801
I helped him get dressed,

00:58.802 --> 01:02.041
and then he went over and shot his last little shots.

01:02.042 --> 01:04.761
Lindsay obviously needed to come say hi to everyone,

01:04.762 --> 01:07.681
since she's very social. So after she did that,

01:07.682 --> 01:09.881
lucky helped me get into my outfit.

01:09.882 --> 01:11.481
Once we were done shooting The video.

01:11.482 --> 01:12.921
We had to rush out the door

01:12.922 --> 01:15.481
since we were gonna run late on the way to the venue.

01:15.482 --> 01:19.601
Lucky got so tired that he just fell asleep right before we got there.

01:19.602 --> 01:20.761
I woke him up.

01:20.762 --> 01:23.481
I always get pretty nervous before getting out of the car

01:23.482 --> 01:26.921
because there's so many people taking pictures and videos

01:26.922 --> 01:29.521
and yelling at you. Once that part is done,

01:29.522 --> 01:31.401
we went inside to find our seats,

01:31.402 --> 01:34.161
and it's always nice to see familiar faces,

01:34.162 --> 01:36.202
and the show was absolutely stunning.
