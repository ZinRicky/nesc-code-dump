Wow. It has been a whole year and a half since I have been here online,

00:04.360 --> 00:08.420
sharing my lifestyle and talking about traditional marriage.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.960
I want to show you guys.

00:09.961 --> 00:13.641
This is the very first video that I ever made that went viral,

00:13.642 --> 00:16.501
and it was the video that started my whole channel.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.960
And when I posted this,

00:17.961 --> 00:21.621
this went viral for a lot of bad reasons,

00:21.880 --> 00:26.580
but it also still remains to be my most liked video on my channel.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.440
And, yes, these are ads.

00:28.441 --> 00:31.661
These are 50s ads from the 1950s.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.940
But why is it that this video has so many likes?

00:35.160 --> 00:41.040
Maybe it's because when other women like me see pictures like this,

00:41.041 --> 00:41.681
that, yes,

00:41.682 --> 00:44.221
our ads, they're not real pictures.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.360
It still represents a lifestyle.

00:46.361 --> 00:49.261
It represents a simple way of living.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.820
It represents traditional marriage.

00:52.840 --> 00:53.840
And you know what?

00:53.841 --> 00:56.561
It makes us women feel warm and cozy inside

00:56.562 --> 00:58.441
seeing videos and pictures like this.

00:58.442 --> 01:01.781
These ads represent a more simple life,

01:02.000 --> 01:03.080
and that for a woman,

01:03.081 --> 01:06.201
being a wife and being a mother is enough.

01:06.202 --> 01:07.841
I remember when I posted this,

01:07.842 --> 01:12.441
I got so many comments, and people were trying to say, well,

01:12.442 --> 01:13.821
where the women of color?

01:14.040 --> 01:17.320
But I had about 200 followers before I posted this video.

01:17.321 --> 01:19.301
And when I made this video,

01:19.320 --> 01:22.760
I was choosing ads of women that looked similar to me.

01:22.761 --> 01:25.641
That was all. And I remember thinking,

01:25.642 --> 01:26.841
did I do something wrong?

01:26.842 --> 01:28.541
Do I need to delete my post?

01:28.640 --> 01:30.400
But then I started posting more online

01:30.401 --> 01:31.601
and I started realizing

01:31.602 --> 01:35.261
that there is a lot of negativity about having a platform online.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.740
And that was just something I came to accept.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.640
The traditional wife community

01:39.641 --> 01:42.361
is not pushing this lifestyle onto anybody.

01:42.362 --> 01:46.221
We are simply sharing the feminine freedom we have

01:46.280 --> 01:49.660
from choosing this lifestyle over having a career.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.420
And that is okay if you want one or the other.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.840
Since it's been a year and a half,

01:53.841 --> 01:56.481
I just wanna thank you all so much for the support

01:56.482 --> 01:58.461
and love that you give my page.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.520
You all are the reason I keep going.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.361
And I have to say,

02:02.362 --> 02:06.281
after I posted that and the response I got from that video,

02:06.282 --> 02:10.081
it really. It really triggered something in me to keep going

02:10.082 --> 02:13.781
and keep posting about a life that is so misunderstood.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.700
And so that's what I've tried to do here on my channel.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.200
And, um, my content is not perfect.

02:19.201 --> 02:20.001
My.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.760
The way I speak and the way I portray things is not always perfect.

02:24.761 --> 02:26.161
And I'm sorry about that.

02:26.162 --> 02:27.481
But I am a human.

02:27.482 --> 02:29.041
And I hope you guys understand

02:29.042 --> 02:30.801
there will be times that I delete things

02:30.802 --> 02:33.801
that maybe I'm not the most proud that I posted.

02:33.802 --> 02:34.781
And that's okay.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.040
It's a learning journey.

02:36.041 --> 02:39.181
And yeah, being here online has definitely been a journey.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.660
But anyways, I just wanted to kind of give a little

02:43.360 --> 02:46.960
remembrance post to my first post that went viral ever.

02:46.961 --> 02:49.941
And I wanted to thank you guys for your love and your support.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.460
Have a great day. Bye.
