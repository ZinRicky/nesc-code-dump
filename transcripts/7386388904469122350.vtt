00:00.000 --> 00:02.460
We're gonna be using this tiny little microphone.

00:03.040 --> 00:06.920
I'm an ASMR girly, so I love watching these videos.

00:06.921 --> 00:10.541
I got some donuts yesterday at Sidecar.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.920
This is what we're working with.

00:13.921 --> 00:17.581
We got six different flavors, so let's try.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.260
These are all the flavors we're working with.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.240
I don't remember a lot of them,

00:28.241 --> 00:30.341
so let's just try them together.

00:30.360 --> 00:34.760
This is our first donut. I think it's an old fashioned with nutmeg,

00:34.761 --> 00:37.541
cinnamon and some buttermilk.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.760
I've heard that these are really,

00:39.761 --> 00:45.041
really good doughnuts. I love the texture of it and it's not too sweet,

00:45.042 --> 00:47.501
so I give it an 8 out of 10.

00:47.520 --> 00:50.160
Maple bacon one. Lucky picked this one,

00:50.161 --> 00:52.941
so I'm gonna have the tiniest little sliver of it.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.400
This seems really intimidating.

00:55.401 --> 00:57.601
I don't know whether I would usually go for this,

00:57.602 --> 00:59.861
but let's give it a try.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.700
Hmm.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.440
Surprisingly, that was so good.

01:08.441 --> 01:10.301
I give that a nine out of 10.

01:10.440 --> 01:13.640
There's something about this sweet and savory aspect of this

01:13.641 --> 01:16.481
that I really like, which I didn't think I would.

01:16.482 --> 01:19.021
My daughter requested the one with the sprinkles,

01:19.160 --> 01:22.180
so I'm also gonna just have a tiny little bite of it.

01:22.320 --> 01:25.420
I think this one is called confetti cake.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.160
The texture of this looks a little bit different,

01:28.161 --> 01:29.701
but let's give it a try.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.100
Mmhm.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.680
It was my least favorite one so far.

01:39.681 --> 01:42.741
It tasted more like a cake than a donut.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.820
I didn't like that. Didn't like the flavors of it.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.280
I give That one, a two out of 10.

01:48.281 --> 01:50.901
Next up we have the huckleberry donut.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.880
I first got introduced to huckleberries

01:53.881 --> 01:56.581
when I went to Montana about three years ago,

01:56.600 --> 02:00.020
and they're so good. So I'm very excited for this one.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.080
The flavor is really good.

02:04.081 --> 02:06.121
I'm not a fan of the texture. Again,

02:06.122 --> 02:08.941
it tastes more like a cake than a donut.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.280
I do like the Berry flavor of it.

02:11.281 --> 02:13.581
I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 10.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.120
I don't even remember what this one was,

02:16.121 --> 02:18.781
but I think it was a cinnamon churro one.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.460
Again,

02:24.320 --> 02:26.160
it tastes more like a cake.

02:26.161 --> 02:29.221
I don't know what it is about these last three donuts.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.040
That one was the most underwhelming one.

02:32.041 --> 02:36.921
I get that one out of 10. First two actually really surprised me.

02:36.922 --> 02:41.205
All in all, the maple bacon one won this little contest for me.
