00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.620
I mean, how much more degrading can you possibly be about being home?

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.560
This is a lifestyle many women choose,

00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:07.321
and they absolutely love this lifestyle.

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:09.621
I absolutely love this lifestyle.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.920
We don't think most of us have Plan b's.

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:13.681
Worst case scenario situations.

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:16.041
The fact is that everyone should have a Plan B

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:17.661
worst case scenario situation.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.920
A woman who is also working and has a career,

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:21.001
if her husband dies

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.081
and they have a joint mortgage or something like that,

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:26.701
they would have to figure out a way to replace that income.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.840
A lot of us have skills that are transferable to a job force.

00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:33.041
It's not gonna be like business or CEO or like

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:34.601
those kinds of positions,

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:36.881
but it's not that we're incapable of taking

00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:37.961
and providing for our families

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:39.021
if we had to.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.560
And the thing is, is a lot of us have worked before staying home.

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.221
So we do have a resume.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.760
Doesn't mean it's gonna be consistent and updated or like, whatever.

00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:50.921
But again, there are transferable skills that one can have.

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:51.801
There's trades women.

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:54.081
That women can learn and work out of their home and do.

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:56.741
So it's not that we're helpless little doves.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.480
Women who are traditional and stay home

00:00:58.481 --> 00:00:59.481
would do the same exact thing

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:01.881
a woman who has a career and worked outside of the home would do.

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:03.741
And that is figure that crap out.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.580
It's the worst case scenario for a lot of people,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.680
and they figure it Out

00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:08.921
and they move on with their lives

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:10.841
and they get help from people in their lives.

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:12.921
And that's why community is so important.

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:14.521
So yes, it is a lifestyle,

00:01:14.522 --> 00:01:17.378
but just cause you don't value it doesn't make it less of a lifestyle.
