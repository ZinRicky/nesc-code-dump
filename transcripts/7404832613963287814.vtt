00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.640
I am pleased to announce an investment of almost $1 million to Tina

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:06.501
Safe Haven,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:14.440
a 24 hour drop in center run by Nadine Away for youth aged 13 to 24.

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:17.201
This funding will support operations

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:19.661
and programming at Tina Safe Haven,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.540
including counseling, support program, mentors,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.660
resources and healthcare from an indigenous lead perspective

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.240
with a focus on relationship building.

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:35.821
What I am excited about is Manitoba

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.200
investing over $20 million into creating that change.

00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:45.141
Tina's death brought forward so much for us,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.280
but it shouldn't have happened.

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:52.121
We should not have had to lose her in order for systems to move

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:54.101
to protect and take care of.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.660
Her family gifted us the name Tina's Safe Haven.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.900
And I think for, for me,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.160
that was a, a reminder that our,

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:06.641
our lovely young woman, even in death,

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:10.821
the power of her voice and the need for ongoing change.
