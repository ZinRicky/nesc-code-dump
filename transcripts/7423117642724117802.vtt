00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.280
Today's October 7th,

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:03.641
and although I wasn't planning on making any videos today

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:05.761
because we just have a lot going on,

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:07.801
um, I wanted to Mark this day

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:11.941
because it's been a year since Hamas attacked Israel,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.380
took hostages, and Israel has retaliated with a mass casualty

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.440
bombing and displacement of the people in Gaza.

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:25.121
I never thought in a million years hostages would be taken for a year.

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:26.521
I never thought that a year later,

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:28.381
the violence would still be continuing.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.600
And through this year,

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:33.021
I've Learned that it is so hard to teach our kids

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.100
that peace on earth is a feasible goal

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.420
when you see people hate with such vigor.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.320
And over this year,

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:43.841
I've Learned something about myself and about other people,

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:46.181
and that is that most hate

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.860
comes from the fear and the misunderstanding

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.340
of people who are not like you.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.840
The belief that certain people are inherently bad

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:58.421
and certain people are inherently good or just or moral.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.140
I have seen people dehumanize an entire nation of people.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.040
And you can assume, with whatever belief systems you have,

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:07.521
which group of people I'm talking about,

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:08.901
but it's true for both.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.800
And I've Learned that the best thing that I can do

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:14.061
to actually impact change,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.080
to try and create a peaceful world for my children,

00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:21.461
for myself, for our future as humans on this planet,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.060
is to not give in to the other ring of others,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.200
to not believe that groups of people are inherently Evil

00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:31.861
or have nefarious purposes.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.260
To try to learn instead of be afraid.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.360
To keep my heart open and not harden it.

00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:42.621
To not run into the open arms of what's familiar and easy,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.660
and to sit in the truth that certain things are unjustifiable

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.480
for the Jewish people. This is the week between Rosh Hashanah,

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:51.081
our New Year, and Yom Kippur,

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:52.661
which is where we make repentance.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.200
I hope we can all reflect on what we can do individually

00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:58.661
to bring about a more peaceful world,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.340
and how we can help get the hostages home and the people of Gaza safer.
