00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
Asked all the time about our learning journals,

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:04.281
what I put in them, where I get the resources from.

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:05.801
So let's do a quick flip through

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.981
of all of the learning journals that I have,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.960
starting with reading.

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:11.281
I use a reading journal to go with our read alouds.

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:14.041
So every time I do a chapter book read aloud with the kids,

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:18.641
we go through, and we will write the title,

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:20.681
the characters, the setting,

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:21.841
and my kids draw a picture.

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:24.521
And as I'm reading, I'm asking some comprehension questions

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:26.181
about things that are happening in the book,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.160
and they will write their answer here.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.641
Now, they will tell me their answer,

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:31.001
and I write it on a whiteboard,

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.161
and they use it as copywork because they are still, like,

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:36.321
young enough for that. My daughter is just now.

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:37.201
She's in second grade,

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:39.981
getting to the point where she is writing her own sentences.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.040
But that's how I started with Copyworks.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:44.321
And every new book that we do,

00:00:44.322 --> 00:00:46.621
we make a little tab for the title.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.280
They include a title picture,

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:52.601
and just ask some questions as we go through the books.

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:54.161
Next up is our anatomy journal,

00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:56.281
and this goes with our Sassafra Science Adventure

00:00:56.282 --> 00:01:03.161
volume 2 anatomy study. And it comes with all of these different parts,

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.521
and I just glue them in here as we go.

00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:08.961
So this is the skeletal system that we are learning right now.

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:11.361
And so they'll spend one day coloring all the Pieces

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:15.801
and we glue them in. And as we go and we learn about different things,

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:19.701
they will write what they are learning right here.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.680
And then we glued in here.

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.601
We save it all in here for the whole school year.

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:27.541
And then our 50 States Journal goes with our 50 states by not grass.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.000
And we do not go in order.

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.121
We are starting with all of the states that we have been to.

00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:35.781
So they start by writing the state name.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.480
This is the state that I live in.

00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:39.761
So each time I'll either do the state nickname,

00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:41.641
the state, like when it became a state,

00:01:41.642 --> 00:01:45.481
the state hood number. And then we include an outline of the picture

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:46.761
which comes with the curriculum.

00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:50.321
And then we do pictures of anytime we've travelled.

00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:54.221
I also try to do some type of colouring picture that I find on Google.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.660
Uh, something that we are learning throughout this study.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.280
And as we go, my daughter,

00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:00.561
who is going to second grade,

00:02:00.562 --> 00:02:02.261
will write her own captions

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.080
and my first grader will tell me a caption for the picture.

00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:10.361
I also have these state flags that I bought on Amazon.

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:14.881
So every new state we add the state flag.

00:02:14.882 --> 00:02:16.101
You can see it there.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.560
And so it's just a fun way to keep memories together,

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:22.736
but also like what we're learning about throughout that state.
