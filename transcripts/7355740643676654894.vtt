I'm doing a little surprise date night tonight for my husband and I,

00:02.361 --> 00:03.961
and I'm here at the dollar store,

00:03.962 --> 00:07.541
and they have this big selection of really random,

00:07.560 --> 00:09.360
odd movies you've never heard of before,

00:09.361 --> 00:11.321
and we are gonna watch one tonight for date night.

00:11.322 --> 00:14.301
Exit plan. We have Cage Fighter,

00:14.800 --> 00:15.960
American Buffalo.

00:15.961 --> 00:17.521
Are these even real movies?

00:17.522 --> 00:18.641
Desert Dancer,

00:18.642 --> 00:19.681
dream dare dance.

00:19.682 --> 00:20.641
I almost got this one,

00:20.642 --> 00:22.621
but I didn't think my husband would like it.

00:22.640 --> 00:23.920
The Warriors way.

00:23.921 --> 00:25.641
Just so many. And who knows,

00:25.642 --> 00:27.161
maybe there are some good ones in here.

00:27.162 --> 00:28.881
I ended up looking at the horror movies,

00:28.882 --> 00:30.561
and this one stuck out to me called Blue Cough.

00:30.562 --> 00:33.241
So I got it. I got a popcorn container,

00:33.242 --> 00:34.481
I got some candy,

00:34.482 --> 00:37.161
and we sat down and watched it after the kids went to sleep.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.861
It was about an MT

00:38.880 --> 00:42.320
who became haunted and had all these weird experiences.

00:42.321 --> 00:43.641
It was really hard to follow.

00:43.642 --> 00:45.301
It was really cheesy.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.480
It was not a good movie.

00:46.481 --> 00:47.321
But it was a really,

00:47.322 --> 00:48.206
really fun date night.
