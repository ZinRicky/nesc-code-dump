WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
If there's one thing about me is that I'm a hopeless romantic.

00:03.401 --> 00:06.361
So weddings always make me ball my eyes out.

00:06.362 --> 00:09.601
Especially since my sister Daisy got married today.

00:09.602 --> 00:11.721
We got everyone up at 4:00am

00:11.722 --> 00:14.601
since we wanted to catch sunrise on the salt flats.

00:14.602 --> 00:16.521
And it was the most magical thing.

00:16.522 --> 00:18.161
The wedding was beautiful.

00:18.162 --> 00:20.401
There was no phones allowed during the ceremony,

00:20.402 --> 00:22.361
which made it so much more special.

00:22.362 --> 00:26.621
Seeing all the Smith siblings together always makes me so happy.

00:26.640 --> 00:30.240
I feel so grateful that I got to witness something so beautiful

00:30.241 --> 00:34.041
and heavenly. Makes me wanna plan a whole vow renewal.

00:34.042 --> 00:37.941
There's something so beautiful about choosing a life partner.
