00:00.000 --> 00:01.840
In a surprising turn of events,

00:01.841 --> 00:03.281
women and minority voters

00:03.282 --> 00:05.721
are actually the reason why Trump got re elected.

00:05.722 --> 00:06.761
Just where it stands right now,

00:06.762 --> 00:10.441
it looks like he gained about 5% point among African American voters,

00:10.442 --> 00:12.361
especially among African American men,

00:12.362 --> 00:14.741
and about 7% with Hispanic voters.

00:14.880 --> 00:18.040
Then we heard so much talk about how suburban women. Hi,

00:18.041 --> 00:21.241
we're going to be overwhelmingly in support of Harris.

00:21.242 --> 00:22.961
The reporters covering the election

00:22.962 --> 00:25.721
were surprised to find that Trump outperformed

00:25.722 --> 00:28.561
well beyond anyone's expectations with suburban women.

00:28.562 --> 00:33.021
These numbers seem to highlight a movement away from identity politics.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.280
Women and minority voters are sick of being told, hey,

00:36.281 --> 00:38.461
you're a woman, you have to side with us.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.840
You're African American, you must side with us.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.721
It's getting old. And instead,

00:42.722 --> 00:44.921
people are really starting to look at the policies,

00:44.922 --> 00:48.201
starting to realize how phony the left has been

00:48.202 --> 00:49.521
about trying to win women

00:49.522 --> 00:50.681
and trying to win minorities.

00:50.682 --> 00:52.801
All of the like, women supporting women,

00:52.802 --> 00:56.041
and you're not black if you don't vote for this person.

00:56.042 --> 00:57.561
People are getting sick and tired of that.

00:57.562 --> 01:00.521
It is demeaning. Women are more than just their gender.

01:00.522 --> 01:02.801
Minorities are more than just their ethnicity.

01:02.802 --> 01:04.561
We have brains, we know how to read.

01:04.562 --> 01:05.841
We care about policy

01:05.842 --> 01:08.481
more than we care about fitting into some kind of club.

01:08.482 --> 01:10.201
That is becoming more and more evident

01:10.202 --> 01:12.481
as we're seeing these election results come out.

01:12.482 --> 01:14.961
A lot of celebrities and politicians on the left

01:14.962 --> 01:17.561
think that They own these demographics of people.

01:17.562 --> 01:19.881
They think that we need to be loyal to them,

01:19.882 --> 01:22.641
get their rhetoric and their policies hurt us.

01:22.642 --> 01:25.121
And so many people are starting to realize that.

01:25.122 --> 01:27.941
And that is why you saw Trump victory.
