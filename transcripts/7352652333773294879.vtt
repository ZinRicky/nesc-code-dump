00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.560
it's really frustrating to care about the conversation of sustainability

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:04.761
when existing in inherently capitalist society

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:06.281
that does not care about the environment

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:08.041
constantly like at odds at my

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:10.741
you know desire to support the earth and you know

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.360
understanding of

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:14.001
you know climate changing global warming and all that

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.681
and also fatigue from existing in society

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:21.381
knowing that none of the actions that I take will actually matter because of

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.320
not joking maybe like 100 people

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:24.641
like for the rest of my life

00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:27.481
I will be subjected to straws that disintegrate in my mouth

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:31.521
and that will still not outweigh the negative impact of a 30 minute flight

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:32.561
that Taylor Swift takes

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:34.041
from one end of a state to another

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:34.561
and so it just

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:36.521
it's it’s it’s frustrating and I'm like

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:37.241
why does it matter

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:38.281
I can do all the things

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:39.641
I can do all the things that

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:42.041
you know help the environment and I'm not gonna not do

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.501
but it just feels so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.760
and it just makes it hard for me to

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:47.641
care about conversations about sustainability

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:48.881
because we're just

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:49.881
we're we're doing

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:53.401
minute change when we need to get to the root of the issue and I just

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:56.521
I just I just feel this doomerism when it comes to sustainability

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:59.041
and the conversation about that like literally makes me feel like a boomer

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:02.041
but I honestly don't know how to reckon with that either

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:02.911
I don't know anyways
