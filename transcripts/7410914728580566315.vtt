00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.980
True. After while I got engaged.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.120
And to say that I'm proud is an understatement.

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:09.241
Now, I'm not proud because she got a man to put a ring on it.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:12.601
I'm proud because she's gonna have a good marriage,

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:13.881
because she's gonna walk the walk.

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:18.741
Because she found a guy who treats her like a human fucking being

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.700
and a princess. Cause that's important, too.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.120
You see, when I talk about my happy marriage on here,

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:25.761
it's because I fucking locked into it.

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:29.181
It was a gift of cosmic proportions,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.360
meeting the man that I married to.

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:35.081
I didn't have a big sister bestie like drew to tell me what, like,

00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:39.121
a healthy man looks like or what green flags were,

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:43.161
or better yet, what red flags I should be watching out for. Were.

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:45.481
I was being raised by, like,

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:49.641
the early 2 ROM coms. I was raised with the,

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:50.721
if he's being mean to you,

00:00:50.722 --> 00:00:52.161
he just likes you. So

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:53.881
I am so fucking proud

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:57.121
that drew is going to usher into this next generation of women,

00:00:57.122 --> 00:00:59.321
which she already has as a single woman,

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:03.461
as a dating woman, and now soon to be as a married woman,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.600
what a healthy relationship with yourself

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.601
and therefore your partner looks like.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:11.161
She is going to be the big sister

00:01:11.162 --> 00:01:13.861
to usher in a next generation of women

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.720
to know what the blueprint is supposed to look like.

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.721
And she has a platform big enough to do it.

00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:19.641
I have always Said,

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:23.601
my measure of marriage success is not in the years that I married.

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:27.961
And the success of a relationship isn't whether or not you get engaged.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:30.881
A ring on a finger means absolutely nothing

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:35.281
if there's no symbolism of partnership behind it.

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:38.201
A ring is just a ring. A ring,

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:40.801
a marriage is not a guarantee of commitment,

00:01:40.802 --> 00:01:42.481
not a guarantee of happiness,

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:46.501
not a guarantee of compatibility and longevity in a relationship.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.100
It's what the ring represents,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.100
and I think drew got it right.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.100
Congratulations to the happy couple.
