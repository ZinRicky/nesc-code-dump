00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.241
the two questions I reckon

00:00:01.242 --> 00:00:02.320
 I get asked the most are

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:04.120
what are my favourite cleaning appliances

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:05.960
and do I have a Kärcher discount code

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:08.240
so I'm gonna show you 4 tools I can't live without

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.600
and I don't exactly have a code

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.400
but I do have a really good PSA

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:13.760
cause Kärcher’s Black Friday sale is on now

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:16.520
and you can score up to 50% off some of my favourites

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:18.080
okay so coming in at No. 1

00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:19.520
and I feel like everybody knows this

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.040
but it's my Kärcher Steam Cleaner

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:22.880
it comes with so many different attachments

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:24.880
so you can basically tackle any area

00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:28.840
and it kills up to 99.99% of bacteria just using steam

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:32.480
coming in at No. 2 is my Hard Floor Cleaner or as I prefer to call her

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:33.512
the Sweepy Moppy Thingy

00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:34.680
 I use it every single day

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.400
it sweeps and mops at the same time

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.485
and the way that it just glides across the 

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:40.280
floor is so effortless and satisfying

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:41.960
spot No. 3 was hotly contested

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:44.120
but if I have to choose it's gotta be the Water Blaster

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:46.880
if you watch my CleanToks you'll see I use this thing all the time

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.240
and I'm always genuinely surprised at how much I love it

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:50.200
and if my husband had a vote

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:52.760
he would definitely pop the Kärcher Wet & Dry vacuum in here

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.840
cause it's just fantastic for renovations

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:56.000
but he doesn't have a vote

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:57.700
so I'm picking the Window Vac system 

00:00:57.701 --> 00:00:59.400
because it's just perfect for windows

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:01.480
mirrors shower glass and condensation

00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:03.000
if you live in an older home like me

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.217
a couple of my personal life philosophies are 

00:01:05.218 --> 00:01:06.760
never buy anything at full price

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:08.480
and if you have the right tool for the job

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:09.227
the job is easier 

00:01:09.228 --> 00:01:10.804
if you wanna make cleaning easier for 

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:11.760
yourself or a loved one

00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:13.704
check out the sale cause the tools are great 

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:15.000
and the savings are impressive

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:16.840
and if you're keen to get clean by Christmas

00:01:16.841 --> 00:01:19.060
I'll pop a link where you'd expect to find it
