00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.650
One thing I've never understood is why people 

00:00:02.651 --> 00:00:04.439
are so quick to put you in a box

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.081
The idea that

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:07.161
You can't be (this) but also be (that)

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:09.441
You can’t be a Christian and also swear

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.961
You can't be loud but also enjoy the quiet

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:15.461
You can't be a stay at home housewife and also be educated

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.960
You can't be a good man but also have your vices

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:21.201
you can't put yourself out there but also like your privacy

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:22.672
The year is 2024 

00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:25.854
You can be (this) while also being (that) 

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:27.521
We’re not in the 50s anymore

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:29.786
You don't have to agree with someone 

00:00:29.787 --> 00:00:31.929
to also respect them as a person
