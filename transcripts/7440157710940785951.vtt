00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
Ahem. In the most ancient human societies,

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:11.281
people probably did not yet possess the conscious understanding

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:15.181
of the relationship of sex to reproduction.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.360
Thus, the concepts of paternity and fatherhood

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.261
would not yet have been understood,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.820
though probably accompanied by various mythical explanations.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.380
Babies were simply born from women.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.460
At one point we were revered as gods among men.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.300
Just saying.
