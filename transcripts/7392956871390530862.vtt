00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.680
So with all the rising costs of meat,

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:04.321
I decided that we're gonna raise our own meat birds this year.

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:05.841
Although we have raised chickens for years,

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:08.801
this is the first time we've been raising chickens just to eat them,

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:12.081
which is a weird process, because normally I'm so upset when they die

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:13.721
because they're my little egg layers.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:16.601
But this time, they're specifically purchased to raise,

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.841
so it's the same. They arrived,

00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:20.161
they were just these cute little fluff balls,

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:21.441
but they grew really fast.

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:23.281
I did get some egg layers at the same time,

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:26.061
and you can see the rapid growth compared to the egg layers.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.080
These birds are designed specifically to grow meat.

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:30.321
These are Freedom rangers.

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:32.801
They do grow slower than the Cornish cross.

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:33.921
They grow really, really fast.

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:35.481
These are like a medium speed,

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:37.561
I would say. They have less disease,

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:40.381
and they grow at a nice pace,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.160
but they still grow really fast.

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:43.761
Butcher day couldn't come soon enough.

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:46.281
They. They were eating everything within sight.

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:47.681
Our chickens don't normally eat that much.

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:49.701
They have a little bit of grain left over from the cow,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.360
and they eat all the bugs on pasture.

00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:53.561
But with these chickens, they were eating every bug inside,

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:54.681
and there was no food left.

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:56.221
So they were eating a lot of grain,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.560
and they were putting a lot of pressure on the other chickens

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:00.601
that we already have. Also the poop.

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.161
They. We have 17 acres,

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.521
but they love To hang out by the house.

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:05.181
So they were pooping on a lot of stuff,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.400
so it was definitely time.

00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:08.201
We could have butchered A few weeks before this,

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.821
so we just didn't have the time to do it.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.600
We end up purchasing this plucker,

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.601
because I'm probably gonna do this again in the future,

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:14.841
but I won't buy as many birds,

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.981
because this was a lot of birds disorder.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.800
We still have half of them out there on the pasture,

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:20.081
and we don't have the freezer space.

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:21.341
I'm gonna get a new freezer.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.120
It was a great learning experience for the kids,

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:25.421
and I would definitely recommend to try this out for yourselves.
