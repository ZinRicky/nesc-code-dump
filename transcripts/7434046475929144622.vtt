00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
One of the things I do to save money so I can stay home with my babies

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:04.921
is make my own laundry detergent.

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:06.941
Stay to the end to screenshot my recipe.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.600
I start with arm and hammer baking soda,

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.641
which we buy in bulk. Washing soda,

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:12.661
which has been used in laundry for a century.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.360
You do wanna be careful with this if you have cloth diapers,

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.881
but I strip mine at the end of every couple months.

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:18.601
But I promise you,

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:22.241
as the mom of two and a wife of a very dirty farmer husband,

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:24.341
it gets out all the stains you need it to.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.660
This was a three dollar bag of Epsom salt from Amazon.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.860
And yes, you can also add it into your bathtub.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.340
Mixing it is very therapeutic.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.940
Any type of natural sea salt,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.600
and if you would like it scented,

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:43.881
my favorite is the Citrus Twist from doterra.

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:46.321
I'm sure Young Living has their same twist, huh?

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:48.681
Unintended on an oil that you can use.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.161
I add 25 drops because I like it smelling good.

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:52.581
Well, my husband does.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.520
Mix, mix,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.340
because that's my favorite part.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.640
Most importantly to note here,

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:57.721
these are natural oils

00:00:57.722 --> 00:01:00.801
and it protects all the endocrine systems of my family,

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:03.801
which means I am protecting their future offspring.

00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:04.441
Yes, guys,

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:06.021
I am talking about your swimmers.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.160
It's very concentrated

00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:09.861
and you only need a tablespoon to 2 tablespoons per load.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.820
This is an easy way to save money.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.033
Screenshot the recipe and double if you like.
