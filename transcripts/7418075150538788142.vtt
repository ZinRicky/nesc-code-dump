00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.340
Let's talk about stay at home moms or stay at home wives.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.320
Being a stay at home mom is absolutely

00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:08.641
the most difficult thing I've ever done.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.281
I don't think we should be undermining it

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:13.041
by saying that it's easier than working a 9 to 5

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.881
or that your life is gonna be magically easier

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.001
because you quit your job

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.321
and you did the honorable thing of staying home with your kids

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.061
if you could financially.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.360
Everybody on social media wants to paint this picture

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.801
that it's just so easy and amazing and fulfilling

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:27.861
staying home all the time.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.000
The problem with that is it's not true.

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.561
And here's why. And no,

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.381
men are not to blame for this.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.080
We were meant to be in a village.

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:38.521
The reason there's so many reels of women having freakouts

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:40.921
and waiting for their husband to come home from work

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:44.241
is because we were never meant to be alone and isolated

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:46.801
raising children. People back then lived in villages.

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:48.081
They lived on family compounds.

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:50.001
You had your abuela or your grandma,

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.301
you had your aunts, you had your sisters.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.240
Fertile women would free bleed in a tent

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:56.721
while the post menopausal women would take care of them

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.801
and watch the kids. When a new mom had a baby,

00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:02.121
she was really meant just to nurse that baby

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:05.741
and make sure it had the best foundation at its earliest years.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.600
While sister, mom,

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.641
aunt, cousins

00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:10.281
and other people in the Village

00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:13.601
Slash family would Help raise all the other kids,

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:15.601
they would help clean, they would help cook.

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:19.781
And now stay at home moms are frowned upon if they even hire a maid.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.960
You hear comments like, oh, whatever,

00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:23.501
it's because she has a maid.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.440
A maid is probably the smallest thing

00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.521
that could help a stay at home mom.

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:30.441
When I worked in corporate life and I had my taxes,

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:33.041
I hired a CPA. If you needed marketing done,

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:34.921
you hired a social media expert.

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:36.721
If you needed administrative assistance,

00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:38.221
you hired a secretary.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.700
But people are going to rag on a stay at home mom that has a maid.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.760
You already know I am like an anti feminist. Okay?

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:49.681
On the other side, we don't need men and women looking at these reels

00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:51.441
and videos of these moms saying,

00:01:51.442 --> 00:01:52.921
I am lonely, I am isolated,

00:01:52.922 --> 00:01:54.481
or I can't wait for my husband to come home

00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:55.681
or he needs to help.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:59.161
They shouldn't be looking down on them because the truth is,

00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:03.461
there is so much overwhelming work to do in the home.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.840
Now, do I think it is a man's job to be a side mom

00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:10.501
when he comes home from work?

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.600
No, I don't.

00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:13.001
I think it's a cultural thing.

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:16.001
I think it was never. I think they were meant to work,

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.581
they were meant to hunt, they were meant to go to war,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.280
and women would stay here and get help from other women.

00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:24.641
I think we should be having Our moms coming over,

00:02:24.642 --> 00:02:25.721
our aunts, our cousins,

00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:29.521
our nieces, and everybody should have a hand in raising the children

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:32.721
while dad is at work. And we cannot blame men for this.

00:02:32.722 --> 00:02:33.921
Women all the time are like, oh,

00:02:33.922 --> 00:02:36.121
he gets to escape to an 8 to 5 job,

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.161
and then he comes home and he wants to rest.

00:02:38.162 --> 00:02:40.361
And I'm still working a 24 hour job.

00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:42.601
You are, and I completely agree with that.

00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:45.561
It's freaking hard. But this is a cultural issue.

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:48.201
This is why I've always liked the Latin cultures and the Hispanics,

00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:50.961
because they kept their family units together.

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:52.161
I live on the southern border

00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:53.121
and this is the truth

00:02:53.122 --> 00:02:56.081
of a little 19 Mexican year old girl gets pregnant,

00:02:56.082 --> 00:02:58.841
guess what? It doesn't matter because she will stay home.

00:02:58.842 --> 00:03:00.121
Her abuela, her tias,

00:03:00.122 --> 00:03:01.281
her cuz, her primos,

00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:05.061
they will all freaking help her raise those babies or that baby.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.360
And they keep their family unit as a village.

00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:10.761
And I have a ton of friends who are Hispanic

00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:12.401
who had their children a very young,

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:14.281
in their 20s, and it wasn't frowned upon,

00:03:14.282 --> 00:03:17.561
nobody freaked out, nobody talked about getting rid of them.

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:20.321
They're not as isolated. It can be done.

00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:23.201
And there's not this fear factor around having babies,

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.801
especially young, which that's a whole

00:03:25.802 --> 00:03:29.441
another cultural aspect about our white American culture

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:33.161
of having babies and how we get so scared if we get pregnant young,

00:03:33.162 --> 00:03:35.381
which you already know. I'm an advocate

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.080
Advocate for having babies younger. Okay,

00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:39.361
that's my rant. I'm just.

00:03:39.362 --> 00:03:41.221
I'm so tired of, like,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.360
even on the side of the fence that most people are on with me,

00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:48.401
they see these reels, and they have these comments of these women, like,

00:03:48.402 --> 00:03:51.161
leaving their children with their husband the minute 5:00 happens.

00:03:51.162 --> 00:03:55.861
Yes, it's because she is taking on the job of 20 different people.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.920
But again, it is a cultural thing.

00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:02.761
It is not to. We are not to place that blame on men.

00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:06.201
It is our culture. And now I'm starting to see people change it.

00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:08.721
But I'm so glad people are starting to realize this.

00:04:08.722 --> 00:04:12.061
And now it's going viral on Instagram with, like, homesteaders.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.560
People are building family compound.

00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:15.841
You don't have to be in the same house,

00:04:15.842 --> 00:04:16.961
but they're building a village,

00:04:16.962 --> 00:04:20.731
having a farm. There's four houses on the property. That those are
