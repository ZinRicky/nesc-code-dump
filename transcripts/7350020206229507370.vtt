My husband's been on a real ice cream cake lately.

00:02.481 --> 00:03.641
We ran out of ice cream,

00:03.642 --> 00:06.441
so I decided to combine two of his favourite things,

00:06.442 --> 00:07.841
ice cream and cinnamon rolls,

00:07.842 --> 00:09.861
and make a cinnamon roll ice cream.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.080
Heated my milk mixture on the stove

00:12.081 --> 00:14.081
while I combined all of my egg yolks

00:14.082 --> 00:18.201
and gave that a good whisk before pouring in some of that hot milk.

00:18.202 --> 00:20.601
Then I transfer all of that back to the stove

00:20.602 --> 00:22.121
and let it thicken a little bit

00:22.122 --> 00:25.461
before adding it to a bowl with some heavy cream.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.760
Make sure to strain it just to get all the bits out.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.241
I added some vanilla and some more cinnamon

00:30.242 --> 00:32.401
before covering it with cling film

00:32.402 --> 00:34.721
and setting it in the fridge for a few hours.

00:34.722 --> 00:37.961
In the meantime, I made my cinnamon roll dough with some butter,

00:37.962 --> 00:40.881
some sugar, use some whole wheat flour,

00:40.882 --> 00:44.281
a little bit of milk, and obviously some more cinnamon.

00:44.282 --> 00:47.761
I let that go until it all came together in a cohesive dough

00:47.762 --> 00:50.281
before transferring it over to a bowl.

00:50.282 --> 00:53.781
I place this in the fridge until my mixture was cool.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.560
Right before churning my ice cream,

00:55.561 --> 00:57.161
I made a quick cinnamon swirl

00:57.162 --> 00:59.481
that I would drizzle on top of the ice cream.

00:59.482 --> 01:01.161
Once all of my ingredients were prepped,

01:01.162 --> 01:05.281
I turned on my ice cream Turner and poured in my ice cream mixture.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.401
I let that go until it thickened up

01:07.402 --> 01:09.661
before adding my cinnamon roll dough

01:09.720 --> 01:12.180
and letting that Go for another few minutes.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.920
Once it looked like soft serve,

01:13.921 --> 01:17.121
I transferred it over to my storage container.

01:17.122 --> 01:18.441
It needed a little bit more,

01:18.442 --> 01:20.881
so I drizzled it with my cinnamon swirl

01:20.882 --> 01:23.161
and some more of the dough that was left over,

01:23.162 --> 01:25.921
and then it was ready to go in the freezer for a few hours.

01:25.922 --> 01:28.881
By this time, both lucky and I couldn't wait any longer.

01:28.882 --> 01:32.441
So we had it. And it was so good that he stole that bowl,

01:32.442 --> 01:34.121
and I made myself another bowl.

01:34.122 --> 01:36.121
The different textures were so perfect,

01:36.122 --> 01:38.841
he actually ended up finishing that whole tray of ice cream.

01:38.842 --> 01:40.661
So I'm making a new batch.
