00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.300
I feel like such an asshole.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.820
My daughter has become a fucking crazy theater kid.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.680
Crazy theater kid. For her 14th birthday,

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.841
one of the gifts I got her was tickets to go see Hamilton.

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:18.521
And we just went the other night to go see Hamilton.

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:24.541
And while we were on our little mother daughter date to see Hamilton,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.240
she was talking about the musical at school

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.201
that she's gonna try out for,

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:29.121
and she's so excited for it.

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:29.521
And we were, like,

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:30.961
talking about her outfit and her song,

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:33.741
and it was like, the whole night was musical theater. Musical theater.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.520
She's with her dad for the next couple days,

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:44.941
so I mixed up the days of when her.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.380
I mix up the days of when her audition was.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.160
And I texted her this morning, like,

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:55.001
hey, honey,

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.201
you're gonna do great today.

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:58.081
You're gonna cook, you're gonna eat it up.

00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:00.301
Sending her gifts, hyping her up.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.600
She's like, mom,

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.661
trials for yesterday. And I didn't get a call back.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.920
Oh, my god,

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.661
I feel like such an asshole.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.700
I was like, oh,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.320
how are you feeling? And tried to, like,

00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:23.021
switch the conversation to just support her, but

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.140
I feel like such an asshole.
