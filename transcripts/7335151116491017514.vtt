00:00.240 --> 00:02.560
Let's get ready for the Tory Bird show.

00:02.560 --> 00:04.280
I had a fitting the night before

00:04.280 --> 00:07.000
to make sure that my outfit fit right.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.120
A few hours before my clown team got there,

00:09.120 --> 00:10.560
my outfit got delivered,

00:10.560 --> 00:12.640
and I laid everything out. And then

00:12.640 --> 00:14.920
this is where stuff started to get a little hectic.

00:14.920 --> 00:15.880
Everyone arrived.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.900
We got started on hair and makeup immediately.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.080
To me, is the most relaxing part.

00:21.080 --> 00:21.720
At this point,

00:21.720 --> 00:22.680
we were running late,

00:22.680 --> 00:24.480
so we needed to hurry

00:24.480 --> 00:26.360
and get all the finishing touches done.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.240
I got dressed

00:27.240 --> 00:30.040
and then needed to decide what earring to wear.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.200
I made the team vote,

00:31.200 --> 00:33.000
and everyone voted for the bigger ones,

00:33.000 --> 00:34.260
so that's what we went.

00:34.720 --> 00:38.020
Then we got downstairs and got into the car.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.800
I started cracking up when I saw my name

00:40.800 --> 00:42.480
flashing in the driver's window.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.080
Once we arrived at the show,

00:44.080 --> 00:45.880
we found our seats

00:45.880 --> 00:47.880
and the show was starting,

00:47.880 --> 00:50.580
so I'm glad we made it right on time.

00:50.840 --> 00:54.080
All the silhouettes and the fabrics were so beautiful.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.920
I loved all of the coats and the way they moved.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.040
I loved so many of the pieces,

00:59.040 --> 01:00.900
and I cannot wait

01:00.920 --> 01:02.520
have some of them in my closet.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.320
Especially that brown,

01:04.320 --> 01:05.360
sparkly coat.

01:05.360 --> 01:06.920
I can't stop thinking about it.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.280
And then after the show,

01:08.280 --> 01:10.760
I got to catch up with a lot of people

01:10.760 --> 01:12.680
I usually don't get to see.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.400
Since we were rushing in to get seated,

01:15.400 --> 01:17.000
we did all of the pictures

01:17.000 --> 01:18.640
and Interviews after the show

01:18.640 --> 01:20.342
and then it was time to head back to the hotel.
