00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
Having one of those, like,

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:04.961
what goes around comes around moments, and I am living for it.

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:06.641
Go watch her video because it's really funny.

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:08.441
But also I just wanted to add on, like,

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:09.241
a little bit of, like,

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.241
sociological context to what's happening.

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:15.121
So men forever have benefited from the system that men had set up,

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:16.881
which we know is the patriarchy.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.481
And if you don't believe that the patriarchy is, like,

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:20.121
a real thing, you can scroll on by.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:21.241
This video is not for you.

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:23.721
But those of us who have been trying to educate ourselves on feminist

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:24.921
principles and feminism,

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:26.021
as in general,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.520
recognize that patriarchy hurts men, too.

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:30.681
And this taps into things like ageism,

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:33.781
into body dysmorphia and, like, imagery.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.520
I actually saw a really great live yesterday from my sister,

00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:38.601
who's actually a cosplayer,

00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:40.201
and she was talking about men's mental health

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:42.521
and body image within the cosplay community.

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:44.721
And I myself am not in the cosplay community,

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:48.801
but I can absolutely be enthralled by a conversation about body image,

00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:50.681
because all of that is an offshoot of, like,

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:53.081
patriarchal and white supremacist beauty standards,

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:55.161
which for women, are extremely strict.

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:59.961
But there is also a male beauty standard as far as, like,

00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:03.581
physique, that has been created by men.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.360
And you can say all day long that, like,

00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:09.161
women have this idea of a male beauty standard.

00:01:09.162 --> 00:01:13.781
Absolutely. But there is a really interesting study that I saw

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.480
where men and women were Shown hyper feminine or hyper masculine

00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:19.521
photos of like,

00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:20.821
the same image.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.120
And men always were most attracted to the hyper feminine

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:25.361
version of a woman,

00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:28.001
whereas women were not necessarily

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.921
always attracted to the hyper masculine version of men

00:01:30.922 --> 00:01:31.921
because they saw it as, like,

00:01:31.922 --> 00:01:33.301
threatening and aggressive.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.480
They liked, like, a pull back,

00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:38.361
like, not fully all the way hyper masculine.

00:01:38.362 --> 00:01:40.661
And it kind of goes the same way with, like, attitude.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.000
That alpha male,

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.121
hyper masculine,

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:47.481
toxic red pill bullshit is no longer flying for women and men.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.961
Not all men. Cause people get mad when I, like,

00:01:49.962 --> 00:01:51.501
lump everyone all in together.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.320
Not all men, but the men who have completely bought into

00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:59.161
and ascribed to this patriarchal standard of what manhood is

00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:01.121
are the ones being hurt the most.

00:02:01.122 --> 00:02:04.401
And the only way it's ever gonna change is if men get on board

00:02:04.402 --> 00:02:07.281
and realize how much patriarchy hurts them too.

00:02:07.282 --> 00:02:09.841
Leaves them unable to talk about their feelings,

00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:12.161
unable to have true intimate relationships

00:02:12.162 --> 00:02:15.761
because they can't fully be intimate and vulnerable emotionally

00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:17.841
with either their friends or their partner,

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:20.601
and judge people based on their physical appearance,

00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:21.361
including themselves.

00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:24.201
So until the men get on board with dismantling the patriarchy,

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:27.241
they, they indeed are having a fuck around and find out moment.

00:02:27.242 --> 00:02:29.361
And I don't know how I feel about that, because, like,

00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:31.201
the petty in me wants to be happy about it,

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:34.081
but the, like, compassionate, empathetic,

00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:36.221
like a lover of good Men,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.400
lover of my husband,

00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:38.901
lover of my sons,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.400
wants better for them.

00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:45.561
So I just hope that this leads to a movement of men joining feminism.

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:47.561
Or maybe we need to rebrand it as just, like,

00:02:47.562 --> 00:02:49.161
literally just gender Equality,

00:02:49.162 --> 00:02:51.561
because the word feminism scares off a lot of people,

00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:53.081
which is annoying.

00:02:53.082 --> 00:02:55.801
But maybe then we need the men to join the movement,

00:02:55.802 --> 00:02:57.557
because this isn't good for y'all either.
