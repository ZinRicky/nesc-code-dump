00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.680
I got these markers from the TikTok shop,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.280
and I genuinely had no idea

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.600
how much my children were gonna love them.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.800
We sat here for hours colouring.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.960
They kinda just lived on my kitchen table

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.880
from that point on.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.280
And we all just kinda pick them up

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.340
and coloured pictures as we wanted.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.040
It was really beautiful.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.360
You could tell that they really,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.200
really felt loved and fulfilled.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.080
It was, like

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.120
the easiest way to spend really loving,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.480
quality time with my kids.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.000
And it's gonna be a regular in our house now.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.320
I absolutely love it.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.980
They're linked right here if you wanna buy a set.
