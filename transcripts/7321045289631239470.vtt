00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.160
I just woke up and I'm at my boyfriend's house

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:04.001
and he's asleep in the other room

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:06.021
but I wanna answer you

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.120
my relationship with my children changed after leaving my marriage

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:12.221
because I no longer had

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.500
like you say

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.040
this partner that I needed to tend to

00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:18.081
like whenever we got in an argument

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:18.961
and it was all the time

00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:20.481
it's this cycle of abuse

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:21.641
this toxic cycle

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:23.961
so you know we have the big blow up argument

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:26.441
and then it's gonna take days to sort that out

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:27.441
the feelings and everything

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:28.661
and in those days

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.720
I'm not really gonna be present with my children

00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:33.341
because I'm so distracted at the hurt and pain

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.400
and confusion of what's going on in my relationship

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:40.281
so you know I'm spending my days kind of pushing my kids away like hey

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:40.881
yeah yeah yeah

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:41.921
can you go do something else

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:42.441
can you do this

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:43.281
can you do that

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:44.241
cause I'm trying to like

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:45.361
hide from them

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:46.561
and so you know

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:48.001
I'm tryna hide my feelings from them

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:49.441
I'm tryna hide what's going on from them

00:00:49.442 --> 00:00:49.801
cause you know

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:50.921
you don't wanna fight in front of the kids

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:51.961
so there's just like

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:55.201
the whole relationship with the kids is very superficial

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:57.281
cause I'm hiding so much from them

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:58.701
so the minute I left

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.120
I had no choice but to be authentic and vulnerable in front of them

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:03.761
there was no longer anything to hide behind

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.021
I no longer had this

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.160
relationship that I was running behind closed doors to argue about

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:09.401
I now had to like

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.361
just be there and be present with my kids

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:13.501
and it fucking paid off

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.180
like I know when you're trying to hide arguing from the kids you kind of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.320
you also hide your emotions

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:19.401
cause you don't wanna be like

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:21.881
oh I'm crying cause Mommy and daddy got in an argument

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.181
so you're just like

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.480
you know constantly hiding and lying everything from your children

00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:30.801
so there's no way you're gonna have that deep of a relationship

00:01:30.802 --> 00:01:32.321
they can feel that

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:33.121
you know I don't

00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:33.721
I don't know

00:01:33.722 --> 00:01:35.461
you know and so

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.980
being able to be completely honest and vulnerable with my kids and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.000
you know they no longer could see me as this super mom

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.441
I was now a total human

00:01:47.442 --> 00:01:49.181
they could see me cry

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.480
they saw my weak moments

00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:52.481
they saw me when I'm like

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:53.441
I don't know

00:01:53.442 --> 00:01:55.001
I don't know what we're gonna do

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:56.481
but we're gonna figure it out

00:01:56.482 --> 00:02:01.821
so I think they have been able to see also how much I love them

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.160
to what links I will actually go to to support them

00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:07.201
to be there for them

00:02:07.202 --> 00:02:08.921
to give them not just what they need

00:02:08.922 --> 00:02:10.941
but make it happy and fun

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.640
so also like

00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:16.921
even the mundane moments in our house are no longer eggshell

00:02:16.922 --> 00:02:17.961
scattered all over the floor

00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:20.841
just our regular average shit in our house

00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:21.981
nothing special

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.380
just that is healing and nice

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.640
because we're not waiting for someone to come yell at us

00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:31.181
or tell us what we're doing wrong or you know so

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.240
yeah literally being in a shitty relationship

00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:38.821
is going to keep a separation between you and your children

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.900
and when you finally make the choice to leave and decide well

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.600
I have these children that really need me

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:47.221
and I'm gonna put them first and put myself first

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.440
the relationship is literally what I dreamed of

00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:53.141
so hope that helps
