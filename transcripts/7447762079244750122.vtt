00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.920
ladies it is okay if you do not love keeping house

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:06.160
let me explain I never post in the morning

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:08.920
so I was gonna just do a little live update

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:10.480
just made my mushroom coffee

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:14.020
it's to die for I put butter and raw milk in it thank me later

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.440
anyway I don't think a woman has to love keeping her

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.880
my husband and I have gotten an argument about this before

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:25.240
I am one of those that likes to clean it one or two times

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.440
head to toe and then yes

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.640
you have to try to maintain it

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.520
but the things that I don't love is like

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:34.320
the two things of dishes I do every single day

00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.540
the load of laundry I do every single day

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.760
the piling up of clean clothes

00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:41.240
cause I absolutely abhor putting up clean clothes

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.980
I can wash laundry all day long

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.860
but I know everyone agrees with me that putting them up is just

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.660
it should be illegal hi honey I need you to stop

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.240
okay

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.340
so he growls now like an animal you're an animal

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.500
hi baby

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.380
what you doing

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.420
are you waking up

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.720
waking up

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:15.600
my 3 major absolutely terrifies me sometimes cause he can be a little mean

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:16.280
no mommy

00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:18.120
close the door no

00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.420
it's me daddy's working

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.220
do dishes

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.700
who feeds you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.980
okay thank you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.440
you're welcome no

00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:38.780
let's go see baby brother

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.340
for the life of me I don't know why people are so scared of raw milk

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.020
like it logically doesn't even make sense if you eat anything about it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.660
okay no a word

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.900
listen to him

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.300
oh my god honestly

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.120
if my landlords were smart

00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:01.780
we would need a pet deposit for both of them

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.960
it's the constant cleaning of the playroom and the mat

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.020
everyday I clean it

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.860
and then 10 minutes later it looks like a bomb went off again

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.320
and it's frustrating and you have to remember that you live in a lived in home

00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:24.260
it would be different if you're dropping your kids off at school or daycare

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.740
or you're out of the house shopping and the house doesn't get touched

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.260
I have to explain that sometimes to my husband

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.840
you're getting crazy and y'all know what I mean

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:35.820
you have to explain that like listen

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.760
an hour ago if you would come home

00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:40.200
it was spotless but we lived in it since then

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:41.680
so now it doesn't look spotless

00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:44.240
and that's okay because we need to start practicing

00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:46.460
moms that maybe don't have a spotless house all the time

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.160
but are not burnt out and depressed and overwhelmed

00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:52.400
I wish more than anything that I could show my kids
