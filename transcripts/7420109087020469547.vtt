00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.720
I had to calm myself down several times to make a response video

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:05.720
because I kept commenting back to this person and um

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:07.680
they kept getting taken down for bullying

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:11.440
so first thing I wanna point out is the sheer inappropriateness of this comment

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:14.440
to be left on that video shows a lack of tact

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:17.240
a lack of class a lack of compassion and empathy

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:19.880
also and this is the part that's really frustrating

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:22.540
it shows just how willfully um

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.920
you are misunderstanding any of my Tradwife content

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:28.940
there's a very big difference between a Tradwife and a prepper

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.840
being so willfully misunderstood

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.680
I made me so angry

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:37.240
mostly because you used the death and destruction of Western North Carolina

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:40.380
and my concern for it to make this comment

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.640
but beyond that if you are not sophisticated enough

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:46.760
to understand the nuance of a complex conversation

00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:51.120
shut your mouth you don't have the skills to participate in this discussion

00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:54.520
clearly my critique of trad wife content creators

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:58.400
has nothing to do with what's going on in Western North Carolina

00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:02.460
but beyond that do you know that there are non trad wife preppers

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.000
do you know that you can make homesteading content

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.740
without a sprinkle of white supremacist rhetoric

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.620
would it shock you to know that I also grow vegetables and can bake bread

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.040
yeah because these topics aren't black and white

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:20.060
they have nuance and your capacity to understand that is your problem

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.820
people who are educated and sophisticated enough to have this conversation

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.560
understand what I'm talking about

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:29.060
and you should have the day that you deserve

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.454
and I kind of hope you pee your pants in public today
