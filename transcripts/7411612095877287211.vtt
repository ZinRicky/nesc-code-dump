00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
I just got home from the gym,

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.601
and I'm hiding in my office

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:05.041
because I don't want my kids to hear what I'm about to talk about.

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:07.361
We have a massive problem in this country,

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:11.541
and I can't believe I'm on here talking about another school shooting

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.060
literally three weeks into the school year.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.640
But we have another young boy who had access to guns,

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:23.001
who was gifted a gun by his parents,

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.361
who already had made threats against a school,

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:27.661
who had already shown aggressive behavior,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.520
who actually followed through with his threats.

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:33.921
I've been following Mom's demand action for years,

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:37.281
and this happens more than it makes national news.

00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:40.941
It happens all the fucking time.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.440
And everyone who is pro gun,

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:45.041
and I'm not gonna say pro second Amendment,

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.681
because there are responsible gun owners,

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:50.241
people who are just pro gun without any registration,

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:54.581
any background checks, any sort of incumbencies to owning a weapon.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.400
Those people constantly say that it's not a gun issue,

00:00:57.401 --> 00:00:58.681
it's a mental health issue.

00:00:58.682 --> 00:01:00.001
It's a people issue. Okay,

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:03.161
then what the fuck are we doing for our boys?

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:04.581
What are we doing for our sons?

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920
Our white sons? What are we doing for them?

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.581
What are we doing for our schools?

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.800
Used to be super against, like,

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.481
metal detectors and SROs, but now it seems like,

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:16.321
almost insane that we don't have those,

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:19.161
because we refuse to do anything about the core problem,

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:23.921
and we refuse to do anything other than Like gun drills for our kids

00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:26.561
and. And this just keeps happening.

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:29.041
And the people who are super pro gun

00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:32.121
are exactly the type of people who are gonna turn to their boys

00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:33.561
and tell them to suck it up

00:01:33.562 --> 00:01:36.061
and stop being a sissy and act like a man.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.600
And we're shocked. And we're shocked we have an aggression issue.

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:42.041
We don't let boys feel feelings.

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:44.361
We give them first person shooter games,

00:01:44.362 --> 00:01:48.181
we give them rifles as 14 year old holiday presents.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.560
And then we're shocked when these emotionally unintelligent,

00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:58.441
emotionally under developed boys with an entitlement complex

00:01:58.442 --> 00:02:00.241
because they're white boys,

00:02:00.242 --> 00:02:02.841
white men, they should be getting everything on a fucking platter.

00:02:02.842 --> 00:02:05.141
And when life doesn't go their way,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.820
who are they gonna blame? Their classmates?

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.560
Their mean teachers? The girls who laugh at them?

00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:13.661
And that's who gets their violence.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.420
That's who gets their violence.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.380
This issue is bigger than guns,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.300
but that's one of the major issues.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.120
And if we don't address any of the major issues

00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:27.721
contributing to the epidemic of gun violence in our schools,

00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:30.881
then we are literally wiping our hands up the problem

00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:33.061
and saying thoughts and prayers.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.560
And I don't know about you,

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:36.321
but I'm fucking sick of thoughts and prayers.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.861
They haven't changed a fucking thing.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.080
Not one thing. They haven't comforted one family,

00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:45.101
they haven't prevented one shooting. None.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.100
Zero, zero percent success rate with thoughts and prayers.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.720
Maybe it's time to start talking about comprehensive mental health.

00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:55.541
Talk about breaking the cycle of toxic

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.800
masculine suppression of feelings.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.720
talk about the impact of isolation and first person shooter games.

00:03:02.721 --> 00:03:08.381
You know, changing what we're doing with these boys.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.120
Isn't it worth trying? Isn't it worth just trying something different?

00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:15.521
It is insanity to watch this happen over and over again

00:03:15.522 --> 00:03:19.821
and do absolutely fuck all to address any of the underlying issues.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.000
Insanity.
