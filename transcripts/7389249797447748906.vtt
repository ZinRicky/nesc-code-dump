00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.480
So the family and I are going to the lake today.

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:04.261
I've got my little, like,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.760
cute little, honestly,

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:07.301
like, dirty dancing outfit.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.520
Um, but I wanted to try a new lip combo

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:12.001
because I've been seeing the Sabrina Carpenter lip everywhere,

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:13.281
and I think it's really pretty,

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:17.001
and I wanna try it out. So I'm using some NYX products.

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:18.801
NYX products. Forgot to put blush on.

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.041
I'm using my merit beauty.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:21.481
It's amazing. Okay,

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:24.141
so this is the NYX line. Loud in Global Citizen,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.260
just right there.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.660
And Cupid's bow.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.340
I just wanna blend it a little.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.780
And this is the NYX Butter gloss in creme brulee.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.740
Oh, that's really pretty.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.360
Now, I know the light in here is shit,

00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:51.921
but if you're looking for, like,

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:54.381
a nude glossy lip, this is great.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.580
There's some better lighting. What do we think?
