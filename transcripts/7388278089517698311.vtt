00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.920
if you haven't already met my best friend

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:02.960
this is Goldie

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.171
she's an almost three year old Hungarian Vizsla

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:06.600
with a little bit of GSP in her

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:09.320
but it feels like just yesterday she was our new baby

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:11.520
so much has changed but also nothing has changed

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:14.400
she's still the exact same personality she was when we met her

00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:16.560
Goldie loves to swim, she loves to dig holes

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:19.520
although fortunately for me she's grown out of digging up my garden

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.880
and I think her favourite thing in the world to do is run

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm also fairly confident

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.563
she subscribes to that philosophy of 

00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:26.000
“never let them know your next move”

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.560
then our baby turned into a teenager and before I knew it she was all grown up

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:31.440
I'm sure everybody says this about their pup

00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:33.320
but Goldie has a heart of pure gold

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:36.600
she's an absolute sweetheart and she doesn't have a bad bone in her body

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:38.000
she's grown up with my three children

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.280
so naturally she thinks she might also be one

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:41.880
and we don't have the heart to tell her any different

00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:43.960
so Vizsla’s are an interesting breed actually

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.320
they come from a hunting background

00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:47.560
so she loves to sniff point and retrieve

00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:49.760
and apparently they're the fifth fastest dog in the world

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:50.647
and I would believe it 

00:00:50.648 --> 00:00:51.920
they're a super social breed

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:54.400
she's always making friends with other dogs at the park

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:55.520
and she really loves people

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:59.280
wishes have reputation of being Velcro dogs and I can confirm it's true

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.520
and if you wanna make her smile

00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:01.608
just give her a cuddle 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.880
Goldie gives us her whole heart every single day

00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:05.960
and we just wanna give her the best life that we can

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:06.600
and obviously

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.560
choosing the right pet food is super important for her overall health

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:11.600
and wellbeing both now and in the future

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.080
and I love Hill’s Pet Nutrition 

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:14.520
because it's clinically formulated

00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:16.720
to deliver the most nutritional benefit for her

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.760
and she loves Hill’s because it tastes good

00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:20.480
and I know it's good cause when I feed it to her

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:21.920
she stops and thanks me

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:23.400
Also she can be kind of fussy with her food

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.160
but she genuinely really likes Hill’s

00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:26.120
and by feeding her Hill’s

00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:27.120
I know she'll be healthier

00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:28.414
stronger and live longer 

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:30.174
so we can cuddle for years to come
