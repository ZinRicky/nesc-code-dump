00:00.040 --> 00:03.160
Here's everything I eat in a day two months postpartum.

00:03.161 --> 00:05.241
And as someone that loves to cook,

00:05.242 --> 00:08.081
I always start my day off with a hot cup of tea

00:08.082 --> 00:09.321
and some flavored water.

00:09.322 --> 00:12.301
I also make sure to always take my vitamins.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.040
To go with my cassava waffles,

00:14.041 --> 00:18.221
I made a quick peach puree and then got started on my waffle batter.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.760
Since my eczema is flaring up,

00:19.761 --> 00:22.561
I'm trying to reduce how much gluten I have in a day,

00:22.562 --> 00:24.801
so I always tend to have these.

00:24.802 --> 00:27.441
Then I blended up the peaches we cooked earlier,

00:27.442 --> 00:30.381
spread that on my waffle alongside some strawberries.

00:30.520 --> 00:31.960
As a quick snack before lunch,

00:31.961 --> 00:35.361
I cut up some mango oranges with a squeeze of lime.

00:35.362 --> 00:37.561
I always have to have my midday beverage.

00:37.562 --> 00:41.941
Today was an orange Poppy, and then I moved on to making some lunch.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.680
I combined all of my ingredients for my dough,

00:48.681 --> 00:50.001
kneaded until smooth,

00:50.002 --> 00:52.361
and then let that rise for two hours.

00:52.362 --> 00:53.481
Form those into balls,

00:53.482 --> 00:57.221
and let them rest for another 30 minutes while I made my topping.

00:57.320 --> 00:58.440
Cut up some onions,

00:58.441 --> 01:00.001
bell peppers, parsley,

01:00.002 --> 01:02.961
some tomatoes, and combine that in a food processor.

01:02.962 --> 01:07.121
I then mixed in some lamb and beef alongside some other seasoning

01:07.122 --> 01:09.461
before spreading that onto my dough.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.240
I baked that until it was crispy,

01:11.241 --> 01:13.521
topped it with some fresh herbs, tomato,

01:13.522 --> 01:14.681
onion, a squeeze of lemon,

01:14.682 --> 01:16.361
and you can't forget the sumac.

01:16.362 --> 01:18.801
This was exactly what I wanted for dinner.

01:18.802 --> 01:20.841
I wanted something Quick and easy.

01:20.842 --> 01:22.641
So a roast chicken it was.

01:22.642 --> 01:25.321
Spatchcocked my chicken topped it with some olive oil,

01:25.322 --> 01:26.081
salt, pepper,

01:26.082 --> 01:29.041
butter before washing my fingerling potatoes,

01:29.042 --> 01:30.321
cutting them in half,

01:30.322 --> 01:32.441
four and quarters depending on how big they were,

01:32.442 --> 01:35.881
and then I added my potatoes and carrots to my baking dish.

01:35.882 --> 01:38.561
I moved on to making a tarragon cream sauce

01:38.562 --> 01:40.201
I spread all over my chicken

01:40.202 --> 01:43.281
and also added some white wine to my baking tray

01:43.282 --> 01:45.761
before popping it in till it was done.

01:45.762 --> 01:48.081
This was probably my favourite meal of today.

01:48.082 --> 01:50.561
I don't think you can go wrong with a roast chicken.

01:50.562 --> 01:53.301
Before I went to bed I had a bowl of kettle corn.
