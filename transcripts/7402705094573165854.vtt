00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.120
I'm gonna be real with y'all.

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:02.481
Today did not go as planned.

00:00:02.482 --> 00:00:03.841
We are all kinda just in a mood.

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:05.001
We have a lot going on with the house,

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.761
and I think the kids are starting to feed off of Logan.

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:08.401
And I stress they're picking on each other,

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:10.961
not listening, and just not motivated to do their school work.

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:11.681
Now, I get it.

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:13.721
I have off days, and it's only fair that they do, too.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.121
We did poetry, our read aloud,

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:17.961
and our geography, and then I sent them to the room for some alone time.

00:00:17.962 --> 00:00:20.561
After their quiet time, they did come back and get some math seeds done,

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.121
so I feel a little bit better about the day,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.601
but overall, it just feels like a wash.

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:25.481
Normally, when we have bad moods or big emotions,

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:28.641
we go outside, but it is 104 degrees outside,

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:30.601
and that felt more like torture than anything.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:32.441
So instead, we're all just gonna have some space,

00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:34.929
give a little bit of Grace, and try again tomorrow.
