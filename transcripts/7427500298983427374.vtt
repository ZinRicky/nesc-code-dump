00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
I finally come to the realization that me and my husband

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:03.841
change up our entire lives

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:06.561
and pretty much who we are about every five years.

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:07.881
Sometimes these are small things,

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:09.081
sometimes they're big things.

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:09.721
Like, literally,

00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:11.681
five years ago, we lived in a different part of town.

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:14.481
I was a gym rat. I only really wore athleisure wear.

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:15.801
I didn't have social media,

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:17.481
at least not like, public social media.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:20.081
And we were dead set on being done having kids at two.

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:21.161
The cool thing, though,

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:22.721
is that no matter how much I change,

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.301
no matter how much my husband changes,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.720
no matter how much her life changes,

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:27.201
we tend to do it together.

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:29.861
Like we are fully on for each other's journey.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.160
And I'm starting to feel our chapter turn again,

00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:34.081
and I just can't wait to see what we're gonna turn out

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:35.556
as for the next one.
