00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.560
When I had my first kid,

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:04.361
all of the relationships in my life had to change.

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:06.881
And I think this is a really common struggle for new parents

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:07.881
is that all of a sudden,

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:10.081
they're looking at the relationships with their siblings,

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:12.561
with their family, with their in laws, um,

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:13.601
all completely differently,

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:16.161
because now you're looking through an entirely new lens.

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:17.761
I know for me, as a people pleaser,

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:21.361
my whole life, I accepted the status quo with all of my relationships

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:23.041
and just wanted to keep the peace.

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:25.481
But once it wasn't really about me anymore,

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:28.021
once it was the priority of my children,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.600
everything changed. Because

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:33.481
not only does having a child make you re evaluate how you were raised,

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:36.041
you realize that keeping the peace isn't worth it

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:38.241
if it's gonna be stepping all over all of your, like,

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:39.481
parental instincts.

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:42.441
And I feel like I've also even seen this transition happen

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:45.201
when people get married. People who decide to be child free

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:47.101
or can't have children because of circumstances.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.280
When they're prioritizing their safety and happiness

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:53.561
and well being of their partner versus a family member

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:55.741
or extended family member or parent,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.620
all of the dynamics need to shift or can shift.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.880
Because you're more likely to accept the status quo

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:04.201
that you grew up with if it's just about you,

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:06.381
but once it's about somebody you love,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.220
now you're ready to set some boundaries.
