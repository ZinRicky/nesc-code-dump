So I am here hanging out in the can am while the kids are practicing

00:07.440 --> 00:11.800
and just wanted to hop on here and talk about protein powder launch.

00:11.801 --> 00:14.041
So our protein powder, farmer protein,

00:14.042 --> 00:17.801
launched last week, and it's been so fun,

00:17.802 --> 00:19.141
you guys, like,

00:19.240 --> 00:21.240
getting this over the finish line

00:21.241 --> 00:24.201
and seeing you open it and drink it and love it

00:24.202 --> 00:28.981
has been literally so fun for all of us on the team.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.660
Especially Daniel and I were just.

00:31.680 --> 00:36.820
It's been a project, dream project for us for, like.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.480
We started dreaming about it two years ago,

00:39.481 --> 00:41.321
and then we started working on it a year ago,

00:41.322 --> 00:43.721
so it's been a long time coming,

00:43.722 --> 00:44.861
which is so cool.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.360
Maple Cinnamon is sold out.

00:47.361 --> 00:48.741
The rumors are true.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.760
Um, but we are getting more in a few weeks.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.761
I would say

00:53.762 --> 00:58.121
snag up the chocolate and vanilla if you are wanting to try,

00:58.122 --> 00:59.881
because we will be sold out for a little bit,

00:59.882 --> 01:03.401
so snag it up when you. If there is some left on the website,

01:03.402 --> 01:04.961
but more is coming. So good.

01:04.962 --> 01:06.261
And I just.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.680
I love you guys. This is half a heart.

01:08.681 --> 01:11.866
If I had my other hand, I would do another heart. You guys are the best.
