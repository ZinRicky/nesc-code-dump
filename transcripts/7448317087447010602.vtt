00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
Okay, South Carolina.

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:03.841
This is why it is so important for us to stay vigilant

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:05.201
on what is happening in our state

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:07.121
when it comes to women's reproductive health,

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:09.041
because it is becoming increasingly obvious

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.481
that this is a war against women.

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:12.281
I just Learned that Republican lawmakers

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:15.801
have reintroduced the Equal Prenatal Rights Protection Act,

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:19.401
which would classify an unborn fetus as a person

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:20.481
in the state of South Carolina,

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:23.081
which means that women can be charged with murder

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:24.561
for seeking abortion care.

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:26.021
And you ask yourself, hmm,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.080
does South Carolina have the death penalty?

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:29.081
Yes, we do.

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:31.281
And it calls into question how we

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:31.721
as women

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:34.701
are gonna be able to be able to trust our medical professionals,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.060
because they could rat us into the police.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.880
And what kind of doctors gonna be left in a state like this?

00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:42.401
And the other thought I had is,

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:45.281
as a Jewish woman, this goes against my religious freedom,

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:48.521
because Jewish people do not believe that life begins at conception.

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:50.601
We believe life begins at first breath.

00:00:50.602 --> 00:00:52.261
So call your representatives!

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.120
Make noise! Okay,

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.670
we gotta get this out of here.
