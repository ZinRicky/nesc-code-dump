00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.520
If it was bear claws,

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:03.281
we'd clearly call it a bear.

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:05.821
But because it was her husband's hand,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.900
oh, it was accidental.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.360
We choose bear.

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:13.401
Because even though statistically

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:14.621
we know that

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.000
divorce and leaving is the most dangerous time for a woman's life,

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.081
and even though she can journal and write,

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:23.721
this is exactly what's going to happen,

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.161
I promise you.

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:28.761
And when that exact thing happens and she is proven right,

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.421
even in her death,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.540
she doesn't get the validation she's deserved.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.660
Even when everything is pointing in the right direction,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.980
we are still not believed, and we are still

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.440
getting the shit end of the stick.

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.981
Like, I don't know a fucking polite way to say it.
