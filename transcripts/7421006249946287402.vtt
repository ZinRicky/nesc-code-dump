00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.640
senator may respond to that

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:02.600
first of all governor

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.600
I agree with the Amber Thurman should still be alive

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.240
and there are a lot of people who should still be alive

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:07.860
and I certainly wish that she was

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.740
but you support the policies that took her life

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.140
the maternal mortality rate in Texas alone has jumped 56%

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.120
he continues to support these policies

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.200
he does not care about women's lives

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:26.300
because if you cared about the health and safety of women

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.443
you would not be supporting these policies
