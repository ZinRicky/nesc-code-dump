00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
We have a very special guest in the bra your house today.

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:05.441
May I present to you Mister Jean Butler,

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:07.721
also known as all Man's a Wilder.

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:11.821
Here in your kitchen, this is where it all happens.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.260
I've come to Oklahoma to sign Prairie Man Books,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.580
but you presented an irresistible opportunity.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.280
One of my favorite things in the world,

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.521
which is chocolate chip cookies.

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:27.361
So we're about to make a batch.

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:29.941
Chocolate chip cookies, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.040
Can't get enough of it. Jen has a great recipe.

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:37.161
I'm game. Let's make chocolate chip cookies.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:40.301
We start with the melted butter.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.300
Add a little bit more. Okay,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.540
now we're gonna add 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.540
one egg. I'm putting a dash of vanilla.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.160
Perfect. Wow,

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:55.661
that's more than a dash.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.960
I'm adding one and 1/3 cups of flour.

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.901
Adding a pinch of baking soda.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.080
A pinch. Half a bag of semi sweet chocolate.

00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:07.601
I'm, like,

00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:09.761
trying to convince Dean to eat the.

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:12.001
The cookie dough. That doesn't take much convincing.

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:13.121
This is for you. Oh,

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:14.001
I can lick this. Yeah.

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:15.481
Now we're gonna let it chill,

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:17.301
and then we're gonna bake these cookies.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.580
They will go in the oven now for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.660
Oh, my.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.262
That's a good chocolate chip cookie.
