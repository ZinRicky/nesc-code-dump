most people look at homeless people and say “oh they're junkies” 

00:03.971 --> 00:06.280
I honestly hate when people say that

00:06.281 --> 00:08.800
because it doesn't make them any less human.

00:08.801 --> 00:12.040
I will never stop feeling remorse for people who are struggling

00:12.041 --> 00:13.480
Because I know what it's like to struggle

00:13.481 --> 00:16.480
I know that could be me or it could be you.

00:16.481 --> 00:17.994
hardships hit everyone..

00:17.995 --> 00:21.220
sometimes it genuinely is out of their control

00:21.240 --> 00:22.600
or they just lose their path

00:22.601 --> 00:24.320
So next time you see a person struggling

00:24.321 --> 00:26.400
even if you can't help them financially

00:26.401 --> 00:29.000
Help them with a smile, help them with being kind

00:29.001 --> 00:31.320
Just treat people how you would like to be treated

00:31.321 --> 00:34.018
they're not any less human than you or I
