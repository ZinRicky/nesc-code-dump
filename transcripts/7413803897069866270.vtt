00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.680
I like to give updates about my life as a single mom now

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:04.881
to encourage other mothers

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:06.881
so that you don't have to stay in a shitty marriage

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:07.761
because you're married with somebody.

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.121
And I love when in the comments,

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:11.881
the ladies chime in and give their story,

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:14.801
because you can see, you don't have to stay with somebody

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:15.961
just because you had kids with them.

00:00:15.962 --> 00:00:18.441
You don't have to stay with somebody just because at one time you said,

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:20.241
okay, I vow this and that will. Shit.

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:21.921
Shit changes, okay?

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:25.101
You can get remarried with four kids

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.340
and have somebody that's kind and helpful.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.040
It's. It's not that hard.

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:32.541
It's not the end of the world.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.720
You know the men who are saying

00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:36.601
you're never gonna find somebody to love you?

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:37.961
That's their fucking opinion.

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:41.841
There's plenty of men that do not see children as a repellent.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:42.961
They're not, like,

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:45.201
all gonna run away just because some guys, like,

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:46.721
who gives a fuck? Those are your fucking kids.

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:48.881
And especially when you have that attitude,

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.481
that mentality, these are my kids.

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:51.961
We are a package deal. But,

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:52.641
you know, you're not.

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:54.121
You're not their father. You're not.

00:00:54.122 --> 00:00:56.281
I'm not asking you to do anything more than just be with me

00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:59.701
and be nice to them and just see what happens.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.240
And there's plenty of men that will do that.

00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:05.641
You do not need to stay with somebody just because you have kids.

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:07.481
And just because you have kids,

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:10.090
that's Not gonna be an automatic rejection from other people
