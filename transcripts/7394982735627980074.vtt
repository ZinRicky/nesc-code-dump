00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.620
This is a hot take that you guys may or may not hate me for,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.020
but I got an email last night from one of you.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.960
It was a 22 year old girl asking me about female hustle culture

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:13.841
and like, saying that she,

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:17.681
at 22, feels a really heavy emotional weight

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:19.521
put on her by her female family members

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:20.081
that are quote

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:22.541
unquote brainwashed by female hustle culture.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.920
Um, because she doesn't wanna go to college,

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:30.541
doesn't want a career, and just wants to live the slow feminine life.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.020
Let me just say this. Like,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.800
if you do not have a husband that can provide for you comfortably,

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:41.621
if you do, if you are not a full time mother

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.840
with a husband that can provide for your family,

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:50.661
if you do not have a family that can provide comfortably for you, too,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.920
live slow, right?

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.161
Like, you need to have a job.

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:57.101
You need to work. Like,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.760
you have to provide value.

00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.041
And don't get it twisted. Yes,

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:02.801
I work from home. Yes,

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:04.681
my boyfriend helps me with,

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:05.981
oh, like,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.220
the roof over my head and with stocking our freezer full of meat.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.380
But I still have bills to pay.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.820
I still work full time. I work for his company,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.480
I run my own business. I managed three social media accounts.

00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:26.601
Like, I constantly work and provide value.

00:01:26.602 --> 00:01:28.681
I have hobbies, I have passions,

00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:32.361
I'm constantly learning, I'm constantly elevating myself.

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:33.561
Trying to heal more,

00:01:33.562 --> 00:01:37.541
trying to figure out More ways to add value to the world.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.040
My man and I work as a unit.

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:41.401
We work as a team. Of course,

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:42.401
we have polarity,

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.101
and our relationship is the masculine and the feminine,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.080
because I believe that that's absolutely.

00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:49.301
We both do believe it's absolutely necessary

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.000
for the health of your relationship

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.001
to have that polarity. However,

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:58.081
we also know that if we put together our minds in our unique skill set,

00:01:58.082 --> 00:02:00.081
that we can cultivate financial freedom

00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:03.461
and that slower lifestyle so much faster.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.280
My boyfriend has a spinal injury that gives him constant,

00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:09.761
chronic pain every single day of his life.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.721
And he is still busting his absolute ass

00:02:12.722 --> 00:02:14.861
to scale his pickleball company.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.720
And I help him with that because I have a unique skill set.

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:21.221
I run my own business, and, like,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.680
it's a very fun. It's.

00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:25.881
It's a grind. It's for sure a grind.

00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:28.961
But we know that it will be so worth it

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:31.401
and that two minds are greater than one.

00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:33.241
And diminishing myself as a woman,

00:02:33.242 --> 00:02:35.041
to say that my only value is,

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:37.130
like, my womb is so wrong.
