00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.080
Seed oils and ultra processed foods

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.120
along with factory farmed meats is like

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.400
basically impossible to avoid while traveling,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.560
much less finding raw milk in high quality

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.100
local farmed goods.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.760
What honestly

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.160
makes my life 10,000 times easier when I'm

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.240
traveling to a new place that I've never been to

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.960
is the obseed oil scout.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.240
Traveling can make my diet feel very restrictive,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.820
so this helps a ton.
