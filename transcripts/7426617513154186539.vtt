00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
I love people like this.

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:04.361
This woman is asking about the psychological impact

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:07.001
that leaving your baby right after they're born

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:10.441
to go to work has on a child for the rest of their lives.

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:13.761
And she's right. There's actually a lot of bogus studies out there

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:16.441
showing that it's perfectly fine to put your child in daycare.

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:19.061
And again, biased agenda.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.560
One of my favorite clinical cycle analysts,

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:24.181
her name is Doctor Erica Commissar,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.240
speaks on the matter of leaving your children to go back to work

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:30.601
better than anyone I've ever heard explain it.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:31.881
Mind you, she's done the studies.

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:33.681
She has over 30 years of experience.

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:36.361
And she's not the only doctor that speaks out on this.

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:39.441
She has researched neuroscience, epigenetics,

00:00:39.442 --> 00:00:41.981
attachment theory, behavioral science,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.080
and neuropsychology, which is apparently all of those fields combined.

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:49.201
And she wrote a book called Being There

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:53.361
Why Prioritizing Motherhood in the First Three Years Matters.

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:56.081
The biggest neurological growth spurt that a human has

00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:58.481
is within the first two years of their lives.

00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:01.961
She also discusses that women leaving babies and daycares,

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:03.481
or even at home while they go to work

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:07.641
has created two generations of people with attachment issues.

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:10.921
That is the childhood trauma that is now LED to generations

00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:11.961
like millennials, Gen Zers,

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:15.181
and the ones below us having zero ability to date,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.320
find companionship, find partner.

00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:19.801
Everyone wants to blame social media and dating apps,

00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:21.361
when in really, when reality,

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:23.041
it started way younger than that.

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:26.321
When we were born because our mothers left us to go back to work,

00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:29.161
because that is what our culture taught us was right to do.

00:01:29.162 --> 00:01:30.481
And based off her research,

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:34.601
she has also ranked the types of different care

00:01:34.602 --> 00:01:35.721
that you can give your children

00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:40.621
from least to best, daycare being the absolute worst.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.960
Then she talks about nannies,

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:43.641
and then she talks about having, like,

00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:46.361
a kinship nanny, meaning someone that's related to you.

00:01:46.362 --> 00:01:49.541
Like, maybe your mother helps you watch the baby while you go to work.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.040
When I attempted to work after my first child,

00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:53.521
it was my niece, who's, like,

00:01:53.522 --> 00:01:55.401
my sister. She also gives you, like,

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:56.641
a neurological breakdown

00:01:56.642 --> 00:01:59.321
of what happens to children when you leave them,

00:01:59.322 --> 00:02:01.441
specifically babies, like when they're newborns.

00:02:01.442 --> 00:02:03.821
We tend to go back to work at three months.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.880
That child should still be,

00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:07.521
and I say should, not in a judgy way,

00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:09.741
but it should still be on the breast of the mother.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.520
And she claims that they should not be left for more than,

00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:13.481
like, an hour,

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:15.041
sometimes two hours, max.

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:18.101
We think that because babies are small and cannot communicate

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.600
that they're fine when we leave them,

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:25.281
when in reality, they have these deep sense of abandonment issues.

00:02:25.282 --> 00:02:27.401
Because what most people don't realize

00:02:27.402 --> 00:02:30.241
is that the only reason humans are born so early

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:33.301
is because our heads out grow the mother's body.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.600
So we're carry primates when we come outside, earthbound,

00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:38.961
outside of our mothers.

00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:43.241
We are still supposed to be attached to them for about two years.

00:02:43.242 --> 00:02:45.161
That is why many cultures

00:02:45.162 --> 00:02:47.921
wear their children until they're two years old.

00:02:47.922 --> 00:02:51.641
She also claims that this is why mothers are so unhappy in America

00:02:51.642 --> 00:02:53.601
and why babies cry so much,

00:02:53.602 --> 00:02:55.721
because we are taught to let them cry it out.

00:02:55.722 --> 00:02:57.001
We're taught to put them down,

00:02:57.002 --> 00:02:58.541
that they don't have to be on us.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.120
When in like Eastern European countries and Africa,

00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:06.401
mothers hold their babies all the time and babies don't cry as much.

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:07.841
I co slept with my children

00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:08.761
and I can tell you

00:03:08.762 --> 00:03:12.161
that there was a night and day difference between my children

00:03:12.162 --> 00:03:16.841
and even my second child that I did more with since he was born

00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:20.921
compared to my first, because I Learned from my previous situation.

00:03:20.922 --> 00:03:24.161
She also discusses that how children under the age of one

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.241
have to be soothed moment to moment,

00:03:26.242 --> 00:03:27.801
meaning the minute they cry,

00:03:27.802 --> 00:03:29.441
you are supposed to pick them up and sue them.

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.841
And this is how we regulate their cortisol levels.

00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:33.301
This is how we become.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.160
I believe she calls it a buffer between their stress and them

00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:39.441
and how children are very dependent on their caregiver

00:03:39.442 --> 00:03:41.241
to regulate their emotions for them.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:44.001
Again, this is why I do not agree with the whole cry it out method

00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:45.601
that the boomers taught us.

00:03:45.602 --> 00:03:49.401
Now, we didn't know the impact of what the Boss Babe movement would do

00:03:49.402 --> 00:03:51.801
or having women leave their Children go back to work until,

00:03:51.802 --> 00:03:53.821
of course, generations later,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.440
because we were the Guinea pigs,

00:03:55.441 --> 00:03:58.921
but now they have the actual effects of it.

00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:04.281
They have millions of people and Gen Zers and millennials

00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:07.221
and even some boomers where they can actually take data from

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.000
and figure out why it was so detrimental

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.041
to leave our children at home

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:15.241
to go back to work at such an early age.

00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:18.761
Now, you cannot sue the baby moment to moment when you're in a daycare.

00:04:18.762 --> 00:04:20.121
And I know this first handed

00:04:20.122 --> 00:04:23.681
because I worked at a learning center in East Texas for like,

00:04:23.682 --> 00:04:25.441
six months. It was terrible.

00:04:25.442 --> 00:04:30.081
It was horrible. We had two people working in a room with 13 children,

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:32.041
which I believe was even illegal at that time.

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:33.361
It broke my heart every day

00:04:33.362 --> 00:04:34.401
because there was no way

00:04:34.402 --> 00:04:37.361
I could comfort and soothe every single baby that was there.

00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:39.921
And I could absolutely witness firsthand

00:04:39.922 --> 00:04:42.241
the effects that it was having on their development.

00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:44.441
That is why it is important to have one person

00:04:44.442 --> 00:04:46.481
caretaking for this baby, and ideally,

00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:49.601
it's the mother. She also discusses this thing called share the care,

00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:50.981
I guess, that they do in California,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.080
where they basically,

00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:56.281
parents will share the cost of a nanny to make it more affordable

00:04:56.282 --> 00:04:59.321
so that they have maybe three kids with one nanny.

00:04:59.322 --> 00:05:01.881
And she discusses how that's better than,

00:05:01.882 --> 00:05:02.601
for instance,

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:05.481
putting someone in a daycare where they don't have as much attention

00:05:05.482 --> 00:05:08.581
between The caregiver and 13 other children.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.560
I'll add another video with some of her clips,

00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:11.861
but basically,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.360
I also would like to add that common sense comes into play here.

00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:18.001
I don't like giving my child to anyone.

00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:19.561
Because at the end of the day,

00:05:19.562 --> 00:05:21.961
it was my brain that chemically reacted

00:05:21.962 --> 00:05:23.841
when I got pregnant and then gave birth.

00:05:23.842 --> 00:05:29.081
It was my amygdala and prefrontal cortex that swelled and changed

00:05:29.082 --> 00:05:31.601
so that I could be more attentive to my child.

00:05:31.602 --> 00:05:34.041
Even in the case of my husband watching my, like,

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.561
Newborn children, I never wanted to offend him,

00:05:36.562 --> 00:05:37.761
but I would always be like,

00:05:37.762 --> 00:05:38.881
hey, are you watching him?

00:05:38.882 --> 00:05:40.261
Hey, is he near a pool?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.240
Can you see your peripheral vision?

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.881
Is he there? Because a mom can see literally everything.

00:05:44.882 --> 00:05:46.941
It is innate and biological.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.560
No one can ever love or watch your child better than you can

00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:56.041
after you birth them. But day after day,

00:05:56.042 --> 00:05:59.001
we give birth, we go back to work after three months,

00:05:59.002 --> 00:06:02.341
and then we leave our children with strangers,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.300
in the case of daycare, at least.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.720
And then they come home with RSV or a broken arm

00:06:06.721 --> 00:06:10.041
or even maybe sexual trauma.

00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:11.281
And we sit here and we wonder,

00:06:11.282 --> 00:06:12.921
how could that happen? Well,

00:06:12.922 --> 00:06:13.641
quite frankly,

00:06:13.642 --> 00:06:17.221
it's because nobody could care for your child the way you did.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.160
Not physiologically, not biologically,

00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:20.401
not spiritually. So

00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:21.841
with some of these studies that have come out

00:06:21.842 --> 00:06:23.761
saying that it's perfectly normal for our children,

00:06:23.762 --> 00:06:28.461
To leave us and go to daycare very early in their infancy.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.060
I have to question, where's the common sense?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.640
And who put out those studies?

00:06:32.641 --> 00:06:38.181
And is it pointing us in a direction of a very biased agenda?

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.000
Lastly, I will end with this.

00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:43.041
It is something you cannot take back.

00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:44.961
I have chosen with my family,

00:06:44.962 --> 00:06:47.841
to sacrifice whatever extra income I could bring

00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:49.761
to stay home with my children.

00:06:49.762 --> 00:06:51.921
Because if it takes the first three years,

00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:53.621
according to these neuroscientists,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.000
to create the best foundation for the rest of the child's life,

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:01.661
they've literally said, just give it the first two to three years,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.280
and there's almost no way of messing up your child.

00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:06.561
I would rather live without regret.

00:07:06.562 --> 00:07:10.041
I would rather tell women this so that they can live without regret,

00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:11.401
because at the end of the day,

00:07:11.402 --> 00:07:13.241
it is such a short chapter.

00:07:13.242 --> 00:07:15.721
It is such a small journey.

00:07:15.722 --> 00:07:18.581
And even if, on the off chance we are wrong,

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.060
you didn't hurt the situation as a mother

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.800
by being there for your baby when they were born,

00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:26.801
versus taking the risk of dropping them off with strangers

00:07:26.802 --> 00:07:29.441
and just seeing how they turn out when they're 25.

00:07:29.442 --> 00:07:31.141
Those are just my thoughts.
