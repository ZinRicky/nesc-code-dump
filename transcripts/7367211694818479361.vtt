00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
Here, in case you haven't noticed it,

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:03.281
there is a war going on out there.

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:05.281
And you women started, oh, no,

00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:07.681
we did not. But that is a typical male attitude.

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:08.481
Now, the truth is

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:10.681
that we women haven't had enough power

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:13.321
or money or confidence to start much of anything,

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:15.721
but we sure as heck get the blame for everything.

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:17.481
I'll tell you something else.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:20.401
I love men. I love this one.

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:22.701
But you cannot ignore history.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
History has shown that in general,

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.921
it has been the men who have done the raping and the robbing

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:30.801
and the killing and the war mongering for the last 2,000 years.

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:33.441
It has been the men who have done the pillaging and the beheading

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:36.001
and the subjugating of whole races into slavery.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.961
It has been the men who have done the law making and the money making

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:42.001
and most of the mischief making.

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:45.001
So if the world isn't quite what you had in mind,

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.621
you have only yourselves to thank.
