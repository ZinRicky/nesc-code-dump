00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.920
I just saw a video where the girls like

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:05.201
imagine not liking me cause I'm living the life with him that you wanted

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:07.561
and she's kinda being like smug about it

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:11.101
and like at first of course I wanna be like Ew

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.120
but you know what

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:14.841
if you could be bothered like that

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:16.441
that's a you issue

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:20.321
if seeing somebody with that man gets you like

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:21.321
all worked up and bothered

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:24.141
that is dead ass a you issue

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.860
she's happy as fuck

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.400
look at her eating her fucking fast food in her car

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:31.041
talking about her man

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.661
you're the one all hot and bothered

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.100
do you know what I mean

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.200
d center men from your life

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:42.281
a man is most definitely not the most important thing in your life

00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:47.841
a man is most definitely not gonna always add to your life

00:00:47.842 --> 00:00:48.941
they can be fun

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.860
I'm not saying don't have them around

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.360
but I'm just saying like

00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:54.781
figure your shit out so that a man

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.560
is it so fucking important that some chick

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:01.981
eating her fucking hash Browns in her car is gonna get you pissed off

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.780
get it you know what I mean

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.740
if you could get that bothered

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.240
that says something about you

00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:10.081
it doesn't mean the man is so fucking great

00:01:10.082 --> 00:01:11.561
you need to be crying and chasing him

00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:12.821
it means like

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.280
where are you in your own heart that you're getting this worked up over like

00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:20.641
another person

00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:21.461
you know what I mean
