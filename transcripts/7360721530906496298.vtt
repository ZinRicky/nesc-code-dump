00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.200
How did we, a food staple among our ancestors for thousands of years,

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.721
become a food that is so heavily avoided today?

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:08.681
First, not all wheat is the same.

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:10.281
And if you shop at the grocery store,

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:12.681
you're likely buying products with modern wheat varieties.

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:15.441
Modern wheat came about by intensive conventional breeding,

00:00:15.442 --> 00:00:17.641
which drastically altered the wheat from its original

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:18.641
and most primitive form.

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:19.961
During the 20th century,

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:22.081
wheat was bred to be a high yield crop

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:24.961
and to have more of that stretchy gluten for baking purposes.

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:27.041
That stretchy gluten makes big baked goods.

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:27.961
Think Cinnabons,

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:30.281
fluffy biscuits and really soft loaves of bread.

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:32.121
This is what we call Franken wheat.

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:34.721
Franken wheat was also bred to be resistant to round up,

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.721
a toxic herbicide that controls weeds

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:39.721
and speeds up harvest time by prematurely drying out the crust.

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:42.121
Life is say is the active ingredient in Round Up

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:43.321
and is a known carcinogen.

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:44.841
Weed to avoid at all cost.

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:46.481
I love to work with eincorn wheat

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:50.017
because it's the most ancient variety and still in its original form.
