Today, the creative team is coming up to the farm,

00:03.801 --> 00:08.761
and we are going to do some content and photographs

00:08.762 --> 00:11.641
for products that are on the website right now.

00:11.642 --> 00:15.301
So we are shooting it in a little barn on the property.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.640
This barn has a beautiful window,

00:17.641 --> 00:20.521
some natural light, and some nice wood walls.

00:20.522 --> 00:23.981
So we brought all the products up there.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.040
We got the sourdough kit out,

00:26.041 --> 00:28.521
we got the beeswax candles.

00:28.522 --> 00:31.241
Even Willow was somehow bubbling in this barn.

00:31.242 --> 00:33.341
It was so cold in the barn today.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.440
We were so impressed

00:34.441 --> 00:36.881
that Willow was still bubbling throughout the photo shoot.

00:36.882 --> 00:39.601
One of my favorite parts about the photo shoot today

00:39.602 --> 00:42.441
was just seeing all of our products together,

00:42.442 --> 00:45.861
working together to make something so beautiful.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.200
Our sourdough kit, for instance,

00:48.201 --> 00:51.401
has been one of our pillar products for a long time.

00:51.402 --> 00:55.601
These are some French jams that we got in seasonally for the holidays,

00:55.602 --> 00:59.801
and they are literally the most beautiful tasting.

00:59.802 --> 01:02.141
So delicious. I'm so excited about these.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.520
Got our beautiful salts hand harvested from France.

01:05.521 --> 01:11.081
Another perk with today's photo shoot is that we got to eat everything.

01:11.082 --> 01:12.721
After we photographed it,

01:12.722 --> 01:17.461
we sprinkled the vanilla Bourbon French salt on the sourdough cookies,

01:17.960 --> 01:21.160
and then we knew as soon as we did that we got to eat them.

01:21.161 --> 01:22.521
But what I didn't realize

01:22.522 --> 01:26.061
is that the cookies actually froze to the cookie sheet.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.800
It was so cold in the barn,

01:27.801 --> 01:30.141
but we ate them, and They were still so good frozen.

01:30.280 --> 01:35.780
All these products are products that I use at home in my kitchen,

01:35.960 --> 01:39.580
and I love them, and I'm just excited to share them with you.

01:39.840 --> 01:43.760
We now have a build your own box option on the website.

01:43.761 --> 01:46.581
So you can go on the website and choose any cuts that you like,

01:46.720 --> 01:49.200
and you can build your own box,

01:49.201 --> 01:50.421
which is so exciting.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.880
We were getting very cold by the end of the afternoon.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.501
We could barely use our fingers,

01:56.760 --> 01:58.720
so we knew it was time to wrap up.

01:58.721 --> 02:02.061
We ended the photo session with our jerky,

02:02.240 --> 02:04.120
which is just beef and French salt,

02:04.121 --> 02:05.901
two ingredients which we love.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.780
We got in the truck, cranked up the heater,

02:08.800 --> 02:12.234
and ended the afternoon with some warm bone broth and a
