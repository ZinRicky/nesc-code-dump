00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.180
Tomorrow is International Day Against Homophobia,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.120
Transphobia and biphobia, a day to stand against bigotry

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:15.861
and hate against the 2S LGBTQIA community.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.440
This year has been a difficult one for our Manitoba

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:24.981
2 s LGBTQIA relatives.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.320
Family friendly

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:33.221
drag queen story time was targeted by aggressive counter protesters.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.460
Proposed book bands in Brandon

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.580
are threatened to erase queer families from school libraries.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.800
National organization pushed misinformation

00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:51.701
events like the Million March for kids in cities across Canada,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.580
including here in Winnipeg.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.580
The former PC government not only tolerated this hate,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.540
they encouraged it. Heather Stephenson

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.100
broke her promise to walk alongside the 2S LGBTQIA Manitobans

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.300
and use her first pride as premiere for a photo op.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.820
Members opposite

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.860
tried to create a narrative about the member for Kirkfield Park

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
that he was a danger to children

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.821
when he ran to become the first trans man

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.860
elected to the Manitoba Legislative Assembly.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.780
The member for Fort White

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.700
repeatedly called community concerns about book bands

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.140
fear mongering

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.220
while at the same time he was the face of fear mongering ads

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.540
endangering two ass LGBTQI youth.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.300
For years, the member for borderland has routinely refused to clap

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.400
or stand for two s LGBTQIA Manitobans

00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:11.421
honored in this very chamber

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.560
order.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.480
Their federal leader Pierre Poliov

00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:22.581
continues to spread disinformation

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.560
and ally himself with people who want to harm the two US

00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:30.421
LGBTQI community.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.860
And that entire side of the house made targeting transgender kids

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.620
a core part of their failed election campaign.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.300
Who targets Children, each and every one of them.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.700
But Manitobans have shown there is no order,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.020
order,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.400
order.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.580
You may not like what you hear,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.940
but I expect respect in this chamber.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.760
The honorable minister of families,

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:17.581
we go at your honorable speaker.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.820
But Manitobans have shown

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.820
there is no space for hate in our beautiful province.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.100
Mənə çovğun.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.980
Manitobans showed up with signs at school board meetings

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.660
and drag queen story times.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.380
They attended Brandon school board meetings in the hundreds.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.960
Thousands of people even gathered on the steps of this very building

00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:53.981
to stand up against homophobic,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.940
transphobic, so called parental rights movement.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.540
Fighting hate and fear with love and joy and support.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.880
And when this former cold

00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:13.101
and callous PC government spoke at last year's Winnipeg Pride parade,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.440
Manitobans turned their backs on them and rejected their hate,

00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:20.501
discrimination and division.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.900
Manitobans have shown we believe in a better future together.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.000
To our 2S LGBTQIA relatives, no,

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:38.121
we continue and will always stand with you

00:04:38.122 --> 00:04:43.621
and will always fight against anyone who tries to target, devalue,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.580
bully or harm you. That includes holding members opposite

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.580
accountable for what their failed PC government tried to do to you.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.780
So when the member opposite gets up to speak in a couple of seconds,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.720
don't believe what they tell you,

00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:07.541
believe what they show you and continue to show you.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.420
Because today

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.760
the only thing they should be doing is getting up in the house

00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:17.021
and apologizing.
