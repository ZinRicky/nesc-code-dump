00:00.280 --> 00:03.240
I gave birth to my first baby at 19,

00:03.241 --> 00:04.641
and now I'm pregnant,

00:04.642 --> 00:06.981
about to give birth to my third baby.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.340
So let's talk about birth.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.500
I'm still very pregnant,

00:12.640 --> 00:15.200
but we're getting closer to giving birth,

00:15.201 --> 00:16.401
and this time around,

00:16.402 --> 00:18.181
I'm doing another home birth.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.440
I just wanna start out by saying that this is not for everyone,

00:21.441 --> 00:23.721
and everyone should decide what they wanna do,

00:23.722 --> 00:26.041
since it's their individual experience.

00:26.042 --> 00:27.861
This is just what I prefer.

00:28.040 --> 00:28.880
With my first,

00:28.881 --> 00:32.841
I obviously didn't know a lot about birth and doctors and all of that,

00:32.842 --> 00:36.161
so I just went to a normal doctor, um,

00:36.162 --> 00:40.321
for all of my pregnancy checkups until I was at week 36.

00:40.322 --> 00:40.641
And then

00:40.642 --> 00:44.201
I just realized that I was not getting treated like a person would,

00:44.202 --> 00:45.741
more like a number.

00:45.840 --> 00:46.680
And I didn't like that,

00:46.681 --> 00:48.441
so I switched over to a midwife,

00:48.442 --> 00:50.421
and it was the best thing I could have done.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.720
So I knew for my second baby,

00:52.721 --> 00:54.401
I wanted to do a home birth

00:54.402 --> 00:57.381
and just go with a midwife from the beginning.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.360
And I had the sweetest midwife

00:59.361 --> 01:02.201
that made me feel so heard and understood

01:02.202 --> 01:04.901
and supported in whatever I wanted to do.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.680
All of our appointments were an hour long,

01:07.681 --> 01:09.281
and she listened to my concerns,

01:09.282 --> 01:10.401
how I was feeling,

01:10.402 --> 01:11.741
what I wanted to do.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.460
And ultimately,

01:13.480 --> 01:16.660
at 36 weeks, we came up with a good birth plan.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.080
On the day I went into labor,

01:19.081 --> 01:20.961
we had my husband,

01:20.962 --> 01:23.681
sister Piper, her husband at the time,

01:23.682 --> 01:24.601
me, him,

01:24.602 --> 01:26.421
and then the midwives. Over.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.400
It all started after I put rumble to sleep,

01:30.401 --> 01:32.141
and as soon as she was asleep,

01:32.280 --> 01:37.460
I induced labor myself by dry pumping and drinking this

01:37.760 --> 01:40.260
insanely gross cocktail of things.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.680
I sent lucky to get me a frosty from Wendy's.

01:43.681 --> 01:45.121
I was craving it so bad.

01:45.122 --> 01:46.421
And while he was gone,

01:46.480 --> 01:48.400
my water broke and I started contracting.

01:48.401 --> 01:51.261
So I called him to come home immediately.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.720
He rushed home,

01:52.721 --> 01:53.361
and at this point,

01:53.362 --> 01:56.481
my contractions were so strong and really close together

01:56.482 --> 01:58.861
that we decided to call our midwife.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.000
I think she was about 30 minutes away,

02:02.001 --> 02:04.601
and she barely made it in time.

02:04.602 --> 02:05.561
Soon as she arrived,

02:05.562 --> 02:07.921
I told her that I felt the urge to push,

02:07.922 --> 02:09.481
so I started pushing,

02:09.482 --> 02:11.141
and he was born.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.120
Whole experience was pretty hands on for lucky and I,

02:14.121 --> 02:15.761
because lucky was the one catching the baby,

02:15.762 --> 02:17.001
supporting me through labor,

02:17.002 --> 02:19.921
and the midwives were there to make sure that everything was okay.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.881
Not even two or three hours later,

02:21.882 --> 02:26.581
we were just in bed, snuggling our baby like nothing happened.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.400
So for this baby,

02:28.401 --> 02:30.321
we're planning the exact same thing.

02:30.322 --> 02:31.401
Having a home birth,

02:31.402 --> 02:33.581
probably laboring in my bedroom.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.860
Hopefully my kids will be in bed by the time I go labor.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.880
We ordered a homebreathing kit,

02:39.881 --> 02:42.481
which basically is just a bunch of essentials you'll need,

02:42.482 --> 02:45.301
like a mattress cover and other things,

02:45.840 --> 02:47.740
and I can't wait.
