00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Let's get my mom mobile ready for summer.

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.481
I tend to be a car hoarder.

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:07.041
This place is a disaster most of the time.

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:09.481
Look at the trunk of my car right now, guys.

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:11.621
This is what's left over after traveling

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.520
and basically living out of this thing.

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:15.881
So it was time to do a full refresh,

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.721
starting with tackling the mess.

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:20.061
I need my car to be functional and organized,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.080
but still taking advantage of the fact that I have three rows

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:24.341
and not a big trunk.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.560
I found this really great organizer on Amazon.

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:30.281
It hangs in the back of the third row and connects to the headrests

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:32.741
and just allows for so much more storage and organization.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.200
I then grab some plastic bins to put in their activity stuff,

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:37.561
things that we're gonna need every week

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:38.681
because they have different activity.

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:41.041
And then I started filling the compartments with things that we need.

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:42.581
Bug spray, sunscreen,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.520
diapers, and wipe.

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.881
Always gotta have a stack of balls in the back of the car,

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:46.481
and, of course,

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:48.401
beach towels. This is just the beginning.

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:49.361
I'm gonna add more stuff,

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:51.141
but it's definitely a transformation.
