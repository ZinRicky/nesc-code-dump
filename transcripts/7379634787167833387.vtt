00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.480
We're all done with the documentary.

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:05.161
I mean, they haven't done the footage and stuff,

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:06.641
they haven't edited it,

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:09.161
but I'm like done hanging out with them.

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:09.961
And it's so funny

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:13.201
because it was just a couple hours over the last two days.

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:16.421
It was a couple hours yesterday and a couple hours today.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.640
But because everything we talked about was some of like

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:20.521
the most deepest parts of my life,

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:23.821
the most painful parts of my life, and, you know, whatever.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.800
It feels like such a connection.

00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.121
And so I'm like, so sad that they're leaving.

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.101
I'm like,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.280
they live in Fucking France.

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:35.381
I don't know the next time I will see these women,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.920
but just this little bit of time was really impactful.

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:42.441
It's really beautiful when a woman supports you and encourages you

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:43.861
and validates you.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.760
And so to have women from across the fucking world say, wow,

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:50.881
I see you, I hear you,

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:53.941
you're not crazy, was like, beautiful.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.100
So I'm gonna miss them.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.057
Now I wanna go to France cause I have friends there.
