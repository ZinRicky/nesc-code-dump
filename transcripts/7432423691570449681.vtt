00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.213
I have been itching to 

00:00:01.214 --> 00:00:02.200
deep clean this pool

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:03.907
ever since we moved in here about 

00:00:03.908 --> 00:00:04.560
18 months ago

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:05.920
and my husband has always vetoed

00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:07.020
any plans that I've had to 

00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:08.080
deep clean around the pool

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:09.600
and as much as I hate to admit it

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.600
he's probably right

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:12.585
probably not the best idea to water blast a 

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:14.120
whole lot of gunk into a full pool

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:16.118
but now that it's empty I cannot tell you 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.880
how excited I am

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:18.520
I have been waiting for this day

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:20.346
and not just cause I find water blasting 

00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:22.040
extremely fkn cathartic on its own

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:23.579
and not just cause I knew that these 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.160
grout lines were gonna come up so good

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.238
but and I hate the term but I would consider 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.440
myself a clean freak right

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.190
so I was sitting poolside all summer long 

00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:31.400
last summer watching the kids

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:33.633
and I swear all I could see was this 

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:34.600
grotty as grout

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.840
and whenever I was in the pool

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:37.617
or maybe sitting on the edge of the pool

00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:38.240
 or in the spa

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:40.160
I was .. disgusted if I'm honest

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:41.878
don't already know we are

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:42.360
 insane

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:44.382
we're currently DIY pool renovating 

00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:47.360
a 50 year old pool with no pool renovation experience

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:49.480
and these I believe are the original bricks

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.160
so most will be 50 years old

00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:52.520
they have seen some things

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.280
I imagine that they've had a good life

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:55.360
a few have been replaced

00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:58.240
and many of them have big chips and gouges taken out of them

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:00.520
just the wear and tear of a space well loved

00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:02.320
But theyâ€™re also covered in mould and algae

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.920
mineral deposits probably pool chemicals

00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:07.680
sunscreen and organic materials from just the weather

00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:09.440
after so long of wanting to do it

00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:11.800
it felt so good to give them a good deep clean

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:14.920
we've been battling this algae infestation ever since we moved in

00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:17.160
constantly scrubbing it adjusting the chemicals

00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:18.240
but now that it's drained

00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:20.880
I was able to really get in there and give it a good blast off

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.320
it felt so good but until we reseal this plaster

00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:24.960
which we will in another video

00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:26.880
we'll just keep battling this issue because the 

00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.160
concrete is porous at the moment

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:30.162
and so the algae just lives inside the holes 

00:01:30.163 --> 00:01:31.320
and just keeps coming back?

00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:33.200
by the way I didn't know if I was just tripping

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:34.972
but at the start of this the pool was most 

00:01:34.973 --> 00:01:35.880
definitely white right

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:37.240
but I swear if you look at it now

00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:38.880
you can see blue peeking through

00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:40.720
which makes me think that it must have been blue once

00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:41.980
and then maybe it was painted

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.400
but pretty much all of that white paint is gone anyway

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.920
cause in so many spots it's just bare concrete anyway

00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:49.240
in the last video we chipped off all of those tiles

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.360
I'll link it in the caption if you wanna go back and watch

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.800
cause that was oddly satisfying

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:54.320
now we're priming all around the waterline

00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:55.760
ready to lay our new tiles

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:57.052
quick reminder of where we started 

00:01:57.053 --> 00:01:58.160
and this is where we've got to

00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:59.280
here's a sneak peek of the tile

00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:00.320
and I'm posting in real time

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.046
so I'm so sorry but come back soon
