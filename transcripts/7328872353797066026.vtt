00:00.320 --> 00:01.920
This is actually a set,

00:01.920 --> 00:03.220
uh, from TikTok.

00:03.240 --> 00:04.920
I love it. It is very,

00:04.920 --> 00:07.480
very comfy. Perfect for just being at home.

00:07.480 --> 00:09.360
It's very thin material,

00:09.360 --> 00:10.400
so it's like I said,

00:10.400 --> 00:11.080
it's very comfy,

00:11.080 --> 00:12.040
but it's not gonna, like,

00:12.040 --> 00:13.640
keep you warm outside or anything.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.380
I would really like to get it in other colors, too.

00:16.560 --> 00:17.760
And I have worn it, like,

00:17.760 --> 00:18.480
out of the house,

00:18.480 --> 00:19.440
but when I wear out of the house,

00:19.440 --> 00:21.040
I usually just wear the top pieces,

00:21.040 --> 00:21.560
and then I wear,

00:21.560 --> 00:22.640
like, different pants,

00:22.640 --> 00:23.820
and it's perfect.
