00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
Trump just announced

00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:03.241
he's gonna ban all transgender women from playing sports

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:05.401
if elected because of one transgender athlete

00:00:05.402 --> 00:00:07.681
on the San Jose State University volleyball team

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:08.681
named Blair Fleming.

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:11.761
A interaction from her in a game went viral on conservative Twitter

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:14.081
where they were accusing her of hitting a girl on the other team

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:15.301
in the head with the volleyball.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.840
First of all, that did not happen.

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:19.121
Second of all, if you watch the actual fucking full video,

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:21.401
she spikes the volleyball as one does in volleyball game.

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:22.801
The other girl gets hit in the shoulder,

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:23.881
stands up, smiles,

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:25.801
keeps the ball in play, does not walk off,

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:26.841
is not injured, nothing

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.361
is literally completely fine.

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.961
Which is why this whole thing is so frustrating and devastating

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:32.881
because Blair Fleming's position on that team,

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:36.201
just her presence on it, has caused four universities this year

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.761
to forfeit their games against her

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:40.881
in protest. She has been on the team for two full years

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:43.361
and she also is like not even their MVP or anything.

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:45.841
And now all of a sudden it's like a hot button election issue.

00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:47.321
Now teams don't wanna play against her.

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:50.401
And now Trump is using that to fuel his conservative agenda

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:52.641
of trying to get all transgender women out of sports.

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:54.041
Which really if you think about it,

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:55.641
is just misogyny repackage

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:57.681
cause they're acting like they wanna protect women.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.921
But what is protecting women about the fact that now

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:00.521
all the other girls

00:01:00.522 --> 00:01:02.921
in The San Jose State team weren't allowed to play their sport

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:05.081
because the other teams are forfeiting also,

00:01:05.082 --> 00:01:06.841
what's protecting women about the idea that

00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:08.161
if you are a woman playing a sport,

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:10.401
you cannot possibly handle the physical contact

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:11.961
that comes with your sport?

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:14.041
Like, they're saying that that girl who got hit in the shoulder

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:15.681
must be so weak and so feeble

00:01:15.682 --> 00:01:16.841
that she could not possibly be

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:19.361
get hit in the shoulder by a volleyball in her sport.

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:21.481
Like, it is so clearly misogyny,

00:01:21.482 --> 00:01:21.801
just, like,

00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:24.281
blatantly repackaged. And we also know from, like,

00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:26.221
Amani Khalifa and other past experiences

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.680
that this is going to affect women of color even more.

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:29.707
It's disgusting to me.
