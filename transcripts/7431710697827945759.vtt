00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540
This. Oh,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.720
bags on bags on bags on bags.

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:09.581
I ordered the Love Duke or whatever travel bag.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.520
I'm very excited. Okay.

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:19.421
Packaged amazingly. Definitely save some life.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.240
Oh, wow.

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:23.141
It really is safely package.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.860
Hold up.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.640
Oh, I love it.

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.261
Let's see what it's like on.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.480
Oh, this is fucking perfect.

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.381
Oh my god, I love it.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.840
Okay. It's got mad space.

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:37.381
I love that you can cinch it.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.820
Okay, it's got this for the suitcase.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.840
Oh, nice quick shit.

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:45.081
You just get to something,

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:48.301
but it's not here, so it's safe.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.680
Like this sturdy ass handle.

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:51.921
Oh, a pocket here.

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:53.401
Oh, and it's nice inside.

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:55.161
It's like soft. A bag here

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:57.301
in case you gotta hold it this way.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.820
Okay. I love this thing.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.660
Pocket with pockets. Pockets on pockets, bitches.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.680
Okay, this is why I got it.

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:08.801
Cause it opens up like a suitcase,

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.961
so I can still fill it like a suitcase.

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:13.861
This one's waterproof. I love that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.360
This one, mesh one for socks and undies so you don't lose it.

00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:21.261
Got this thing so your clothes don't go everywhere.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.820
This is exactly what I wanted,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.620
these things with this guy.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.320
Oh, this is for shoes.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.941
This is very nice.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.820
And then this. Oh, okay.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.160
It's a 50 liter. And I was getting nervous

00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:43.621
because I saw everybody else gets the 40 liter.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.960
But I wanted to have extra space because I could always sit.

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:48.681
That's why I wanted these cinching things too,

00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:49.241
because I was Like, well,

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.321
I'd rather have the 50 liter

00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:53.281
that I could cinch it down and just use it as, like,

00:01:53.282 --> 00:01:55.601
a carry on. This is all I'm gonna bring.

00:01:55.602 --> 00:01:59.221
I'm like little weekend trips with my man.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.460
Cause I'm not motherfucking married to no piece of shit no more.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.160
She a free bitch. She a free bitch.

00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:08.621
Going on trips. Going on trips.
