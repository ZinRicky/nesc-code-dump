Wanna save time and money while grooming your dogs?

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:06.541
Check out this grooming kit that I found on TikTok Shop.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.720
It literally sucks away the hair while you're grooming your dog.

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:11.361
I have four dogs here on the farm

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:13.181
and the first one up is Lieutenant Dan.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.200
He is a Bernese mountain dog and Great Pyreneese mix

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:18.401
and he has an extremely dense double coat.

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:20.601
I love the slicker brush attachment

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:22.841
that just sucks the hair right into the canister.

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:24.321
There's also a little clean up tool

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:26.561
so any hair that dropped on the floor from the dog

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:28.161
can easily be cleaned up.

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:30.001
I also love this razor attachment

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.681
because he does get these mats behind his ears

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.781
and that easily cut them off and work on his Grinch feet.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.280
The slicker brush easily work through his mats

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.621
and the vacuum canister is so quiet.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.880
After our enjoyable pamper session

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:45.001
he is back out on the pasture for work.

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.285
