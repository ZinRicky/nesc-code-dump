00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
I worked for child support department in my early 20s.

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.201
That was enough for me to realize

00:00:04.202 --> 00:00:06.201
I had to always be financially independent

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:07.841
and never solely on a man.

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:09.781
It was scary seeing women struggle.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.900
Not my words. Read the comment.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.680
Seems like a few people didn't like the delivery last time,

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.781
so I'll say it. Nice and soft and calm.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.320
It is a tale as old as time that a woman is dependent on a man,

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:26.281
and then at some point in her life,

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:27.541
she gets left.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.660
Whether that's because he cheated on her with the secretary,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.320
he found a younger model, he moved on with someone else,

00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.161
or she woke up and realized, fuck,

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:37.521
I don't like this. This is miserable.

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:39.061
I can't live like this anymore.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.840
Something's gonna happen. Maybe he dies,

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.861
but something's gonna happen

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.440
where you're probably not gonna be in this relationship anymore.

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:52.101
And to have put all of your financial eggs in the basket of one person

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.800
is not smart. Whether you're listening to women who are telling you

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.841
as one of the ex wives, this is a bad idea,

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:03.641
or you're listening to the children saying,

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:05.721
my mom had to go through. Blah, blah,

00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:06.601
blah, blah, blah.

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:10.961
Or people that worked for child support and other agencies that are,

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:12.721
you know, surrounding this.

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:14.781
This type of situation,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.600
everybody will say, oh, yeah,

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:18.881
when you really look at it,

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:20.981
look down into the nitty gritty of it,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.200
yeah, no,

00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:23.481
it's not. It's It.

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.881
That's not a good idea. It's definitely not a good idea.

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:28.801
So just. If it sounds too good to be true.

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:30.041
It. It is.

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:32.294
It is. It is. I promise it is.
