00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.420
Need to make sure that your hair is the way that I like it.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.760
People always ask,

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:07.681
what are some of the red flags that I missed or that I overlooked?

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:12.041
And this one really strikes such a nerve because one of our first huge,

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.761
big blow up arguments was over my hair.

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:16.421
We were gonna go to a party

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.160
and bump into some of his old high school friends

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:20.281
from back in the day.

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:22.141
Some people he wanted to impress.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.320
Always mooching off at the woman's cloud.

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:26.301
But anyway,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.680
and he was like, hey,

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:30.901
I really like it when you blow dry your hair straight.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.120
It looks so fabulous when you blow dry it straight and get it all wavy

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.541
and, you know, beautiful.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.280
And so I took my curly ass hair

00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:43.361
and tried everything I could do to get it straight.

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:45.761
But it was a hot summer night and it was a little humid.

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:46.721
It wasn't working.

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:51.681
I know what he was wanting me to go for, and it wasn't coming out.

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:55.321
So I just threw it back in a bun and I was like, hey,

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:55.681
you know, like,

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:58.081
this is kind of the best I can do because of the night.

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.361
It's hot, we're gonna be outside.

00:00:59.362 --> 00:01:01.081
Like, this is also just, like, more practical.

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:05.221
Like, if I wear my hair blow dried and like, with the flips,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.520
you know, it's gonna look like shit halfway through the night.

00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:10.561
So the effect that we're going for, anyway,

00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:11.321
Is not gonna be.

00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:12.521
It's gonna look good right now,

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:13.401
and by the time we get there,

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:14.501
it's gonna look like shit.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.320
I mean, a fucking screaming match over what a disappointment I was. And,

00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:24.841
oh, my god. Okay,

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:26.321
I guess that's good enough.

00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:29.461
I mean, I hope my friends are still, like,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.020
all kinds of guilt and shame and making me feel so ugly and, like,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.380
I'm lucky that I even get to be there. And.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.100
And then we compromised on some other hairstyle,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.280
and I remember just being, like,

00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:45.621
really self conscious all night, and him just kind of, like,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.200
giving me looks all night.

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:48.381
And I was like,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.680
you know, maybe he was just really nervous to meet his old friends.

00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:53.201
He was, you know,

00:01:53.202 --> 00:01:53.561
I mean, like,

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:54.321
it was. I get it.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:55.521
It's a lot of pressure,

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:56.321
you know? Like,

00:01:56.322 --> 00:01:57.081
he just. You know.

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:58.441
I mean, I do want him to be, like,

00:01:58.442 --> 00:02:00.041
proud and excited about his girlfriend.

00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:04.501
Like, I totally just ignored my whole gut feeling on that one.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.920
Big regret. Big,

00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:06.749
big, big regret.
