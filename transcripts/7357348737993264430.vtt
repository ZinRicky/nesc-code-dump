00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.560
yes I did forget that part

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:04.401
Child Protective Services will interview each of your children individually

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:07.561
as well one of my children is disabled and nonverbal

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:09.641
they still pull her and like

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.341
sit with her and attempt to talk to her

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.200
but now they do it at school

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:14.961
they have never had them do it at school before

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:16.481
but this time they came to my house saying

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.720
we've already met with the kids

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:18.521
we've already talked to them

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:19.741
we've heard their side

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.000
so it's like because you better fucking be honest

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.001
because kids are honest

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.001
kids don't know how to lie

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:28.141
and especially they catch them in the middle of the day at school

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.120
the kid is gonna

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:31.281
you know and you know

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:31.881
say what

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:34.061
what the fuck is going on in their life so

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.040
also the the Child Protective Service investigators explain this to me

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:40.361
and this is how I've always understood it

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:43.581
it's not someone calling a claim against you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.760
both parents are like

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:46.721
being investigated

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:48.861
and both parents are on the chopping block

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.720
this is an investigation into the children

00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:55.101
and the safety of their life and their environments

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200
that's why they go to both

00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:59.821
it doesn't matter who the report was called on

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.080
that doesn't matter

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.761
all that matters is something triggered a call

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:06.681
and now Child Protective Services is looking out for these kids

00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:08.761
it's not like both parents are

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:10.961
are under the microscope

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:11.901
whether it was

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.200
whether you're the parent that they're claiming something

00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:16.741
did something or not

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.880
they're still looking at both parents equally as hard

00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:20.681
cause they're like well what is going on in these kids lives

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:22.801
it's just an open door into the kids lives

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:25.881
it's not necessarily like rawr

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:27.881
you're the bad guy and they're looking at you some kind of way

00:01:27.882 --> 00:01:32.321
so like they all work this job and understand how it works

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:35.161
and understand the people who call in calls

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:35.561
you know what I mean

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:38.301
like no one's oblivious to what's going on

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.280
sometimes they just don't have a lot of power to do much

00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:43.921
or they do have power and they do take action

00:01:43.922 --> 00:01:46.841
but it's truly not as scary as you would think it is

00:01:46.842 --> 00:01:48.621
and that's all I was trying to get across
