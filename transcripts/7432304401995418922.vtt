Kicking off the Halloween weekend, right,

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.281
we took our big kids on a Old South carriage tour.

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:06.601
Ghost tour of Charleston. Believe it or not,

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:08.081
me and my husband have never done this,

00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:09.481
and this was the perfect opportunity

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:12.361
and such a fun way to start off our Halloween weekend.

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:13.481
Tour was about 40 minutes,

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:15.401
and we took our big kids, who are 8 and 9.

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:17.481
And honestly, it was perfect for kids.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:19.121
Telling all of the creepy ghost stories

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:21.621
from some of Charleston's most historic buildings.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.020
It was also just a beautiful way to see Charleston all lit up at night.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.360
The kids had such a great time,

00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:27.681
and so did my husband and I.

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.961
I really do think this is going to be a new family tradition.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:33.181
To start off every Halloween weekend. Happy Halloween.
