00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.080
my kids had a really busy weekend working with their dad

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:03.280
so we needed a chill Monday

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:05.320
it's really cloudy outside which makes me tired and puts me in a fight

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:07.200
so when Madison asked to make clothes for her Barbies

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:10.520
I said why the heck not why not start our Monday with a low stress activity

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:12.320
if you've ever done sewing crafts with an 8 year old

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:13.200
you know I'm totally kidding

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.720
there is nothing low stress about a child using a sewing machine

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.040
but she did it failed

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:17.760
and Learned from it

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:19.880
so I will say it was good lessons to learn on a Monday morning

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.040
as for our actual lessons

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:22.880
we can have a pretty low math Learned the N k

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:24.720
constant team and I've been teaching these as word family

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.440
we used the all about reading word cards and sorted them into the word fam

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:29.200
and Madison kinda just did a Hodge podge of thing

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:31.040
she reviewed the contractions we Learned last week

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:33.400
and did a few pages of a grammar and spelling workbook that we just

00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:34.680
she doesn't love doing workbooks

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.400
but I wanna see if it helps her reading fluency

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.480
at this point I'm trying any and all of the things

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:41.214
but she does really enjoy these Little Lions books and that is a win
