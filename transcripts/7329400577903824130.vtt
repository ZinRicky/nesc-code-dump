00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
I meant to go out tonight.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.200
I don't really wanna go out.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.200
I don't really wanna get ready,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.400
but I do need to wash my hair.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.400
I've worn it slicked back for a few days in a row.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.320
And as you can see,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.640
she's not looking that great.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.540
She's looking a little bit greasy.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.120
I think mostly it's product,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.900
but it's probably also a bit dirty.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.560
And then the ends of my hair is super dry.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.400
It's summer here.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.160
I've been swimming.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.200
I've been out in the sun.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.360
And I saw on TikTok

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.520
everybody's going mad for that hair mask for now.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.920
And I've seen a few reviews of this.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.520
And so I ordered some because I wanna try it.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.360
Sorry, I don't have my tripod in here

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.460
and I can't be bothered going to go get it.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.280
It smells really good

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.420
and it's really like very thick,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.680
very viscous.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.440
So I think, you know,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.600
hopefully it should do the trick.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.200
All the instructions are in Japanese

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.000
and unfortunately

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.200
I don't speak Japanese,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.840
but I'm pretty sure a hair mask is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.040
a hair mask is a hair mask.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.820
So I'm just gonna do what I think I should do. Um,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.620
and I'll let you know.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.800
Here we go. I wasn't sure how much to use,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.440
so I just went with a lot,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.440
a disgusting amount.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.880
It is very silky though.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.760
Uh, I don't know if I said the name of the brand.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.600
It's just NATO

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.660
and it cost me $27.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.580
So far I've got high hopes.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.760
Oh, that shower brought me back to life.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.700
I got sent this Dermalogica

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.880
Pro Collagen Banking Serum the other day

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.520
and yet to made a dermalogic product that I don't like

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.260
but this just feels and smells exactly like

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.540
when you get a facial.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.960
Okay, so far so good.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.000
I've just brushed it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.160
Normally my hair gets really,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.800
really naughty,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.360
but it wasn't very naughty

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.480
so that's a good sign.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.800
I was thinking about it when I was using it

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.980
like what product would I compare it to?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.520
Just like a whole lot of hair on my hands.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.080
Thank you. And it reminded me of the Olaplex No. 4.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.080
I think it's No. 4,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.220
the little one.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.640
Um, and that one's quite pricey.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.360
So but under $30 could be a good dupe

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.960
but I won't know until I dry it off.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.960
So give me a minute and I will check back.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.760
Okay, this is how the hair came up.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.400
She's very soft, very silky.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.960
Don't mind me

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.560
looking like two completely different people

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.220
from the start of this video. Alright.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.400
Um, the only thing that I'm worried about is that

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.800
it's so soft and silky

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.840
that these curls are never gonna hold.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.720
Running late as per.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.340
But here is the outfit.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200
I look like I'm off to a funeral,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.560
but I kinda don't hate that

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.120
and I still don't wanna go. Anyway,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.931
have a good day.
