00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
eating liver is not going to cause 

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:02.840
vitamin a toxicity

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:05.051
and the studies done on vitamin a toxicity 

00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:06.440
were done using an isolated

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:08.087
synthetic version in supplement form

00:00:08.088 --> 00:00:09.485
if the supplement bottle does not 

00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:10.917
label it as either beta carotene

00:00:10.918 --> 00:00:12.757
or fish oil it's probably synthetic

00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:14.806
the synthetic version being toxic

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:16.206
being a fat soluble vitamin

00:00:16.207 --> 00:00:17.523
it needs to be accompanied 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.653
by other micronutrients

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:20.460
in order to be properly synthesized 

00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:21.013
by the body

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:23.238
and natural vitamin a really only comes 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:24.534
from animal based sources

00:00:24.535 --> 00:00:25.734
so instead of trying to fill

00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:27.337
the gap in micronutrients with 

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:28.734
a cabinet full of synthetic

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:30.014
isolated supplements

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:30.820
why don't we just simply 

00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:33.234
go to the source and eat food
