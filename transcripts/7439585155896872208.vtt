00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.680
at Christmas time nothing screams

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:02.800
I've got my life together

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.480
quite like the smell of freshly baked 

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:05.320
gingerbread cookies

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:07.178
and you and I both know that I'm barely 

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:08.200
hanging on by a thread

00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:10.699
but the people that are about to arrive at my house

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.680
 must never find out

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:12.520
so instead today

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.374
we're gonna work a little bit of Christmas 

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:15.840
magic with the Circa holiday range

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.880
and I fell in love with this range last Christmas

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:19.920
they've got three beautiful scents to choose from

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.440
and the obvious choice for today is the gingerbread cookies

00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:24.360
it's a warm and inviting scent of ginger

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:27.360
cosy cinnamon and a sweet mix of brown sugar and vanilla

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.840
and hopefully it convinces everyone

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:30.800
that I totally just made this gingerbread 

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:31.640
house from scratch

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:33.320
top it with icing sugar to hide any sins

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:35.760
and if anyone asks I was definitely going for rustic ok

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:36.713
is it pretty?

00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:37.520
 debateable

00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:38.476
but is it edible?

00:00:38.477 --> 00:00:39.320
also debateable

00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:41.363
but does my house smell like Martha Stewart's kitchen 

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:42.120
on Christmas morning?

00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:42.950
pretty sure it does

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:44.366
 before Snoop gets there at least

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:45.440
 I added some Circa minis

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:47.280
which would make super cute festive favours

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.240
and now I cosplay

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:49.844
as somebody who definitely has time to 

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:51.326
make gingerbread houses from scratch
