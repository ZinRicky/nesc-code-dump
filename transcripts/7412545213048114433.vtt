if you're like me and you find yourself craving some 

00:00:02.383 --> 00:00:03.874
tangy juicy sweet and crunchy 

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:04.920
Chinese lemon chicken

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:06.160
then this recipe will

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:07.200
knock your fkn socks off

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:09.440
for my dry ingredients I mixed together plain flour

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:10.880
cornflour salt and pepper

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:12.800
and then I made an egg wash by beating an egg

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:14.680
which really is as simple as it sounds

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.320
then I sliced about three chicken breasts up into cube shapes

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:19.120
before popping them through my egg wash

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:20.600
and dipping them into the flour

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.960
and once you're all evenly coated in the egg and flour mix

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:25.040
I shallow fry them in some really hot oil

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.840
and I find the trick to getting the perfect fry

00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:28.480
is to cook them in smaller batches

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:31.360
and keep them moving until they're golden and crunchy on the outside

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:32.720
and cooked and tender in the middle

00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:35.480
I cooked all the chicken in three batches before setting it aside

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:37.440
and getting started on my lemon chicken sauce

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:39.040
combine lemon juice soy sauce

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:40.080
rice wine vinegar

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.120
water sugar alongside a cornflour slurry

00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:44.383
made from mixing 2 parts boiling water 

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:45.660
with 1 part cornflour

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.340
I cooked it down to let it thicken up 

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:48.960
before adding back in my fried chicken

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:50.789
and I let all those flavours marry together 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.120
over the heat for about a minute

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:53.280
and then it was time to plate up

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:54.800
and I just went really simple with this

00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:56.480
and served it with some plain white rice

00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:58.080
some sauteed wok fried veggies

00:00:58.081 --> 00:00:59.440
sesame seeds and coriander

00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:01.080
even the kids ate it without complaint

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:02.270
and that's how I know it's good
