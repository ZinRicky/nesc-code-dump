00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.280
Donald Trump has been the president before

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.481
with the house and the Senate.

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:06.561
He's appointed Supreme Court justices before.

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:07.801
Like, all this has happened before,

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:09.801
and the world didn't end, you know,

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:11.841
it wasn't. This didn't turn into,

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:13.801
you know, Afghanistan under, like,

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:16.121
Christian leadership. So that's the part I'm not scared at.

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:19.141
It truly is the empowering of his followers.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.960
I think Donald Trump just wants money.

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:23.321
He's gonna do whatever he can to get as much money as he can

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.041
while he's in office. He's very self serving and.

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:26.821
And self whatever.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.500
So I don't think, you know,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.660
it's the people that follow him that are fucking nut jobs that

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.960
now, that's the world I don't like living in,

00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:41.841
because he. Donald Trump is just one person,

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:45.441
but it's all his little people that are so aggressive.

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:47.761
Like, there's no need to be so fucking aggressive.

00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:52.041
There's no need to be so in people's face about something that's like,

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:53.461
so unnecessary.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.440
She conceded, everybody's accepted it.

00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:58.721
We're all just saying like, gosh,

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:00.941
this isn't what I my was hopeful for.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.160
But it's those people that are just so aggressive and in your face.

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:08.141
Them being empowered is what's disappointing

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.880
for the people who didn't vote for him.

00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:14.501
Seeing their close loved ones that did vote for them, like,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.380
you think that's okay,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.260
that's
