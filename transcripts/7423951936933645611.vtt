00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.260
Gisele Pelicot is a hero she fought to make her assaults public

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.560
she wanted the public to look at it straight in the eyes

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.740
I love this shame she said

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.800
must change sides from the victims to the perpetrator

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:19.800
if you're unaware of this Frenchwoman's story

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.120
and the trial that's been ongoing in France

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:25.080
her husband for years drugged her and assaulted her

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:28.880
and then invited over 50 men to come over and do the same

00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:33.440
and he filmed them and she fought to have these videos and photos

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:36.440
shown to everyone in the courtroom

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:39.520
so that the perpetrators would have to sit and shame

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:42.720
while everyone watched what they did

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:45.600
I can't begin to fathom what she has gone through

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:47.360
and what she continues to go through

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:48.760
and then to take it a step further

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:52.040
that through all of this she's still thinking of others

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.680
like has used this as an opportunity

00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:59.260
as she said that to show the world that we can shift shame from

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.560
from the victims to the perpetrators

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.620
as it should be she is my hero
