00:00.080 --> 00:03.100
Today was one of those days. So

00:04.640 --> 00:07.320
we got some takeout today.

00:07.321 --> 00:09.041
Guess what it is. It's Indian food.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.861
We haven't had Indian food.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.880
How long now? Ever since my dad was here

00:12.881 --> 00:14.001
in January, maybe.

00:14.002 --> 00:16.101
Yeah, it's been a while, babe.

00:16.240 --> 00:18.040
It's been a while. I ordered this.

00:18.041 --> 00:20.341
So lucky doesn't even know what's in here.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.040
I need help. I don't even remember what I got for us.

00:25.041 --> 00:26.721
Lucky never orders his own dishes.

00:26.722 --> 00:27.961
I always order for him. I,

00:27.962 --> 00:29.241
I do. When.

00:29.242 --> 00:31.741
When was the last time you ordered your dish?

00:33.560 --> 00:35.040
Most of the time, I don't care.

00:35.041 --> 00:36.041
Yeah, you know what I like.

00:36.042 --> 00:37.021
So you just. Yeah,

00:37.880 --> 00:40.440
easily scan the menu for Lucky's food first,

00:40.441 --> 00:41.881
and then tell him what's good,

00:41.882 --> 00:44.801
what I think he'll like. And nine times out of 10,

00:44.802 --> 00:46.441
that's the case. Ordered him,

00:46.442 --> 00:48.841
I think chicken when? Vindaloo.

00:48.842 --> 00:50.281
I hope that's how you say it.

00:50.282 --> 00:51.681
What's his name? We've been.

00:51.682 --> 00:53.641
Jason from London. Or Jake from London.

00:53.642 --> 00:55.041
Sam from London. Sam from London.

00:55.042 --> 00:57.021
We've been watching Love Island UK.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.240
We. They just got out of the pods.

01:00.241 --> 01:02.121
I'm invested. Lucky isn't. Really.

01:02.122 --> 01:04.181
I also finished house of Dragons.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.040
You finished it? Yes,

01:06.041 --> 01:08.161
but guess what? I'm glad you didn't keep watching,

01:08.162 --> 01:10.161
because the war didn't end up happening.

01:10.162 --> 01:13.881
It cut off in Season 20. Season 3 comes out, like,

01:13.882 --> 01:14.901
in two years.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.480
It was all, like,

01:16.481 --> 01:18.021
wasted my time. Yeah,

01:18.840 --> 01:19.940
we got.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.700
I love you.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.060
Yellow rice, rice.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.480
More rice. Rice.

01:28.481 --> 01:29.941
Three rice. Three

01:32.240 --> 01:35.160
says CS Chicken Samosas. Okay,

01:35.161 --> 01:37.161
I get these every time from this place,

01:37.162 --> 01:40.321
and they're never good. But I'm just hoping that one time

01:40.322 --> 01:42.161
I'm gonna get them and they're actually good.

01:42.162 --> 01:42.961
Okay,

01:44.120 --> 01:47.400
they look pretty decent, but they're always so dry.

01:47.401 --> 01:51.401
They come with this little sweet brown sauce and this,

01:51.402 --> 01:52.981
um, green sauce.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.080
Okay, what's this?

01:54.081 --> 01:54.761
What's this? Oh,

01:54.762 --> 01:57.361
I got this for you as a little surprise, friend.

01:57.362 --> 01:59.761
Bless your soul. That looks pretty good.

01:59.762 --> 02:02.001
That looks good. This is Lucky's.

02:02.002 --> 02:05.061
She loves her lunch. I got chicken vindaloo,

02:05.480 --> 02:07.940
and then chicken vindaloo.

02:08.520 --> 02:14.260
I got lentil doll. I always get this one. What are we gonna do?

02:18.640 --> 02:19.700
Little taste test.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.620
Hmm. This is good today.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.060
It's always a hit or miss with this Indian place.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.680
I also got lucky spicy in mine. Medium.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.701
Mine isn't spicy at all. You never know what you're gonna get.

02:30.920 --> 02:33.000
Hmm. Is it good?

02:33.001 --> 02:35.261
It's not spicy. I'm so sorry.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.960
Okay, this is my plate,

02:38.961 --> 02:40.901
and then this is Lucky's plate.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.960
We also got two different breads.

02:42.961 --> 02:44.481
Really? Remember what I got

02:44.482 --> 02:46.081
to be honest, but I got this bread.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.661
Also got some garlic naan.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.160
These aren't chicken samosas.

02:50.161 --> 02:51.061
They're lamb.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.880
Second of all, they're still dry.

02:53.881 --> 02:56.281
But I'm just gonna drown them in sauce.

02:56.282 --> 02:58.121
But we're gonna eat like he is pacing.

02:58.122 --> 02:59.861
Ready to get the show started.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.049
This is what we got today.
