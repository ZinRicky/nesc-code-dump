00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.800
I think this is a really important time for us to revisit the crunchy to

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:04.920
all right pipeline

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:06.280
and I made this video like

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:11.440
a year ago talking about how the super far right and the super crunchy have this

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:13.400
like place of meeting

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:15.160
you're seeing it with the people who are really

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:17.600
really excited about like deregulation

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.660
about RFK's commitment to like

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.000
redoing the food system because there is a very specific type of like

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.200
crunchy Mama loves Jesus

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:34.040
doesn't believe in shoes drinks raw milk but votes red type of crunchy parent is

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:37.040
a lot of these crunchy views are based in the distrust of the government

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:38.920
and they're based in the idea of like

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:41.720
health and purity antitox

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:42.920
whatever you wanna call it

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:46.640
although in small doses those things are healthy and good for you

00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:48.640
reading labels making sure you have like

00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:52.120
an 80 20 diet checking the sources of your meats

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:55.760
looking into the food industry as something that I did as like

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:57.600
a very niche hyperfixation

00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:01.320
but it can lead you to a place of not trusting medical professionals

00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:04.120
it can lead you to a place of not trusting the government in general

00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:05.040
and that can lead you down

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:08.480
a place to believing somebody who tells you that everyone's lying

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:10.360
I'm the one that you can believe

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:12.580
and when you look at purity

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.100
when you become obsessed with purity

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.940
you are on a slippery slope to eugenics

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.440
you can also see this kind of popping up in this like

00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.760
pro birther movement where these people who are like no

00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:26.080
I'm wealthy and have really good genetics

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:27.940
I should have more children

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.200
all stems from the same place

00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:32.440
and in a weird dichotomy these like

00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:37.640
people who seem like super duper hippies are gonna be won over by the right

00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:42.000
because where the right is interested in the purity of society

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.760
which already has its own negative implications

00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:47.800
these super crunchy people who are on this like

00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:51.080
crunchy Mama mode are worried about like

00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.440
personal health impurity and it's not a far leap

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:55.720
like it's not a far jump

00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:58.740
those are those are little islands on the same

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.840
on the same wavelength you might start with buying half a cow

00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:05.640
and getting a doterra essential oils packet

00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:08.020
but you may end up an anti vax

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.580
pro fascist government supporter

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.820
not everyone

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.380
but it's there
