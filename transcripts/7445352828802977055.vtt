00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
I mean,

00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:06.161
I can guarantee that they will do their best to not give you peace.

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:09.501
As you can see, my eyes are swollen cause I've been crying this morning

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.860
because, um.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.840
For the five years I've been divorced,

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:16.481
I've spent those five years still in the family court system,

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.341
still battling everything.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.060
Um, he.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.540
Anyway, um.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.960
But that's not to say you get no peace.

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:30.161
I still have 100% peace when he's not in my life.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:34.321
And I still don't have to touch his disgusting fucking body.

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:37.501
I don't have to see his disgusting fucking face.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.480
Like, there's so many peaceful things in your life that.

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:46.261
That's why they try to throw the little bit of shit at you and like,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.480
try to make your life shitty in other ways.

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.561
But the. It's only in that one little way.

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:56.961
Like right now you have no peace in your whole entire life,

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:58.641
because he is, you know,

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:01.241
woven into every bit in peace of your life.

00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:03.721
But when you leave now,

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:06.921
he's minimized to just the tiny little part that he can fuck with you

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:08.301
and as. And then

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.960
you just have to make sure

00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.641
that you take full control of everything else in your life.

00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:14.061
Do you know what I mean? Like, sure, motherfucker,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.480
drag me through family court.

00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.081
That's the only little bit you're gonna get.

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:20.221
Cause I'm gonna make sure that every other moment of my life

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.260
is filled with so much peace and happiness.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.080
I win! I fucking win.

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:29.621
It's my life. I decide what I do with it, when.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.640
When I do those things and how I do it.

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:33.061
Do you know what I mean? So,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.800
like, yes,

00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:37.641
they are gonna try to do everything they can

00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:38.601
to try to make you miserable

00:01:38.602 --> 00:01:40.421
and not allow you that peace.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.160
But you didn't leave for nothing.

00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:44.881
Do you know what I mean? You'll find that peace.

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:46.901
You'll have that peace and you'll have that happiness.
