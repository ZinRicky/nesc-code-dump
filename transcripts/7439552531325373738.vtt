00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
Have you ever wondered if there was a secret to make eggs easy to peel?

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.320
If when you peel your eggs

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:07.801
you're taking more chunk of egg white off than you are shell,

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:11.321
then please listen. It doesn't really matter what type of egg you have.

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:13.341
If it's a chicken egg, a duck egg,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.920
the colour of the egg and the thickness of the shell

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:17.601
also really doesn't make much difference.

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:19.281
You can put salt in when you're boiling.

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:21.361
You can boil for a short time or a long time.

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:24.741
You can also put your eggs in an ice bath after you boil them.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.360
You might have already come across the secret to easily peeling eggs

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.761
without even realising it.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.681
Have you ever peeled eggs and you felt wow,

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:33.641
this is really easy to peel eggs this time?

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.841
And then other times it just feels like an endless task

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:37.241
that's just not gonna work out.

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:38.561
So for this holiday season,

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:39.721
if you're making deviled eggs

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:42.981
and you really just want it that shell just to slide off perfectly,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.000
then use old eggs. Now don't use expired eggs,

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.181
just use eggs that are older.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.000
Fresh eggs just how the chickens.

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.721
But is not gonna peel well when hard boiled.

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:54.041
Now

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:57.361
most eggs that you get from the grocery store a few weeks old anyway.

00:00:57.362 --> 00:00:59.721
Just use the oldest eggs you have this holiday season

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:02.501
and I promise you you will have an easy peeled egg.
