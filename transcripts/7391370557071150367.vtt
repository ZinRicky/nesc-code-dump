Just a few weeks ago, the Huffington Post published this article.

00:05.120 --> 00:05.720
Yeah, um,

00:05.721 --> 00:09.581
I really don't care to hear another leftist media organization

00:09.760 --> 00:12.740
whine about anybody inciting violence

00:12.880 --> 00:16.880
ever again. These are the same people who condemn stochastic terrorism,

00:16.881 --> 00:19.721
think so many different types of speech should be banned,

00:19.722 --> 00:22.921
should be illegal. They don't even play by their own rules.

00:22.922 --> 00:25.681
And for a while, I think a lot of Americans just didn't really care.

00:25.682 --> 00:26.681
I think we figured, well,

00:26.682 --> 00:29.001
these news organizations have been around for so long,

00:29.002 --> 00:30.121
like, they must be credible.

00:30.122 --> 00:32.241
But now it's like we're not falling for it anymore.

00:32.242 --> 00:33.561
You people are hypocrites.

00:33.562 --> 00:35.201
This kind of divisiveness,

00:35.202 --> 00:38.241
this kind of hypocrisy is not journalism.

00:38.242 --> 00:43.681
You have these celebrities enacting violent acts towards Donald Trump,

00:43.682 --> 00:45.841
but it. It doesn't count because as Donald Trump.

00:45.842 --> 00:49.601
Right, but anybody else would be put into prison for what, say,

00:49.602 --> 00:51.481
Kathy Griffin did few years ago.

00:51.482 --> 00:52.921
Nobody should play by their rules anymore,

00:52.922 --> 00:54.641
because they don't even play by them.

00:54.642 --> 00:56.481
They have zero credibility,

00:56.482 --> 00:58.301
because according to their own standards,

00:58.320 --> 01:00.780
they incite violence and they don't care.
