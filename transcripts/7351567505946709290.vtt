00:00.080 --> 00:01.720
If we were a serious society,

00:01.721 --> 00:04.481
we would have far harsher punishments for people who hurt children.

00:04.482 --> 00:07.861
Like, I'm reading all these details of the Ruby Frankie case,

00:07.880 --> 00:09.120
and I want to scream,

00:09.121 --> 00:11.381
this woman abused her own children.

00:11.560 --> 00:12.240
Just, like,

00:12.241 --> 00:13.401
literal torture.

00:13.402 --> 00:14.241
And she pleaded guilty.

00:14.242 --> 00:15.561
Like, she's guilty.

00:15.562 --> 00:16.441
Not like we're questioning, like,

00:16.442 --> 00:18.041
what, did she do it or not?

00:18.042 --> 00:18.761
You know, we don't know.

00:18.762 --> 00:19.201
We need to, like,

00:19.202 --> 00:19.841
go easy on her.

00:19.842 --> 00:20.601
No, like, she's.

00:20.602 --> 00:21.421
She's guilty.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.120
And in the state of Utah,

00:23.121 --> 00:24.101
the maximum

00:24.280 --> 00:27.900
amount of prison time she can possibly do for horrific child abuse

00:28.120 --> 00:29.080
is 30 years.

00:29.081 --> 00:32.161
And rarely do these types of people get the maximum sentences. Right?

00:32.162 --> 00:34.001
So she'll probably walk away in a few years.

00:34.002 --> 00:38.181
Absolutely destroyed the lives of children,

00:38.240 --> 00:40.600
and we literally give her a slap on the wrist, and it's like,

00:40.601 --> 00:41.681
try harder next time.

00:41.682 --> 00:43.021
We'll give you another chance.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.120
Why. Why do we do this?

00:44.121 --> 00:47.321
You hear about this all the time in every single state,

00:47.322 --> 00:49.241
people who do horrific things to children,

00:49.242 --> 00:50.081
and they get, like,

00:50.082 --> 00:51.601
30 years, maximum,

00:51.602 --> 00:54.061
10 years a year.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.000
What are we doing?

00:55.001 --> 00:56.681
If you are someone who hurts a child,

00:56.682 --> 00:58.641
you should not see daylight again.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.021
You should be put in jail.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.200
End of story, end of conversation.

01:02.201 --> 01:04.201
Like, our society has too many problems.

01:04.202 --> 01:05.681
We don't need to deal with you, too.

01:05.682 --> 01:07.701
So if you prove that you're that kind of person,

01:07.840 --> 01:08.960
it should be goodbye.

01:08.961 --> 01:09.641
Like, you're.

01:09.642 --> 01:11.561
You're done. You don't get another chance.

01:11.562 --> 01:14.881
You don't get another opportunity to do something like that again.

01:14.882 --> 01:17.681
You're done. And this should just be an easy one for politicians,

01:17.682 --> 01:20.241
right? Because we all seem to agree on this.

01:20.242 --> 01:22.201
Like, it doesn't matter if you're conservative,

01:22.202 --> 01:23.241
if you're a Liberal,

01:23.242 --> 01:24.441
it doesn't matter how old you are.

01:24.442 --> 01:27.321
We all seem to agree that we all hate child abusers.

01:27.322 --> 01:31.001
This is one thing that we actually all seem to agree on.

01:31.002 --> 01:32.121
So if you're a politician,

01:32.122 --> 01:34.321
like, why isn't this your main focus?

01:34.322 --> 01:34.961
Like, first of all,

01:34.962 --> 01:37.361
because I know politicians want votes and want money and stuff.

01:37.362 --> 01:38.801
This seems like a popular take.

01:38.802 --> 01:42.361
Like, it seems popular to punish child abusers more severely

01:42.362 --> 01:46.041
and to create laws that allow for more than 30 years.

01:46.042 --> 01:47.281
So not only is it popular,

01:47.282 --> 01:50.641
but it should also be the most important thing to you.

01:50.642 --> 01:53.021
I can't think of any other political issue

01:53.280 --> 01:55.620
that is more important than protecting children.
