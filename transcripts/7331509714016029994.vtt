00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.080
How is courtship different from dating so commonly?

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.960
Dating does not usually have marriage in mind,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.560
but it's usually very recreational.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.760
People will date for years without getting engaged,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.980
or they'll date multiple people, etc.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.120
Most of the time

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.520
casual dating leads to hookups as well.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.240
It tends to be very emotionally based

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.680
and infatuation is usually

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.340
the factor that leads people to date.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.280
Intentional dating is different from casual dating.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.860
Intentional dating is what most Christians do.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.040
Marriage is the end goal

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.880
and the couple spends the time getting to know

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.280
each other more seriously while dating each other,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.920
but often date

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.280
for a short amount of time before getting married

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.040
and there will usually be agreed upon

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.100
physical boundaries.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.840
Courtship is different from both of these.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.060
Courtship is usually more family centered.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.080
The couple is often set up by the parents

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.680
and often doesn't go on dates.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.800
For me we spent most of our time together

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.440
hanging out at my parents house.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.520
The couple does go on dates,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.740
so usually chaperone.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.760
The couple usually does not spend um

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.360
time alone together before engagement

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.020
for accountability purposes.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.000
There's usually stricter physical boundaries.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.400
For example,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.640
my husband and I didn't touch until we were engaged.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.960
There's also greater emphasis on

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.920
getting to know each other.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.260
I'm on a deep level

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.140
then spending time going on dates.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.120
Most of our courtship we spent emailing

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.520
each other back and forth about our beliefs on theology,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.060
marriage, the family, etc.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.360
Decisions are made Logically.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.400
And there is very little emphasis on

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.440
the romantic side of things before engagement,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.140
so do not skew decisions.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.360
There's a summary in the caption,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.960
but once again,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.760
let me know your questions

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.340
and I'll do my best to answer soon.
