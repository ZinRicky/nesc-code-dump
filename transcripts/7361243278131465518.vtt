00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.480
Today is my husband's 40th birthday

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:05.281
and I wanted to surprise him with an Oreo cookie chocolate pie

00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:06.721
since Oreos are his favourite,

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:07.881
so that's what I did.

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:10.601
Obviously I needed to fuel myself with a smoothie lunch

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:14.481
and use this opportunity to take my animal based prenatal vitamins.

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:16.521
Love that these have real ingredients from the land

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:18.321
like regeneratively farmed beef liver,

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:21.361
so I can trust I'm preparing my body for optimal fertility.

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:23.921
I started by making my Oreo cookie crust.

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:27.321
I only sweeten this cookie crust with 1/4 cup of low glycemic

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:28.341
coconut sugar

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.360
and then I rolled it out as thin as I could

00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:32.401
between two sheets of Parchment paper.

00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:33.241
While that baked,

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:36.481
I made some chocolate from scratch from my chocolate pie filling.

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:40.041
I made one bar and left the remaining 7 ounces in liquid form.

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:41.721
After whipping up some raw cream,

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:43.641
I got to making the rest of the filling.

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:47.681
I whisked this over a double broiler until it reached 160 degrees.

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:48.401
While that cooled,

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:51.161
I crumbled up the Oreo cookie into Oreo crumbs

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:53.061
to create a cookie pie crust.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.640
I used the back of a measuring

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:57.321
cup to shape a huge amount of the crumbs into a pie dish

00:00:57.322 --> 00:00:59.981
since I really love a big crust and hate when they're skimpy.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.680
I baked the crust for 20 minutes

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.680
finished the filling by whipping my chocolate mixture with creamed

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:06.961
butter and then folding in the whipped cream.

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:09.721
The final pie came together in just A few minutes

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:10.361
and I finished

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.241
by shaving the homemade chocolate bar with a vegetable peeler

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:14.801
for the final pie decoration.

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:16.461
My husband was obsessed.
