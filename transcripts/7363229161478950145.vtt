Not to sound like really stupid,

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:03.801
but is the Boston Marathon longer than the LA Marathon?

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:05.501
No. All marathons at the same length.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.800
That's like common sense, I fear.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.581
Are you serious? I'm serious.
