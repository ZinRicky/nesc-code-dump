00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.440
“You should know what I want without me having to ask”

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:05.240
probably said it or you've probably had it told to you

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:07.214
But that kind of falls under the Assumption 

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.740
that your partner is a mind reader

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.880
As far as I know

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:12.600
no one can do or no one is a mind reader

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.840
They just can't, that's just not how humans work

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:19.000
maybe with advanced technology and AI one day that could be a possibility

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.280
but as of right now

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.040
it's not possible

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.880
if you want your partner to do a specific thing for you

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.200
You have to lay it out for them

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:27.499
you have to explain to them and communicate

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.280
 that's why if you want your partner to do something

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:31.800
you have to ask for it

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:33.640
not only is it okay to ask

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:37.640
you have to ask more than half the time because we are not AI

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.600
they can't read your mind

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.200
The way everyone learns is through communication

00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:42.720
saying hey

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:46.285
I'd really like if you took out the garbage before it got overfilled 

00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:50.440
hey, I'd like if you cooked my favorite meal for me every once in a while to surprise me

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:51.380
or hey

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.440
spending one on one time together is really important to me

00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:55.680
I'd like if we did more of that

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:56.720
whatever it is

00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:59.200
you have to be willing to lay it out for them

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:03.440
You have to be willing to open up and express your desires directly

00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:07.000
Then you can actually often get to a place where it's like yeah

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.360
I know what you want and you know without me explaining

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.160
but it doesn't start there

00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:12.280
anybody who is there

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:15.600
probably started with a ton of communicate about what they need from each other

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:16.600
it's as simple as that

00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:17.492
communication
