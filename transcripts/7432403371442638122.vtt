00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.760
hey guys

00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:03.780
so I talk about abortion every day

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.000
often on this app and I find that people have a hard time grasping or like

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.440
believing me when I talk about the dangers of the fetal personhood movement

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:16.720
which is conservatives movement to give fetuses constitutional rights

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:19.640
equal to the woman or anyone else walking around

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:21.200
I'm just putting this comments out here

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:24.360
remind you guys that these people exist

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:25.040
they're trying to like

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.920
create this alternate reality

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:31.680
and convince people that it's not really a woman growing a fetus with her body

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:37.040
it's not her body it's this completely independent human being that just like

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:38.800
happens to be inside of her

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:41.640
we should talk about the dangers of the fetal personhood movement right

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:45.280
like you will see pregnancy criminalization levels that you've never seen

00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:49.060
we're already seeing stories of people being criminalized for their miscarriage

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.760
because states are saying

00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:52.360
what wasn't actually a miscarriage

00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:54.200
we think it was a self induced abortion

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:56.120
consider addicts who get pregnant right

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:57.480
so right now you know

00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:00.120
we want we don't want to criminalize addicts who get pregnant

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:01.800
because we want them to go to the doctor

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:03.380
we want them to seek help

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.880
obviously they won't do that

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:07.260
because if you're an addict and you get pregnant

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.760
you will know that you're not only facing potential negligence charges

00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:12.840
but you might even be facing murder charges

00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:13.360
which again

00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:14.840
they won't seek medical care

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.440
so it will have disastrous health outcomes for everyone

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:18.960
involved certainly not hope

00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:19.760
the fetus

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.600
I don't see where pregnancy criminalization in a fetal personhood world ends

00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:24.600
so I mean

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:27.080
you could be doing anything maybe um

00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:29.120
you harm your fetus because you were texting and driving

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.000
and you got in an accident where um

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:35.760
you had a bad diet like you did anything that harmed the fetus

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:39.160
you're potentially facing jail time now and again

00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:41.200
we are already seeing this

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:44.220
please vote blue in the selection
