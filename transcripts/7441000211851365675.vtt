00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.580
Our public health system really is a disaster.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.100
A hundred years ago, there was almost no chronic disease

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.380
over 20 years span. No increase in calories,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.200
moderate increase in exercise.

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:18.361
And yet obesity rates 30% to 42%.

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:22.041
So there has to be something else in the environment.

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:24.641
It's in almost all processed foods.

00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:28.001
They're being recommended by our public health authorities

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.181
in ever increasing amounts.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.560
And with that has come this explosion of overweight,

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:36.181
obesity and chronic disease.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.040
This science is not unknown,

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:41.141
it has just been silenced.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.400
It's making us sick and people are not aware of it.

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:50.461
What we're being told to eat is at the heart of our problem.
