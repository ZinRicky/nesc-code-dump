00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.120
So actually, I'm not white,

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:04.461
so calm yourself down.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.520
The reason, the way that I came to this conclusion

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:10.881
was in researching my own culture and my own history

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:12.341
and my own privilege.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.080
I realized what I did was wrong in going on a mission trip to Fiji

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:17.361
because I am Puerto Rican.

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:21.601
My mother and my father are both 100% from Puerto Rico,

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:25.221
the island. Their parents are both from Puerto Rico.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.000
But I was very confused at why do I look so white?

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:29.081
Why do I look so American?

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:31.081
I've passed for white my entire life.

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:32.941
I get all kinds of white privilege,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.800
and I get to kind of pop in and out of my white privilege

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.261
or my not white privilege.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.280
And in growing up and learning

00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:43.761
and evolving and deconstructing my faith,

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:48.841
I realized the reason I look the way I look is because of colonialism.

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:53.641
Because of white Europeans from Spain settling in Puerto Rico,

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:58.161
mating and having children with the Taino Indians that live there.

00:00:58.162 --> 00:00:59.921
That's why I look the way I look.

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:01.781
I have the high cheekbones,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.280
but I also have the really light skin.

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:05.001
But I have dark hair and dark eyes,

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:06.041
but olive tone,

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:07.681
not like pink undertones.

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:10.961
Like, I've always been very confused at why do I look the way I look.

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:13.461
I'm ostracized from my Latina,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.120
you know, people,

00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:17.881
but then the white people don't accept me either.

00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:18.481
So

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:24.321
once I started to look into my own culture and Why I am the way I am,

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:28.081
I Learned. And now I gave an apology to Fiji,

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:30.421
and I actually did look up some of their culture.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.940
It was one of the most meaningful trips to me I still have.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.800
I still,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.360
uh, I.

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:39.521
I didn't wanna mispronounce any of the words.

00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:40.961
I realized they don't do a haka.

00:01:40.962 --> 00:01:43.001
What they do. It's spelled C I B I.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.441
I don't really know how to pronounce it.

00:01:44.442 --> 00:01:46.281
I didn't wanna be further disrespectful,

00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:48.601
so I didn't wanna act like I know anything.

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:50.221
All I wanted to do

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.180
and what I will continue to do

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.400
is apologize to the nation of Fiji

00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:58.001
and anybody that I try to convert that.

00:01:58.002 --> 00:01:58.481
You know what I mean?

00:01:58.482 --> 00:02:00.081
That's not my fucking place.

00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:01.541
Your spirituality,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.960
your culture, your faith,

00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:04.481
all that shit is very personal.

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:06.741
And it's not anybody's job to be

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.120
proselyphizing and trying to change people's mind.

00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:14.881
Like, let them come to that decision on their own and. Yeah,

00:02:14.882 --> 00:02:15.601
so chill the fuck out.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:16.421
I'm not white.
