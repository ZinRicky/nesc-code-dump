00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
When I went to visit my mother the last time,

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:06.201
she politely told me I had a mustache.

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:06.681
And I was like, no,

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:09.561
the fuck I don't. And I don't.

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:14.001
What it is, is I have fucking sun damage that creates, like,

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.181
little brown spots, like, right there and there.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.240
So now I take being in the sun serious.

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.401
And look at this cute hat I got.

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:23.501
It's almost like a visor.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.460
And then you put it on,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.320
and that way you can, like,

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:28.361
have your hair up. You. Also,

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:32.461
your head doesn't get all fucking hot and shit and, like, cute.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.140
So that hopefully my mustache doesn't get any worse.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.540
Gotta love a mom. Gotta love her.
