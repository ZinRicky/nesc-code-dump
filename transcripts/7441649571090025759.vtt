00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.920
The problem with staying for the kids

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:04.641
is that it tricks them into thinking their home life is normal.

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:05.961
At least I had my mom and dad.

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:08.281
As if divorce automatically equals absent parent.

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:09.961
Because if someone was going to be a deadbeat,

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:11.241
they already are.

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:14.261
It reflects in their passion for parenting and the marriage.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.880
You're either giving your all to your kids,

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.321
or you're giving them what's left over

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:18.841
after you've catered to the person

00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:20.921
that you don't even seem to like anymore.

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:25.421
So remind me again, who is it exactly that you're staying for?
