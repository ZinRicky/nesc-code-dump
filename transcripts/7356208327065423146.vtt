00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.060
So lately, my son's behavior has been triggering my husband big time.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.060
Not this one. The big one.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.280
And both of our kids act out in very different ways.

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:12.481
My daughter tends to go to anger and rage and tantrums,

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:15.461
and my son tends to crumble and cry.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.520
And when that happens,

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:18.661
my husband loses his mind.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.460
Extremely triggered.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.740
So today I started talking to him about why that might be,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.820
and it turns out he used to act the same way as a kid,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.880
but he wasn't allowed to feel or express those emotions,

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:31.121
and his mom worked all the time,

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:33.741
so he was left to deal with those feelings all by himself.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.840
So it's just a good reminder to remember

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.980
if your kid is acting in a way that is especially triggering for you,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.340
you've got to look at yourself

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.660
and start to deconstruct why

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.540
that might bother you more than other things.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.480
Because it usually will come back to an issue

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:52.301
that you have not resolved from your childhood.
