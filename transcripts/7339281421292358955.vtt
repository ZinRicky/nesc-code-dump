00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.960
Let's make honey

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.720
cinnamon butter.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.520
I have my local milk that I bought from the local farm

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.720
not very far from my house.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.520
And you can see the separation between the milk

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.160
and the cream.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.780
We're gonna remove the cream and make the butter.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.160
Let me show you the consistency of it right now.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.860
So it's solidly whipped cream,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.640
and it still has several more minutes to go to.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.960
About 10 minutes of it already whipping,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.060
so it takes a while for it to get there.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.540
Add a few shakes of salt. Cinnamon.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.340
Raw honey.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.740
Oh, my gosh. Better than Texas Roadhouse.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.480
I think now it's time to make biscuits

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.606
to go with my butter.
