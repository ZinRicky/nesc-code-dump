Okay. Just made butter,

00:02.121 --> 00:02.941
you guys.

00:03.520 --> 00:04.760
This is the buttermilk.

00:04.761 --> 00:06.021
So buttermilk,

00:06.600 --> 00:08.820
all the butter fat separates

00:10.080 --> 00:12.580
leftover from the cream, is called buttermilk.

00:13.080 --> 00:13.960
And it's so good.

This is very light

00:28.322 --> 00:31.121

00:35.200 --> 00:37.540

00:44.080 --> 00:47.500
