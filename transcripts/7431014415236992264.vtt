00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.840
most important thing in people's lives

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:05.320
and their greatest accomplishment should not be their children

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:10.040
Chloe and I agree but let's talk about why the idea that especially for women

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:13.700
your greatest accomplishment in life should be your children is outdated

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.360
my mom raised me to know that she was a woman first and a mother second

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:19.240
she would tell me

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:23.140
you're not my greatest achievement never mess me up or offended me

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.080
I understood that she was just tryna raise us girls to understand that

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:29.720
even if we didn't have children

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:35.480
we weren't missing out we weren't not fulfilling our best selves or not

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:38.880
we we weren't purposeless that we could go and do anything

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:41.400
and having children might be one of those things

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:44.400
might be one really amazing thing and it might not be

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:46.800
and she never wanted us to feel limited

00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:50.240
but that's what that kind of sentiment does it does limit women

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:52.560
I'm gonna explain why I'm Doctor Zoe

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.360
I have a PhD in feminism and I really wanna talk about this

00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:58.000
women are expected

00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:02.020
to say that having children is their biggest accomplishment in life

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.240
and we have these Women's weekends every year in my family

00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:07.320
and the women like share their biggest accomplishments

00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:10.980
we do cards we do like d and m's and the women always say like

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.640
my biggest accomplishment's my children my mom's always said like

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:18.140
mine isn't and everyone in the room's always kind of a bit like

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.100
did you really say that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.940
especially back in the day

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.840
you know it was a shocking thing to say

00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:25.840
but what is an amazing profound experience

00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:27.300
I imagine I mean

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.040
I have my fur baby so I can imagine uh

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:31.560
it is not the Beal and endor

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:32.320
but people

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:35.360
rarely tell men that their greatest accomplishment in life should be

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:40.100
having a child has anyone ever asked you if your greatest accomplishment in life

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.460
should be having a child no

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.580
ha ha

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.400
when we continue to normalise this statement

00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:51.080
what we're doing is perpetuating this limited idea of womanhood

00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.000
that unless you do experience being a mother

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.520
that you will not achieve your biggest uh

00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:00.840
I guess you won't be a fulfilled

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:05.180
complete person do you feel like you were your mom's greatest achievement

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.520
no

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.020
are you offended by the content of this TikTok as a man

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.880
no

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.840
no
