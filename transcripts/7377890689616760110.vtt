00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Let's clean my nasty cast iron pan.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.440
This has been sitting out since last night's dinner

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.721
and the food is very dried out and crusty.

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:08.481
And it's time to get it nice and shiny again.

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:10.421
I will start with some hot running water.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.940
This is gonna soften up the food and make it easier to wash off.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.920
To clean the pans, I like to use this lodge scrubber.

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:21.641
It's chain mail with a silicone something in the middle

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:24.661
which doesn't retain any bacteria so it never smells.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.960
And I can just throw it in the dishwasher.

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:27.521
And I think it's getting kinda grubby.

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:31.841
I'm gonna rinse out the pan several times to get any loose food off.

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:33.081
And turn the temperature down

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:34.881
because it's way too hot for my hands right now.

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:36.361
Then I wanna get to scrub in this part.

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:37.041
It's just obvious.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:37.841
You just scrub,

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:38.201
scrub, scrub,

00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:39.481
scrub the dirty food off.

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:40.761
There's no way around this.

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:41.561
It's a dirty pan,

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:42.781
it needs to be cleaned.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.880
I'll then go for a few rounds of rinsing.

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:46.761
I'm gonna try and rinse off any loose food

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:49.521
and make sure any spot that I miss,

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:51.241
I'm gonna continue to go back over.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:53.281
This process only takes about 30 seconds.

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:57.321
It's really not long. And the scrubber chainmail thing does a great job.

00:00:57.322 --> 00:00:58.401
I'm gonna rinse the back

00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:01.201
cause I don't wanna have any food stuck to the back or extra grease

00:01:01.202 --> 00:01:02.801
cause then that creates a carbon buildup.

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:04.261
If you keep Light in the bottom

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.840
and food builds up on it and it just gets nasty.

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.761
Then we're gonna head over to the stove and get this dry.

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:11.801
This pan needs to be completely bone dry

00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:13.561
before we can put any oil on her.

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:16.281
So I'm gonna make a heat and use a paper towel to dry.

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:18.741
Then I'm gonna coat her with some avocado oil.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.640
I use this instead of olive oil because it doesn't smoke as much.

00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:26.061
Um, olive oil smokes at a lower heat point than avocado oil.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.680
I've used coconut oil in the past, and if I have coconut oil,

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:29.521
I will use that,

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.321
but my favourite is avocado oil.

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:33.201
I'm gonna let her sit here and get real hot.

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:34.161
Then when she's colder,

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:36.021
she's gonna hang out with the rest of her friends.
