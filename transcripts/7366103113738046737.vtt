00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.760
four boys at a Melbourne private school

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:04.921
have been suspended for ranking their female classmates appearances

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:09.681
and using proof that spending $30,000 a year on your son's education

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:13.521
is not gonna ensure that he doesn't go and 🍇 somebody

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:16.281
so people are always on at me about like

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.201
why do you talk about sexist language

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:19.921
like this doesn't actually matter

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:21.541
like all of that type of thing

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.640
and this is some evidence

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:28.941
these year 11 student boys were ranking the girls in their class on a scale

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.680
a scale from wifey to unwrapable

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:37.401
you know how I often talk about the way that um

00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:42.341
patriarchy and many men like to categorise women into like

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.220
down towards God's place

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.840
Madonna or wife or good woman

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:52.481
bad woman well um

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:53.441
to these guys credit

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:57.961
they've actually created more of a spectrum approach from wifey to cutie

00:00:57.962 --> 00:01:02.961
to objects to get out to un 🍇 able

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.921
these boys are 17 and they're not only using the word 🍇 

00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:13.241
they're describing women as whether they would enact 🍇 on them or not

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:18.421
and if you think that this doesn't actually lead to actual sexual assault

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.000
then you are much mistaken

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:27.281
this is exactly the type of language that normalises sa as a joke

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:31.421
a light hearted thing or something that you're entitled to as a man

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.820
and in a society where it's normalised or culture where it's normalised

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.320
it happens for those of you who say oh

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:43.021
objectification that doesn't happen

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.900
they literally are describing women as object

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.720
there is an Excel spreadsheet with the word object in it

00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:51.801
and they're literally describing girls

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:55.241
I shouldn't say women these are girls as objects

00:01:55.242 --> 00:01:56.641
get out as an interesting one too

00:01:56.642 --> 00:02:00.221
I mean it's just like you're not worth it because you're not hot enough

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.880
I don't want you in my line of vision

00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:03.781
you don't deserve to be here at school

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.560
get out of my sight and then the wifey one is interesting

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:09.781
it's like this woman is wife material

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.600
so I hate that term I hate this type of categorisation of women

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.461
it completely supports and props up 🍇 culture

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.420
and it completely undermines consent and respect

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.560
and this is the type of culture that we're talking about

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:28.541
that starts at a really young age

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.600
that leads to sv becoming normalised accepted

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:37.631
tolerated in society by everyone
