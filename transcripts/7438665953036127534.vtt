00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.600
I wanna further the deep dive into the crunchy to crazy pipeline

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.760
and why the conspiracy theory is so dangerous

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:10.280
and why it depends on the mental illness of mothers

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:13.620
and how that ties into my fears about RFK's appointment

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.680
I'm coming from this not from a place of judgement

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.160
I'm coming from a place of experience

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.640
because there is a point in time

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:22.680
where I was heavily influenced by crunchy tendencies

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.840
I started a homeopathic remedy kit

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:28.800
I took colloidal silver I had Mullen garlic

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:31.640
I started preparing homemade everything down to

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:33.200
like elderberry gummies

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.320
and I got an air popper

00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:37.280
because microwave popcorn was full of cancerous carcinogens

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:39.400
tried to import as many things as I could

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:42.760
because I had read way too much about the industrialized farming

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:45.240
and the industrialized food industry here in the United States

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.280
they've always said that there is a good point

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.980
there is a spectrum

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.480
to being concerned and proactive about what you put in your body

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:56.520
and obviously this sort of specialized diet conversation

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.560
does not go for people who have food sensitivities

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:02.860
or food intolerances or require a specialized diet

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.600
what I'm talking about is that there are those of us

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:08.000
who get so hooked in the anxiety of it

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.040
that it goes to an unhealthy place

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:12.900
and how I recognize that I was an unhealthy place

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.320
could potentially help somebody

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:17.780
if you're on that path because I developed what is called orthorexia

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.200
and that is when you are so concerned

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:24.080
about unsafe or eating only clean foods

00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:26.040
that it becomes an obsession

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.440
it becomes a level of mental illness

00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:30.540
and it becomes really really unhealthy

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.640
so how to tell if you're in a unhealthy eating place

00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:36.320
as far as your crunchy tendencies

00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:40.100
one you cannot socialize or go over to other people's houses to eat

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.720
cause you're worried about there not being any safe foods for you to eat

00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:45.880
if you don't think your kid can go to a kid's birthday

00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:49.160
because they may or may not have pizza and a cupcake at that birthday

00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:51.560
and that that would cause too much harm for your child

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.640
if you believe any medical intervention

00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.900
is going to negatively impact the health and safety of your child

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.380
those are top three

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.480
because people like RFK and people who are in this country community

00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:03.720
people selling um dotera

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:05.200
people selling the essential oil things

00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:08.320
are benefiting and capitalizing on your fear

00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:12.320
and that fear can go from a normal place that keeps you safe and healthy

00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:14.200
and making informed choices

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:15.400
to an unsafe place

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:19.460
that completely impacts not only how you view the medical community

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.960
our food system our government

00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:23.640
and then ultimately other groups of people

00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:26.320
cause it depends on fear it depends on mental illness

00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:30.480
and it depends on the ability to manipulate your feelings

00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:32.080
about your own personal safety

00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:32.800
and mothers

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:36.080
especially mothers experiencing postpartum anxiety and postpartum OCD

00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:38.980
like I was are especially

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.800
especially susceptible to this

00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:44.400
because you're watching this crunchy motherhood community rally around RFK

00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:47.960
like he is the answer to all of the corruption within our food system

00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:50.680
and I'm very well versed in our food system

00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:53.320
I'm a trained chef and I have hyper fixated on like

00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:55.880
Michael Poland's books and the industrialized food system

00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:58.180
so I know there are negatives that need to be addressed

00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:03.680
he is also talking negatively about people who are on ADHD medications or um

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:06.660
antidepressants and and mood disorder medication

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.520
don't think that this is also not gonna spill over to birth control

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:12.000
because the crunchy motherhood community

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.080
also speaks really negatively about birth control

00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:17.160
and yes there are side effects to birth control

00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:18.680
there is nothing you participate in

00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:20.560
there is not one choice that you make

00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:22.960
where you are not weighing the pros and cons

00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:29.240
the pros of birth control for women as a whole outweigh the cons at the moment

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:32.160
does that mean we should be putting more research into it

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:33.000
putting more money into it

00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:34.380
making it a safer product

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.680
researching women's health at a more um

00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:39.800
aggressive level yes

00:03:39.801 --> 00:03:43.860
but taking away a safety net for women because you think it's too toxic

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.400
is not the answer

00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:48.820
you cannot take away a safety net without something else in place

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.680
I feel the same way about our food system

00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:52.240
we have an industrialized food system

00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:55.360
that is made to feed a large majority of people

00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:57.760
if you have money and you have access

00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:59.160
you can get better ingredients

00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:00.560
you can grow your own food

00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:02.340
you can support local farms

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.880
people who do not have the ability time

00:04:04.881 --> 00:04:11.540
money or access to local small farms require the industrialized food system

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.580
kids who are getting free school lunches

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.160
communities that are food deserts uh

00:04:16.161 --> 00:04:18.440
they require cheap food so

00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:20.240
if we are not going to first

00:04:20.241 --> 00:04:24.600
make sure that all of our communities have access to healthily grown

00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:27.620
sustainably grown and cheap

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.080
inexpensive Whole Foods you can't take away or highly regulated system

00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:35.280
that is currently keeping people from starving

00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:36.840
because guess what

00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:41.160
people would rather be fed low quality food than not be fed at all

00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:43.760
I feel exactly the same about vaccines

00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:46.800
there are people who want to have the option to put their kids in public school

00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:48.480
without vaccinations there's people who are saying oh

00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:49.880
it's my personal responsibility

00:04:49.881 --> 00:04:52.320
it is not there are negatives to taking vaccines

00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:54.160
there are positive to taking vaccines

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:56.940
the positives as a community system

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.400
far outweigh the potential

00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:02.780
negligible percentage of people who have an adverse reaction

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.520
making you scared of something that is in your best benefit to do and use

00:05:07.521 --> 00:05:11.300
and depend on is manipulation

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.040
things like antibiotics things like bleach and household cleaners

00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:21.060
things like fast food even solved a problem that existed

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.980
can these things be better

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.600
yes but be very careful that you are not being manipulated by your fear

00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:33.200
and your anxieties and your mental illness into a place where you are now

00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:34.960
going to distrust everything

00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:38.600
every modern convenience and modern invention that has been created

00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:44.120
that has solved the the death or the suffering of millions of people over time

00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:46.700
because that's not in your best interest

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.158
and they're depending on it
