00:00.480 --> 00:01.780
Okay,

00:03.000 --> 00:04.680
here I go. Been getting some,

00:04.681 --> 00:06.881
like, around the eye dryness.

00:06.882 --> 00:09.741
I don't really know what's going on with allergies.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.260
Let me see. Take your hand away.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.340
I don't know what's going on here,

00:13.640 --> 00:15.200
but I was looking it up,

00:15.201 --> 00:20.541
and they said one of the best remedies for this type of

00:20.840 --> 00:22.900
hydritis is plain yogurt.

00:23.680 --> 00:27.200
Haha. And I said to myself,

00:27.201 --> 00:27.561
well, jeez,

00:27.562 --> 00:29.181
I've got a batch, like,

00:29.400 --> 00:31.460
fresh off the oven, like,

00:31.880 --> 00:33.620
so here we go.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.460
This is.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.780
This is my Greek yogurt batch that I've been Greek

00:43.800 --> 00:49.000
I. You can see I've actually had quite a bit of runoff.

00:49.001 --> 00:54.561
So that's the difference between normal yogurt and Greek yogurt

00:54.562 --> 00:57.321
is you're just training off some of the way.

00:57.322 --> 00:58.581
So there it is.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.540
And I said, she'll use that some over baking.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.320
Um. So here I go.

01:05.321 --> 01:07.401
I mean, I don't really. Yeah,

01:07.402 --> 01:09.621
this is my first time putting yogurt on my face,

01:10.720 --> 01:11.700
but

01:13.800 --> 01:15.180
it was pretty good.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.020
Yeah, just put it all around the eye.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.900
Oh, yeah, I think this was a good idea.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.040
It was in the refrigerator,

01:31.041 --> 01:32.821
so it's like, super.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.760
It's kind of hot outside today,

01:35.761 --> 01:37.301
so this feels pretty good.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.060
I

01:40.520 --> 01:41.740
feel better already.
