00:00.040 --> 00:03.240
I'm just a girl getting ready to go on live TV.

00:03.241 --> 00:06.741
And I know I said that I would chop my hair off for fashion.

00:06.760 --> 00:08.800
I slightly regretted that decision

00:08.801 --> 00:11.881
when I saw just how short my bangs were this morning.

00:11.882 --> 00:14.681
So if you see me wearing a hat more than usual,

00:14.682 --> 00:15.801
that's why.

00:15.802 --> 00:19.281
Got picked up at 6:00am this morning and we drove into the city.

00:19.282 --> 00:22.941
I can't believe that I'm gonna be on the today show in a few hours.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.840
Had a quick fitting for the outfits that I was gonna wear,

00:25.841 --> 00:27.441
and then I got my hair sorted,

00:27.442 --> 00:32.061
did my makeup before I got changed and did the last final touches.

00:32.120 --> 00:35.840
I slept so bad the night before because I was so nervous for this,

00:35.841 --> 00:38.241
but before I knew it, I was going backstage,

00:38.242 --> 00:41.501
getting mic'd up, going through all of my demo steps.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.720
Couple minutes before we were live,

00:43.721 --> 00:46.801
I went into the studio and then it was time to film.

00:46.802 --> 00:49.041
The kids and lucky were watching from home

00:49.042 --> 00:51.841
and he got so emotional when he saw me get on.

00:51.842 --> 00:53.761
It went so much quicker than I thought,

00:53.762 --> 00:56.121
and I can't believe that this is real life.

00:56.122 --> 00:57.721
And after a quick outfit change,

00:57.722 --> 01:01.261
it was time to go home and talk to my kids all about it.
