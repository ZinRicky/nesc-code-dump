00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.200
do you wanna help with Hurricane relief efforts

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:05.380
and also have a chance to go see the Taylor Swift Aeros tour

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.080
I'm working with my friend Chloe

00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:08.360
who I'm gonna tag down below

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:10.360
who was graciously anonymously

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:15.820
gifted these two Aeros tour tickets for the New Orleans show on October 26th

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.760
the donor wants to remain anonymous

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:19.600
but is a 25 year resident of Texas

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.160
who has been personally impacted by hurricanes

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:24.620
and wanted to do something to help with relief efforts

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.680
so we're raffling off these two tickets

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:28.520
I will have the link in my bio

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:33.500
the winner will be drawn on October 20th at twelve PM Central Standard Time

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.760
over on Chloe's page again

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:37.140
she'll be tagged down below

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.000
and every single raffle entry gets you closer to possibly winning these

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:45.140
errors tour tickets these are approximately the view from your seats

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.480
I know a lot of us have been feeling really helpless

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.280
with how to help these communities

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:52.600
and this is just one way that we can kind of band together

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:54.760
and use the goodness of someone else's hearts

00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:57.540
to help these communities out in their time of need

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.560
so I'm gonna have the link to the raffle in my linktree

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.240
in my link in my bio I'm gonna send you over to Chloe's page

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:04.360
she also is gonna have that

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:05.800
enter as many times as you want

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:07.720
every single entry is uh

00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:12.000
as donation to a relief effort and an entry into the Aeros Tour raffle

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.880
the raffle is gonna be pulled on a live stream on Chloe's page

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:17.700

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.320

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.960
