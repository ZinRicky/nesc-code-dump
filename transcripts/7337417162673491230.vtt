00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.080
I want better for us.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.960
I don't want hating your body

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.360
to be one of the most universal experiences for women.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.520
This woman has lived a full life,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.440
and yet one of her biggest fears is looking at her body,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.160
seeing the number on the scale.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.400
This is why I continuously talk about

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.680
unlearning your fatphobia.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.140
Because you don't wanna wake up when you're 70

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.560
and hate your body.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.200
Still hating your body.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.360
Nobody deserves that.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.640
This woman deserves to love herself and her body.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.880
She got to grow old.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.020
Do you understand what a privilege it is to grow old

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.680
and yet to get to an old age

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.840
and still feel like you're a stranger in your body,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.360
still feeling uncomfortable when you look at yourself?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.660
So many people will never

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.220
understand the peace that comes

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.040
with just being content in your own skin.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.160
And that is literally all I ever want for any of us.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.160
Because one day

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.920
you will wake up

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.140
and your life will have passed you by,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.520
and you will still wake up unhappy with yourself

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.640
and unhappy with your body.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.760
We are consistently being marketed to,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.520
being told that we need to hate ourselves,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.320
hate our bodies,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.000
hate our size,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.720
become small.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.180
And unless you take active action,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.160
unless you take a moment to look at your body

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.920
and just become comfortable to accept it,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.880
unless you do that,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.080
you will always be at odds with yourself.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.520
You will always be fighting yourself.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.840
Life Is difficult enough.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.720
You at least deserve to feel peace

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.657
when you look at the mirror
