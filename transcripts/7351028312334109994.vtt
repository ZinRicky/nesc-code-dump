00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.260
this one simple thing will save your partner so much heartache

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.680
and make them respect and love you more

00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:10.481
If your partner comes to you and says “X” is bothering them,

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:11.561
whatever it may be

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:13.521
maybe you're not texting them,

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:14.921
you're not communicating with them,

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:17.401
you're not doing something and it upset them

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:19.121
and they're trying to communicate that to you

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:23.741
what you should do is never disagree or get mad or gaslight them

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.300
instead what you should do is simply say..

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.780
“I understand why you feel that way and I'm sorry”

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.120
it's really that simple

00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:32.041
you should never,

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:35.121
ever argue with someone who tells you that you hurt their feelings.

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:37.401
when you argue with your partner

00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:42.161
the only thing you'll get out of that is distance and strain in the relationship

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.481
you need to come at it at an understanding

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:45.741
respectful way

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.960
and this will mean so much more to them

00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:50.441
People are so used to being gaslit these days

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:53.681
and made to feel like they're asking for too much

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:57.601
it's not too much for your partner to tell you what problems that they have

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:00.561
there will always be someone who is willing to go

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:02.081
above and beyond for your partner

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:03.761
you don't have to win every argument

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:06.601
or even be in an argument with your partner

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:09.474
Instead you should just come to understand your partner and their needs
