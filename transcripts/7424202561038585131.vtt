00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.560
one thing we don't talk enough about

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.960
in the discussions of motherhood and stay at home mom

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:06.360
motherhood is the economics of happiness

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:09.240
now I know we always have to say that money doesn't buy you happiness

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:11.440
but what can buy you is an easier life

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:13.000
and when it comes to being a stay at home mom

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.080
that is such an crucial conversation

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.820
because I have been a stay at home mom for 10 years

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.760
we are not in the same financial situation as we were when I started

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.680
and that has made a humongous difference

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.960
now we were never really struggling financially

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:27.160
but we were definitely not in the same place that we are now

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.320
so when I talk about being happy being a stay home mom

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:31.280
about job satisfaction in the role

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.280
right um

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.920
these are things that you need to take into consideration

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:37.700
especially when you're consuming motherhood content online

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.240
comparing your life to theirs

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.080
because I would say there's three things that greatly

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:46.000
greatly affect your happiness as a stay at home parent

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.620
1 your partner

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.440
how involved in participatory your partner is will make or break your experience

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:53.080
number two I would say is finances

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:56.320
your ability to outsource any of the duties that are under your umbrella

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:59.560
will greatly change your perspective on being a stay home mom

00:00:59.561 --> 00:00:59.960
you know

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:03.280
anyone can be hashtag blessed when they can take a date night when they need it

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:05.840
or hire a cleaner to help out and third

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:07.440
and somewhat related I would say

00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:08.840
is your mental and physical health

00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:11.280
cause even if you were married to the most amazing partner in the world

00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:13.560
and you have the funds to be able to outsource

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:15.660
any sort of domestic labour you want

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.920
if you are struggling mentally

00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:18.840
you will be living in a prison of your own mind

00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:23.760
and that is a complete crap shoot and affects people of both high and low income

00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:24.320
however

00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:28.740
those with expendable income will have better access to mental health services

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.720
and people to watch your children for you to get a break

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:34.160
so still still a factor everyone experiencing motherhood

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.520
is experiencing motherhood in a completely different way

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:38.360
and these factors factor in

00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:40.960
to how well they're gonna be coping with the stresses

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:43.060
both physical and mental of the role

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.840
so in order to be an informed consumer of social media

00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:47.200
especially surrounding something dude

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:50.780
so deeply personal and intimate as a motherhood journey

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.080
please keep in mind those three factors

00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:55.560
because they make or break someone's experience

00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:58.320
no I don't mean that everybody with expendable income

00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.540
is going to have a easy time in motherhood

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.680
and I'm not saying that everybody who is doing every single domestic job

00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:08.480
and has no breaks isn't going to be possible to be having a great time either

00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:10.400
I'm just saying when you're watching creators

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.220
and you're comparing yourselves to things you see online

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.920
to keep in mind that the economics of happiness plays a role

00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:21.620
the village is important if you don't have it by birth or by community

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.640
having the funds to pay for it will make things easier

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:27.710
because the village has always been necessary in child rearing
