00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.960
listen I am getting older

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:02.961
I'm getting wiser 

00:00:02.962 --> 00:00:05.520
I wanna be in with the news and with the times

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.440
so I watched the presidential debate

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.840
that was hands down the cringiest thing

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.280
I was at a loss for words

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:13.440
and their reactions and responses

00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:15.320
who are we supposed to vote for

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:16.243
genuinely 

00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:19.140
I guess it was entertaining so I gotta give Trump for that

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.480
he definitely brings in the views

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:22.800
But could anyone actually watch that fully?

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.120
what are we supposed to do

00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:25.560
what are the Americans supposed to do

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:26.426
Who do we vote for?

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:28.160
Did y'all get anything out of that debate

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.228
Anyways see you later alley cats
