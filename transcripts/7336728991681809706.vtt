00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.680
You know that saying that all women say that goes like,

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:04.488
“if he wanted to, he would”

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:06.161
if he’s not willing to do nice things for you,

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:07.121
another man will!

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.721
my nephew asked me

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:10.501
does this supply for men too?

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.760
like absolutely!

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.481
find a woman up to your standards.

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:16.001
he was like if she won't do laundry or cook for me

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.141
find someone who will? yeah sure

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.120
she doesn't go to the gym with me and work out

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:21.201
find someone who will?

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:22.961
yeah find someone who will..

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:24.161
and I'm looking at him like

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.481
it sounds so terrible coming from a man right?

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:28.201
but us woman do this all the time

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:28.761
it made me think

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:32.081
I'm not sure if this rule necessarily applies for everyone/everything 

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:32.938
but maybe it does?
