00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.600
Okay, why did no one tell me?

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:05.521
Yesterday I showed you my crossbody bag,

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.521
and I told you there's something that I loved about

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:09.121
that no other crossbody bag has.

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:10.621
And then my video cut out.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.680
Don't know what happened, but I didn't get to show you my favorite part.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:18.081
Okay, I know that it doesn't look like it on here,

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:19.961
but I am a very small human.

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:22.641
I am 5 foot tall, less than 100 pounds,

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:25.621
and I'm an easy target when I'm not about my kids.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.560
Except when I'm wearing this crossbody bag.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:30.081
The reason why I love it. I showed you all the compartments yesterday,

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:34.461
how much space it has. But my absolute favorite thing about this bag

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.420
is this pocket right here,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.000
because it is big enough to conceal whatever it is you need to conceal

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.261
to protect you and yourself when you're out with your kids.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.760
Whatever that looks like for you.

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:47.221
I know that is for our family.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.840
But it is so perfect. It fits everything I need when I'm out and about,

00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:54.261
and it has an easy access spot.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.560
So if you are also a mom who likes to,

00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:59.841
you know, be conscious about her whereabouts

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:01.701
and what she does when she's out and about her kids,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.940
you need this crossbody bag.
