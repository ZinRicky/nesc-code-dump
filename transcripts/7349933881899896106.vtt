00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.160
why is everyone so convinced that drinking alcohol equates so good time?

00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:07.561
in fact it's honestly the biggest waste of time for you

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:09.861
don't you wanna live your life being productive?

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.560
being present for your friends and family,

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:15.481
spending time doing the things that you actually enjoy,

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.881
not wasting it on alcohol?

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.121
Not only that it's not healthy for you

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:21.201
alcohol is literally poison

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:23.921
your body knows that and that's why people get sick

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:25.561
hangovers are just not worth it

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:27.941
it may be fun for a short time

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.720
but it's not worth it

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:33.601
your body will thrive when it's not metabolising alcohol

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:37.723
yeah some people can use excuse, “oh it's to relieve some stress” 

00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:38.151
Is it??

00:00:38.152 --> 00:00:40.721
 In fact, I think it's a temporary band aid

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:44.041
Having one drink isn't gonna make all your problems go away

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:46.561
there's so many better ways to relieve your stress

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:48.761
go on a walk, go outdoors,

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:50.521
meditate, pet your dogs,

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:52.230
hang out with your family, self care

00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:54.841
 there's just so much more you can do to relieve stress

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:57.841
and I promise you you won't find it at the end of a bottle

00:00:57.842 --> 00:00:59.001
Today's society

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.601
has been absolutely brainwashed to think that alcohol is good for you,

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:05.261
When it makes everyone a lesser version of themselves.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.640
Yeah you can make fun of the person who doesn't drink,

00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:08.961
call them a party pooper

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:11.801
but really, who's actually thriving in life?

00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:13.150
Probably not the person drinking
