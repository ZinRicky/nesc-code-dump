00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.120
There's so many lesbian heroes that we don't talk about enough,

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:04.881
and this woman is one of them.

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:06.361
Meet Lorraine Hansbury,

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:09.701
a playwright and activist best known for her play A reason in the sun.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.400
Lorraine was born in Chicago in 1930

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.121
and was the granddaughter of a freed

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:17.041
enslaved person. When she was 8 years old,

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:18.721
her family moved to a white neighborhood

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:20.241
where they faced violent attacks

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:22.761
and a court ruling that ordered them to move away

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:25.921
because they were black. Lorraine's family didn't back down.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:29.001
Instead, they took the case to the Supreme Court and won.

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.641
Lorraine was heavily involved in activism throughout her life

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:33.761
and started her writing career at a progressive

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:35.621
black newspaper called freedom.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.800
Later, she joined the daughters of Belitis,

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:38.961
the first lesbian,

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:42.041
civil and political rights organization in the United States,

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.301
and wrote about feminism and homophobia in their magazine.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.320
She went on to write A Raisin in the sun,

00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:50.141
a play about a struggling black family in Chicago.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.840
It became the first play on Broadway

00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:54.221
to be produced by an African American woman.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.040
Sadly,

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:58.521
the rain passed away from pancreatic cancer at the young age of 34,

00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:00.961
but her legacy lives on to this day.

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:01.801
A Raisin in the sun

00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:04.481
is considered one of the best place in American history

00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:07.541
and has made its way from Broadway to television and film.
