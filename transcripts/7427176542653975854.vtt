00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
I might be in the minority here,

00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:06.741
but there is one type of holiday decor that I hate more than anything,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.340
and that is lawn inflatables.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.680
I cringe when I see them. I do not like them.

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:16.561
I do not want them. My husband just informed me that he did,

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:20.841
in fact, buy the kids a Halloween salon inflatable,

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:24.341
and he is so excited to surprise them when he gets home.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.880
I'm cringing. He's like,

00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:28.441
I can put it in the backyard so nobody else will see it.

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:29.361
I'm like, no,

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.761
that means I have to look at it

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:33.141
put in the front yard where I can't see it.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.700
Oh, man,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.652
this is what marriage is like.
