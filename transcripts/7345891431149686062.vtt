00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.320
TikTok has become a place where so many women

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.240
and single mothers are able to come together,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.560
talk about how fucked up the family court is,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.580
talk about their personal experiences,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.720
spread the fucking truth

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.400
about what it was like to really be a trad wife.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.960
You're not gonna erase us.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.080
We're the millennials.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.200
We're not gonna just fucking go away.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.160
We're the fucking MySpace generation.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.040
You think some social media is gonna come out,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.780
and I don't think it's for me,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.440
bitch, I'm one of the ones that started social media.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.080
We were the ones that were adding music to our pages

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.560
and learning HTML and shit to fuck with it.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.120
We're the generation that is running

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.360
the tech industry right now.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.280
We're the generation.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.400
That's why there's no more plumbers and electricians,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.220
because we're the motherfuckers online.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.000
If a fucking social media platform comes out, of course

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.960
I feel like I have a place there to have my voice heard.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.440
And so among all the other reasons that it feels like

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560
they're trying to take TikTok away from us,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.040
I definitely feel like it is just one more assault

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.840
against women.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.080
It's one small

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.840
little tunnel that we have found

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.440
to communicate with each other,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.600
find each other,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.400
try to yell to the other women

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.860
to see if they can hear us.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.240
You know, create these pathways to escape

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.880
and create these pathways to income.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.800
Because this is not an MLM,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.560
the TikTok shop.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.680
This is truly just Cutting out the middle man.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.540
Jeff Bezos no longer gets a cut.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.280
The moms get to work directly with the manufacturers

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.920
in Fucking China.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.900
And they're like, hey,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.160
can you sell my lamp?

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.080
And I'll give you,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.720
you know, 10 cents for everyone you sell.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.720
And we're like, got you.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.200
And we tell all our friends about it,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.320
and some friends wanna buy it,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.560
some strangers wanna buy it.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.160
And that's how so many moms are making it.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.600
So many people,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.160
young dudes.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.480
I see fucking young dudes that are out here.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.400
How you think they're ballers?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.520
They're making money on TikTok?

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.500
Like, it's complete bullshit that the band got passed

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.000
and that it's. It's.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.360
It's working its way through.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.720
So I think we all need to be, like,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.960
as loud as possible

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.460
in every way possible right now.
