00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.180
An average Thursday morning in my life as a 22 year old Chad wife.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.160
I get up around 6:30 or 7,

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:08.961
and I first start by packing my husband's lunch

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:10.781
because he leaves her work around 7.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.840
He's been up since, like, 5,

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:14.581
and he makes himself breakfast.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.400
So I just, like,

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:17.641
get up, pack his lunch,

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.301
we cuddle a little bit.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.400
So we don't see each other a lot these days.

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:22.681
When he can get the work,

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:25.281
he works for long hours,

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:28.061
so it's always nice when we see each other.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.960
And then the next thing that I do is I go and sit down on the couch,

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:33.761
read my Bible,

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:34.801
do my devotions.

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:37.441
I'm enjoying morning and evening by Spurgeon right now.

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:39.001
And then I start getting ready for the day.

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.441
I do dry shampoo on my bangs,

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:43.561
water the cat, um,

00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:45.781
and then I'm gonna put on a dress.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I love wearing dresses during the day.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:49.521
I just feel so put together.

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:51.001
And then I fix my hair.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:51.841
I've been loving this,

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:53.221
like, 90s style.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.880
And then I'm gonna make my breakfast,

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:57.001
which is a protein shake pretty much every day.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:00.761
But today I have some bagels that I made the day before.

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:02.561
So I'm having a bagel and cream cheese.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.981
These are blueberry bagels.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.200
Then I sit down

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:09.121
and I review my to do list and add a couple things to it.

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:11.861
And then I'm going to ship off some packages

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.020
for my customers over at My cottage shop.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.480
And then today, I'm starting on my first project,

00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:19.981
which is reorganizing my office.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.580
Thanks for watching
