00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.760
Today I'm gonna go over why I absolutely love my chamber stove

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:04.281
while I clean her. Now,

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:05.761
she doesn't need duct tape right here,

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:08.961
but my son loves to open the pantry compartment right here,

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:11.321
so I have tape on there to stop him from opening it.

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:13.801
I had a over spill of chocolate sauce from the top,

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:15.721
so it fell through into the pantry area

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:18.701
where I keep my Dutch oven bread oven,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.080
which if you don't have one of those,

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:22.881
they're really cool. Here is the grill broiler area,

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:24.581
which I get a lot of questions about.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.600
The grill on top, the griddle on top is removable,

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.401
and so is the grease catcher on the bottom.

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:32.041
So unless you don't clean,

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:34.081
you don't really have a risk of fire.

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:36.241
This is the bevel that covers up the pilot light.

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:37.361
I did turn the gas off,

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:40.481
so that's the pilot light that lights the flash tubes here

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:42.141
that lights the daisy burners.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.600
So when I turn the gas on,

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:46.801
gas travels through the flash tubes and up into the pilot light

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:49.241
and causes a little mini explosion

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:51.081
that goes through the daisy burner and lights them.

00:00:51.082 --> 00:00:53.321
It's pretty cool and I like doing it every time.

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:54.961
It never gets old. Here

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:56.161
you can see some of the chocolate sauce

00:00:56.162 --> 00:00:57.921
that spilled down underneath the drip pans.

00:00:57.922 --> 00:01:00.161
I had a massive overflow of chocolate sauce

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:02.161
when I walked away from the stove for a second.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:05.261
So once that happened, I It was time for a deep clean.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.500
She is so beautiful.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.720
And here you can see some more of that chocolate sauce.

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:11.401
It was really bad and burnt,

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:14.041
but all the drip trays and all the pieces come off,

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:15.281
and I put them in soapy water,

00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:17.381
and it all came clean pretty easily.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.000
I think my most common question I get is,

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.361
what is that stove? It's a Chambers Model C.

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:24.981
It was made here in the USA.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.660
It was a company, a family company that made stoves.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.380
I think their last name was chambers.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.760
From the early 1900s all way up until,

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:37.121
I think the 1970s. They have a 70s model,

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:40.161
which is pretty ugly, but that's when they stopped making them.

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:44.881
This is a Model C. It was made during the 1950s into the early 1960s,

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:46.761
I do believe. This is the pantry area.

00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:47.901
It's not an oven,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.920
but it's somewhere where you're supposed to store your dry goods,

00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:53.221
which I just keep my bread oven in there.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.520
The other question I get is,

00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:55.961
how do you clean the grill area?

00:01:55.962 --> 00:01:57.661
Well, all this comes apart.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.760
There's a drip tray that normally goes in here where I keep the, um.

00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:02.241
Where I put cooked bacon on.

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:03.441
These are the daisy burners.

00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:06.361
They pop in and out. I don't take them out unless I'm cleaning them.

00:02:06.362 --> 00:02:07.841
I did paint these, um,

00:02:07.842 --> 00:02:10.761
when I put them back, they need to be re enabled,

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:12.521
which is just not something I'm gonna Do right now,

00:02:12.522 --> 00:02:15.781
but they are super old. That's why they are like that.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.280
I love the stove,

00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:20.501
and I'm never going back to having a regular stove ever again.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.840
This thing is moving with me wherever we go.

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:25.401
That's a bold statement, but I will try to stick to it.

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:27.661
I would literally feel bad if I left her behind.
