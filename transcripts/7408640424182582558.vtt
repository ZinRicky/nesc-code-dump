00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.840
A lot of times we stay because of finances, appearances, kids.

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:10.421
We lie to ourselves to pretend like everything's okay.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.920
When I realized I had to get a divorce,

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:15.881
I had a neighbor that the two of us were having kids at about, like.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.801
We had some kids that kind of lined up in age.

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:19.441
We had pregnancies similar.

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:22.561
We would share. It was like the cutest shit that you would want.

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:24.361
And our husbands were kind of similar.

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:25.761
And I didn't really like her husband,

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:28.621
but I had every excuse in the world for my husband.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.840
I was different. Our relationship was different.

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.021
Our. She didn't understand our shit.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.080
But I had, like,

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:36.201
such a fucking judgmental eye for her husband.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.321
And there was a little time that we weren't able to go for walks,

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.121
like it was winter or whatever.

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:42.481
And then she said to me, hey,

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:44.201
you know, can we start doing those morning walks again?

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:45.361
Cause I really need a friend.

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:46.161
I need to talk to somebody.

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:46.681
And I was like, yeah,

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:49.001
for sure. And all we could do was, like,

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:50.241
walk two blocks and come back.

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:52.021
We both had to get back to our kids.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.120
And she would tell me these stories

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.801
of arguments that she was having with her husband.

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:57.241
And I would be like, wow.

00:00:57.242 --> 00:00:59.081
And I would be giving her all this advice, like, girl,

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:00.601
you deserve better. That's not okay.

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:01.841
But when she would tell me the stories,

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:03.201
they were really Like

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:06.181
ringing a bell with shit that was going on in my marriage.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.900
And eventually I had to face myself and be like, wow,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.840
I'm gonna give somebody else this advice.

00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:15.521
Like, I can see how wrong it is in somebody else's marriage,

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:18.561
but I'm making every fucking excuse in the book for my marriage.

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:21.041
And thank god I had a friend coming to me,

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:23.201
and I was able to have that internal insight

00:01:23.202 --> 00:01:26.541
to realize I'm lying to my goddamn self.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.280
I'm the reason I'm being treated this way,

00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.821
because I'm fucking staying.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.440
I can leave and I can figure some shit out.

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.181
There's no reason I have to stay.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.380
And that's when I fucking woke up and left.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.520
I realized, because you could tell yourself whatever little fancy story,

00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:41.521
but at the end of the day,

00:01:41.522 --> 00:01:42.861
I thought, what if he died?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.440
What if you were dead and literally not here?

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:48.521
What would I do then? And from that point on,

00:01:48.522 --> 00:01:51.941
I started making moves, and I changed my own life.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.880
No one's gonna come and save you.

00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:55.001
All those little princess stories.

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.241
I think that's the worst fucking thing we can tell our daughters.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:00.761
Or let our little girls. The lies we let our little girls believe,

00:02:00.762 --> 00:02:02.841
is that somebody's gonna come and save you.

00:02:02.842 --> 00:02:04.161
This is your fucking life.

00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:05.641
You came in this world alone,

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:07.741
and you're gonna fucking die alone.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.480
And it's okay to have relationships and connections while we're here,

00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:13.981
but to depend on Another person for every ounce of your everything.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.040
Every ounce of your fucking everything.

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:20.361
Not just your finances, but your fucking worth.

00:02:20.362 --> 00:02:23.141
Your out, every bit of. You know,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.320
it's. A lot of women just don't wanna own up to that and realize that.

00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:30.081
So if you're happy, you're happy.

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:32.689
But some. Some women know
