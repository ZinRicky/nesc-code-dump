00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.680
do people understand

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:05.240
the likelihood of a national abortion ban in the next few years

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:08.320
like even if Republicans don't control Congress

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.120
there's a few different ways that this could play out

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:13.400
let me explain first thing they're gonna try to use is the Comstock Act

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:15.960
The Comstock Act is a law from the 1800s

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.480
that prohibited you from mailing obscene matter

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:23.580
including contraception and any tools that could be used to procure an abortion

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.040
The Comstock act was the product of this weirdo narc named Anthony Comstock

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:30.840
who was obsessed with trying to eradicate corn

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.480
birth control and abortion throughout the United States

00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:34.880
we've really come full circle here

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:37.460
cause that's also kind of the modern day Republican Party

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.840
see the Comstock Act just kind of like floated into oblivion where it belongs

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.280
it was never actually repealed

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:45.580
so it's a law that's still on the books in the United States

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.560
Republicans are currently trying to revive the Comstock Act

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.640
particularly in the mifepristone litigation

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:54.680
where they are arguing that abortion pills can't be sent through the mail

00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:57.100
because it's prohibited under the Comstock Act

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.080
this is just the starting point for conservatives

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:03.040
who are trying to find a court that will hold that this 150 year old law

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:05.640
can be used to prohibit abortion pills today

00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:07.360
and that the law is constitutional

00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:11.160
given uphill battle because the law is pretty clearly unconstitutionally vague

00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:15.700
it bans sending any obscene matter through the US Postal Service

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.060
which doesn't really give citizens any idea

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.600
of what is and is not prohibited under the act

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:24.600
but I've seen some really wild opinions by Trump appointed judges

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:27.280
so you can really never be sure at this point

00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:29.880
If they succeed at finding a court that will rely on the Comstock Act

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.040
they're gonna go in after birth control under the act

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:34.720
and then they're going to try to eradicate abortion nationwide

00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:36.640
by relying on the act's provision

00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:39.800
that it prohibits any tools that are being sent through the mail

00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:41.040
to procure an abortion

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:43.900
so they'll just try to start banning a bunch of medical tools

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.960
remember this is a law that's already on the book

00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:46.920
so if Trump wins

00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:50.240
he wouldn't necessarily need Congress to help him affectuate this plan

00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:52.360
second thing they're gonna try to do is argue that the FDA

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.720
and other federal agencies screwed up when they approved medication

00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:57.520
abortion and abortion procedures

00:01:57.521 --> 00:01:59.640
and it's actually just really unsafe for women

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:01.480
and we're just really looking out for women to go

00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:02.960
watch my video on the Chevron doctrine

00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:05.600
to fully understand the intricacies of how this one will play out

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.120
but basically earlier this week

00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:12.360
the Supreme Court gave a green light for courts to second guess federal agencies

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:16.000
like the FDA so just as in the mifipristone litigation

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.840
plaintiffs are arguing that look

00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.900
the FDA screwed up when it approved mifipristone

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.040
a commonly used unsafe abortion medication

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:25.600
which is safer than penicillin

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:27.340
tylenol and Viagra

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.040
and they're trying to find anti choice

00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:30.880
extremist judges to be like yeah

00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:35.700
I am wiser than the FDA the expert scientists and doctors at the FDA

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.020
and I will second guess them and take mifepristone off the market

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.160
if they succeed at that they'll try to start doing that

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.500
for methods of birth control and other methods of procuring an abortion

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.400
and the last option

00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:49.440
is that Republicans are just going to try to pass a national abortion ban

00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:53.240
depending on how much control they have of Congress and the presidency

00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:54.520
this whole idea like

00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:55.840
let's just leave it to the states

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:56.940
yeah um

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.660
they are lying to you they absolutely want a national abortion ban

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.560
so yeah

00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.800
um not to scare everybody

00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:08.920
but this is the practical reality that we need to understand and plan for

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:09.960
and fight against

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:13.960
and I think a lot of people who live in blue states feel pretty safe

00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.740
like they don't feel like an abortion ban is gonna come to them

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.160
but as I just explained there's multiple avenues that it may come to you

00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:24.160
and they're actively trying to affectuate them

00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:25.280
like yesterday

00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:28.980
this is everything I just described is already happening
