00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.720
I have like a violent amount of makeup

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:02.920
like drugstore to like

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:05.840
very fancy and out of all of them

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:07.520
the best one for my skin tone and like

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:09.680
the most beautiful and natural

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:13.200
and all the ones I go to the most is this Colourpop Blush

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.280
stix in cool it

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.240
like I have used almost all

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.420
this is all that's left

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.840
and this is genuinely my favorite blush to this day because it's so like

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:27.560
natural and gives me like the perfect flush for my face and for the longest

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:28.480
like this is for example

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:30.280
another version like

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:31.240
this is great and all

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:34.240
but it's like really pinky so you have to blend it out much more

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:35.900
and I'm very heavy handed right

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.080
so this one is like the perfect like

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:44.120
tone for my skin because I don't have to do much of the blending

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:46.080
and I used to buy like the most pigmented

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:48.240
like Pussy Pop pink blush and then like

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.760
spend like so long trying to blend into my skin where I was like oh

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:53.680
I can just have something like this is like

00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:56.460
more subtle and more appropriate to my skin tone

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.860
and then like

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.360
I don't do all that work blending

00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:01.800
I just tap it out a little bit on the edges and that's it and that's

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:02.920
I'm done anyways

00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:04.480
I know again other people have probably realized this

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:08.080
but as someone who's always gone very heavy handed with makeup

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:10.560
because I don't want it to look like I'm not wearing any of that

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:11.040
makes sense like

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.360
I want people I won't wanna wear makeup approval to know that I'm wearing makeup

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:15.120
but now I'm like

00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:17.600
learning how to do a little bit more subtle makeup

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:18.880
um and I don't know

00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:19.960
I just I love this blush

00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:20.830
and it's my favorite
