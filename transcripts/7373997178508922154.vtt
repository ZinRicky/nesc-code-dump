00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.620
I don't think you understand the mental toll

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.120
of being dogpiled on by the entire internet

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:07.960
I don't think you understand the mental toll of being a fat person

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:08.840
on the internet

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:09.680
with a large audience

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:14.040
I don't think you guys understand what it's like to have hundreds

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:18.000
if not thousands of millions of people hating you

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.160
like I don't think you guys cannot comprehend what that is like

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:24.940
right so you can have your opinions on whoever have your opinions of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.980
but I need you all to like

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.020
understand that the human mind is not meant

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.720
to withstand the amount of hatred that can be pushed onto one single

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:39.560
individual person now on the internet

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:40.240
like I

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:47.160
the human mind is genuinely not meant to consume that much hatred about oneself

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:48.040
it just really isn't

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:51.880
so my rule of thumb normally is when a situation is happening

00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:55.120
before I contribute to dog piling onto a person and saying things

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.260
I've already been said

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.800
uh I think about first of all

00:00:57.801 --> 00:01:02.120
is that person in a place to be able to understand what I'm saying to them

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:05.200
to be able to take what I'm saying constructively

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:07.280
or is this gonna cause more harm than good

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:08.980
also like what are

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.120
what is the context of what is going on

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:13.120
like what is the mental state of this person

00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:14.240
like why

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.000
what's going on

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:15.860
like I just

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.880
oh like

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:19.240
I uh I have been attacked by Ed

00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:20.200
Twitter by Taylor Swift

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:21.600
stans by you know

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:24.240
anti fat liberation people on YouTube

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:25.320
libs of TikTok stans

00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:29.360
like I have experienced dog piling in a way that many people have not um

00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:32.720
and I truly would not wish that experience on my worst enemy

00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:34.980
I don't think like I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.320
there are very few people who I think deserve to be treated in that way

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:40.680
I think there are very few actions um

00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:42.560
that deserve that type of treatment

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:44.800
and um I don't know

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:47.720
I guess maybe I have too much Grace um

00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:51.680
as someone who has first hand experienced the toll that it can take on someone

00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:54.020
um all I'm gonna say is maybe

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.280
just I don't know

00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:57.380
be considerate of that
