00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
I really don't think that there's anything that society loves more

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:08.421
than putting a girl or a woman way up on the highest tippity pedestal,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.140
only to, like,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.680
gather around and watch and cheer as we tear her right off of it.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.480
we're not out here requiring male celebrities to endorse candidates

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:21.841
and endorse the candidate that we want them to

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:24.201
and articulate why they're endorsing that candidate

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:25.601
in a way that pleases us.

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:29.241
They're allowed to just do the bare minimum and focus on their art.

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:32.001
And a good amount of times they can't even do that.

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.601
They'll be like, blatantly horrible.

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:36.281
And in those situations, society will be like,

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:39.341
well, I'm separating the art from the artist.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.880
I am hearing more commentary about what Chapel Ron,

00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:45.801
a 26 year old girl if what she is and isn't doing correctly,

00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:49.841
then I have heard about the actual atrocities that P.

00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:54.241
Diddy inflicted on a ton of people's lives with the help of others,

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:57.301
and he's like a grown ass man who did it deliberately.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.680
And I'm sure that there's commentary that's valid.

00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:02.401
All I'm saying is there's a clear double standard

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:07.321
of how much we expect out of young women and girls

00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:10.201
and how much we love to tear them down

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.781
in a way that we don't do with male celebrities.
