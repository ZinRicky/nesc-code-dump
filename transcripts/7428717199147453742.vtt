00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.300
you know what really makes my ass itch

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.800
as women age especially after having children

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.120
they are expected to bounce back

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:07.640
they are expected to be the most perfect

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:10.220
Polish plucked and Pilate version of themselves

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.840
oh wow

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:13.880
it's totally socially accepted and sometimes even admired

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:15.800
for men to grow into a potato

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:19.040
so while we decided that it was a moral failing of a 38 year old woman

00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:19.960
who popped out three kids

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:22.800
to no longer fit into her jeans from when she was 25

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:25.720
we're being told it's because we just don't prioritize our health

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:27.420
we're letting ourselves go

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.200
when that's exactly what motherhood is

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:32.120
by design it is letting go of your needs as a woman

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:33.960
as an individual as a human being

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:35.800
in service to your husband and children

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:38.740
or at least that's the propaganda that they're trying to get you to believe

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.200
a good wife a good mother

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.880
gives up all self autonomy

00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:44.840
all selfish notions of personal identity and care

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:46.880
for the betterment offer children and family

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:50.820
but then what do they do they complain that she let herself go

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.460
there she goes she didn't let herself go anywhere

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.560
and we blame the woman

00:00:56.561 --> 00:00:59.520
because it's so much easier to put that on personal accountability right

00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:01.060
it's so much easier to say hmm

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.600
she just doesn't care enough

00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:05.880
she just doesn't care enough to be sexy for her husband

00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:07.540
and then when he leaves

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.640
we justify it as a collective society

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:13.080
we will buy into the excuse of oh

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.040
I just wasn't attracted to her anymore

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.000
or she was too tired for sex all the time

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:18.580
she didn't have enough time for me

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.800
you know one of the tells

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:21.320
not the only one but one of the tells

00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:23.660
I can tell that somebody has a good husband

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.200
they look good they feel good

00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:29.918
because they have time because where do you think that time is coming from
