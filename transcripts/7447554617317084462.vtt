00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.640
So I post a lot of, like,

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:03.841
finding your style after motherhood content,

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:06.501
personal style content, fashion content,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.740
um, especially when it pertains to motherhood.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.080
But I wanted to kind of put this out there

00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:15.241
because I've been having a rough time the last couple of days,

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:17.981
and there's something so incredibly necessary

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.040
about wearing clothes that you feel good in.

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:24.361
And what you feel good in in one phase or one chapter

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:27.121
is not gonna be the same thing you feel good in in another chapter.

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:28.041
So, for example,

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:29.681
I have been feeling really,

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:32.181
really overstimulated. I have ADHD.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.120
I also homeschool my kids.

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:36.161
I'm just. I'm tapped out, okay?

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:37.681
And I do love doing my makeup,

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:38.721
and I do love getting dressed,

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:40.441
and sometimes that can pull me out of a funk,

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:42.601
but sometimes it really fucking can't.

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:45.001
And on those days, the softest,

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:45.801
fluffiest,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.640
least tight piece of clothing is going to be what I reach for.

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:52.721
Today it is this. Will I get dressed for the day?

00:00:52.722 --> 00:00:55.201
I don't know yet. But right now I know I feel really,

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:58.481
really comfortable and safe in my cozy,

00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:01.041
fluffy hoodie. In the early years of motherhood,

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:03.761
I didn't want to be perceived, okay?

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:06.001
I was also going through a lot of mental health issues.

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:07.381
I wanted to be comfortable,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.040
and I wanted to be invisible,

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:12.961
and that's how I dressed. I definitely still have these feelings.

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:15.281
There are days when I'm either, like,

00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:17.041
in a weird part of My cycle,

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:18.881
or I'm having a super, like,

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:21.601
aggressively neurodivergent day where I just.

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:23.401
I don't wanna be perceived,

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:25.961
in which case I usually don't even leave my house.

00:01:25.962 --> 00:01:28.441
Because to me, and this is still how I look at it,

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:32.361
I'm either gonna put in 100% of the effort to do hair,

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:33.381
makeup, accessories,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.480
clothes, everything.

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:36.961
Be fucking fit to death, right?

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:39.841
Dress to the nines, or there's no effort.

00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:42.981
I don't do that. I don't do casual super well,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.840
because to me, to me personally, um,

00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:49.361
when I dress casual, I feel like I'm just like,

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:52.801
half assing getting done, if that makes sense.

00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:55.121
Which doesn't give me the same sort of, like, confidence.

00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:58.061
So if you were in your fluffy hoodie,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.540
don't be perceived, be as comfortable as possible phase,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.160
just know that even people like me,

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:05.241
who love getting glammed up and love getting dressed.

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:05.961
Hold on, babe,

00:02:05.962 --> 00:02:08.261
one second. I have days like that too.
