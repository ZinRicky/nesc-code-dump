Ladies,

00:00.681 --> 00:05.141
if you are dating a man and your ultimate dream is to be a homemaker,

00:05.480 --> 00:08.740
and you have expressed this to that man,

00:08.840 --> 00:13.540
and that man says living off of 1 income is 1. Impossible,

00:13.760 --> 00:15.100
2 outdated,

00:15.800 --> 00:19.200
and that it is more realistic to live off a fifty fifty,

00:19.201 --> 00:23.021
meaning you both split the bills and the responsibilities

00:23.280 --> 00:24.360
around the house.

00:24.361 --> 00:27.641
Just know that is that man's way of telling you

00:27.642 --> 00:29.761
he does not want to be a provider.

00:29.762 --> 00:31.821
He does not have what it takes

00:32.080 --> 00:36.140
to do what is needed to provide for you and your family.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.400
And you don't need to ask any more questions.

00:39.401 --> 00:43.001
You shouldn't have to convince a man, um,

00:43.002 --> 00:44.381
to be a provider.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.920
Some men just aren't providers,

00:46.921 --> 00:48.041
and that's okay.

00:48.042 --> 00:50.161
However, if your dream is to be a homemaker,

00:50.162 --> 00:54.101
do not continue wasting your time with this type of man.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.300
There are plenty of men out there that make this lifestyle realistic,

00:58.400 --> 01:00.080
and they do what needs to be done.

01:00.081 --> 01:02.421
They might work more than one job.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.140
They might, um,

01:04.160 --> 01:06.040
put you in a smaller home.

01:06.041 --> 01:08.641
They might change states to, um,

01:08.642 --> 01:11.441
a state that is more realistic to live off of one income.

01:11.442 --> 01:15.001
You might not even be able to be fully on one income.

01:15.002 --> 01:17.481
You might need to supplement that husband's income.

01:17.482 --> 01:19.401
That's okay. That is okay.

01:19.402 --> 01:21.321
There's nothing untraditional about that.

01:21.322 --> 01:25.261
However, a masculine provider man

01:25.400 --> 01:27.000
will always do what he needs to do

01:27.001 --> 01:29.441
to protect and provide for His family.

01:29.442 --> 01:32.601
Do not delude yourselves into thinking that the next step

01:32.602 --> 01:35.301
will bring out a better version of your man.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.900
Getting married will suddenly not make him a provider.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.960
If you think that when you become a mother and he's a father

01:41.961 --> 01:45.201
that he will suddenly want his wife to stay home with his kids,

01:45.202 --> 01:47.281
that might be true for some,

01:47.282 --> 01:49.141
but for a lot that is not.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.600
And I see this as the case is

01:50.601 --> 01:55.221
a lot of women think that their husband will become a better man.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.460
Um,

01:57.520 --> 01:58.840
I hate to break it to you,

01:58.841 --> 02:00.001
but in the dating stage,

02:00.002 --> 02:02.481
if he's not showing that he wants to be a provider,

02:02.482 --> 02:05.721
then you are not gonna have a provider as a husband, most likely.

02:05.722 --> 02:07.001
When you are dating,

02:07.002 --> 02:11.841
really show how much family and your home will mean to you

02:11.842 --> 02:12.861
in the future.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.000
Really make an emphasis of that.

02:15.001 --> 02:19.601
And, um, don't be prioritizing materialistic things such as cars,

02:19.602 --> 02:21.321
a big house, vacations.

02:21.322 --> 02:23.401
If you truly want to be a homemaker,

02:23.402 --> 02:27.201
express this to him and I promise you, a god fearing,

02:27.202 --> 02:31.501
masculine provider man will give you the world.
