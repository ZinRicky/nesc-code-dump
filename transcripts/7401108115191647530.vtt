00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.920
The political discussions on this app are getting really unhinged.

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:04.961
Just normal. We're gearing up for an election.

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:06.481
It always gets kind of crazy,

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:07.641
especially on social media,

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.601
as we get closer to Election Day.

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:11.461
And this particular election,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.880
I think, is probably more important and more hyped

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:19.721
and more controversial than any other that I've been alive for.

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:21.381
And I'm voting for Kamala.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.200
As a person in a red state

00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:24.881
with a daughter

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:27.381
who's gonna be going through puberty in the next four years,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.080
it's. It's an easy choice for me,

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:32.041
and I understand why people aren't.

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:35.441
But I just wanna remind people of this phrase that is kind of

00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:40.641
kept me focused and centered during all this,

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:42.981
and that is, think globally,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.100
act locally. What's going on in the rest of the world is important,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.540
but where we can enact change is right here at home.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.380
Local elections, domestic elections.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.840
I consider it a power that I have to stop the worst happening here,

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:59.249
so eventually we can hopefully stop the worst happening out.
