00:00.000 --> 00:02.360
In case you missed it, we're moving again.

00:02.361 --> 00:06.241
Heading back to Connecticut to go house hunting for the second time.

00:06.242 --> 00:08.681
After looking at a few houses a couple months ago,

00:08.682 --> 00:10.881
we just needed to look at a few more.

00:10.882 --> 00:12.241
After our job in New York,

00:12.242 --> 00:14.921
we decided to just head out there for a couple days.

00:14.922 --> 00:16.401
We woke up bright and early.

00:16.402 --> 00:18.801
I had some tea, took my vitamins,

00:18.802 --> 00:22.121
journaled before it was time to get dressed myself.

00:22.122 --> 00:23.761
It's actually getting quite chilly,

00:23.762 --> 00:25.281
which I'm really excited about.

00:25.282 --> 00:27.241
I opted for something comfortable

00:27.242 --> 00:30.761
while lucky packed up all of our bags so we could get ready to go.

00:30.762 --> 00:32.201
Since we were running late,

00:32.202 --> 00:34.321
lucky packed up the car pretty quickly

00:34.322 --> 00:36.301
before we headed out to Connecticut.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.960
I never knew how much traffic we'd encounter, though.

00:38.961 --> 00:40.561
It actually ended up taking us

00:40.562 --> 00:42.961
two and a half hours to get to Connecticut,

00:42.962 --> 00:45.761
which gave me plenty of time to do my makeup in the car

00:45.762 --> 00:48.561
and respond to all the emails that I've been missing.

00:48.562 --> 00:50.241
The drive was so beautiful.

00:50.242 --> 00:52.401
Seeing all the trees change color

00:52.402 --> 00:54.961
made me excited to live here during the fall.

00:54.962 --> 00:57.481
And lucky and I are so picky with our houses.

00:57.482 --> 00:59.961
We're looking for something that has really good bones

00:59.962 --> 01:01.321
and a lot of potential

01:01.322 --> 01:04.921
that we would eventually fix up and change a few things.

01:04.922 --> 01:07.841
Trying to convince lucky still to get some chickens.

01:07.842 --> 01:11.241
We're already planning everything we're gonna plant in our garden.

01:11.242 --> 01:13.921
We also went back To see one of our favorite houses

01:13.922 --> 01:16.241
that we viewed last time we were in Connecticut,

01:16.242 --> 01:19.001
and we still love it as much as we did the first time.

01:19.002 --> 01:22.181
There's something I enjoy a lot about an indoor pool.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.320
I love that feature about this house.

01:24.321 --> 01:27.081
After two more days of elaborate house hunting,

01:27.082 --> 01:29.241
I think we found the house that we love.

01:29.242 --> 01:32.401
I can't wait for this journey and to show you guys more.

01:32.402 --> 01:34.623
But for now, we're heading back home to Texas.
