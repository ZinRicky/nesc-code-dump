00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.540
we're back again

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.280
uh the first time we read from our diaries our secrets

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:10.481
um it was a it was a so embarrassing

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:11.801
but it was a bit of a hit

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:15.681
it was so we thought we would maybe do a part two and um

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.901
get a little further in oh

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.940
this is about the Dairy Queen ugh

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.320
I absolutely hate Teddy

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:26.161
I said his name

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:30.181
um I'm really happy I found this out cause he is a total loser

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.040
and David was trying to get Teddy to ask me out and he goes

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:37.841
well I would but her parents probably work at Dairy Queen

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:40.421
wow I remember it almost exactly right then

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.860
then Jordan goes

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.120
well look at it this way

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.101
at least you would get free blizzards

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.980
I'm so glad I don't like him anymore

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.720
I so quickly didn't like him anymore

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:52.301
I wish him ill

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.920
I actually feel a little validated because it was worse because there were like

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:00.881
there was collusion

00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:02.241
these diaries are dangerous

00:01:02.242 --> 00:01:04.281
dangerous this is a lot of danger

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:05.321
okay let's hear

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:08.021
I say it's boring to go out with a boy

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.060
you don't do anything

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.620
you're super shy

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.760
and one day you're gonna break up

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:20.319
