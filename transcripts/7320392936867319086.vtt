00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
I have been dying for this car charger.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.720
I got it off the TikTok shop.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.300
It's link right here if you want one.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.280
Now that I think about it,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.920
I feel like this would be perfect for somebody who does

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.760
like, Uber or something,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.980
cause it has a lightning port,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.600
a USB C, and then it's got two open, uh,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.900
ports where you can connect your own charger.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.800
So I feel like this would be great for like, a, um,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.480
an Uber driver,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.880
cause I could put it kind of in the back,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.520
and, you know,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.020
they can offer this to their person.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.300
However, as a mom of four kids,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.640
that my phone always goes dead.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.000
I cannot charge my phone

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.960
and my little external battery at the same time.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.400
And then if my kids have a device,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.280
cause we're going somewhere,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.020
they can have theirs plugged into.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.600
It also even has like,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.200
a little voltage meter,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.840
so it will tell you how much voltages it's using,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.380
so it's not draining your car's battery.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.640
This thing from the TikTok shop

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.220
is literally one of my favorite purchases.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.280
If you want one,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.760
the link is right here.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.600
And I do make a small commission,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.040
and I appreciate it.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.573
Thank you. Bye.
