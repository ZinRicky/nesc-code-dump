00:00.040 --> 00:03.520
Okay. It has only been, like, a week since my first video,

00:03.521 --> 00:06.201
and he is already so much heavier and bigger.

00:06.202 --> 00:08.941
It's crazy. He growing so quick.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.160
Um, that's something that I didn't realize before getting a dog.

00:12.161 --> 00:14.001
Like, I knew a lab was gonna be big. Okay.

00:14.002 --> 00:16.221
And he had huge paws as a puppy,

00:16.760 --> 00:18.560
so I knew he's gonna be big,

00:18.561 --> 00:22.261
but I didn't realize how quick he would grow.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.760
We've had him for, like, two. No,

00:24.761 --> 00:25.281
we've had him for, like,

00:25.282 --> 00:26.321
three weeks now,

00:26.322 --> 00:27.961
and I feel like he's, like,

00:27.962 --> 00:29.181
tripled in size.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.300
He's huge.

00:31.160 --> 00:31.800
So, yeah,

00:31.801 --> 00:34.181
we'll see. We'll see if we can still do the song

00:36.040 --> 00:36.600
in, like,

00:36.601 --> 00:37.981
seven weeks from now.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.880
I don't know if we're gonna be able to.

00:39.881 --> 00:41.021
Can you say hi?

00:41.320 --> 00:42.760
Can you say hi?

00:42.761 --> 00:43.761
Hi, friends.

00:43.762 --> 00:45.601
He's such a well behaved dog.

00:45.602 --> 00:48.741
We've worked really hard to try and train him so that he,

00:48.840 --> 00:52.660
you know, can sit and he can lay down.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.000
He's gonna come.

00:54.001 --> 00:55.281
He doesn't really know his name yet.

00:55.282 --> 00:57.921
That's the thing that I thought he needed to learn first.

00:57.922 --> 00:59.661
But his name is Hank,

00:59.760 --> 01:01.400
and I don't think he really knows it.

01:01.401 --> 01:02.521
He's just the sweetest pup.

01:02.522 --> 01:04.081
He's really good with our kids.

01:04.082 --> 01:06.041
Oh, that's the Hank update.
