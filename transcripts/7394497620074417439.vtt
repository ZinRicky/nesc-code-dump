00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.600
Can you think of any laws that give government

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:05.861
the power to make decisions about the male body?

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.020
Um. I'm happy that answer a more specific question.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.660
Male versus female.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.100
There are, um,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.520
medical procedures that the government.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.760
the government has the power to make a decision about a man's body.

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.921
I thought you were asking about medical procedures

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:30.661
that are unique to men. I can.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.120
I'll repeat the question.

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:36.321
Can you think of any laws that give the government

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:40.141
the power to make decisions about the male body?

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.374
I'm not. I'm not thinking of any right now, Senator.
