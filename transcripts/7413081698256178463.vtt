You guys remember my daughter's cup that got stolen?

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.480
It was never found. This is like literally the next school year,

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.461
but I got her a new cup from Yogi.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.400
I loved it so much. It was

00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:12.001
the exact design that I loved

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.641
was that you can open this part for open mouth drinking,

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:16.321
so she can, like,

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:17.801
you know, practice that skill.

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:19.321
But then it also has the straw

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.161
for moments when she wants to drink from the straw.

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.081
But here's why I like the milky cup so much better.

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:25.261
And I'm kind of glad the damn cup got stolen,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.020
because most cups have this hard handle, but milky

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.260
makes it easy to switch it out with a soft handle.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.620
And they just click into place.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.400
So they also come in, like a bajillion cute little colors and, like,

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.361
swirly colors and different sizes.

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:46.461
Already putting stickers on them.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.940
I love my new Miyoko Cup. Link right here in the TikTok shop.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.940
And they're just a cute little company cause they stepped up,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.880
so. Yeah,

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:57.161
that's what happened. The cup is gone,

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:59.381
but we have a better one anyway.
