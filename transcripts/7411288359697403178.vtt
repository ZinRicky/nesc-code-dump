Republicans love to be holier than now

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:04.800
and talk about taking care of kids and keeping kids safe in school

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:08.300
yet they're the first ones to complain in any conversation about gun control

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.360
any conversation that threatens Second Amendment

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:15.940
like we are consistently consistently seeing children's lives be destroyed

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.080
because you wanna be able to shoot a gun

00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:20.000
they are the biggest bunch of hypocrites

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.560
I have ever had the misfortune of encountering

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:26.720
because you cannot say you care about kids when you are directly

00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:31.140
directly contributing to their trauma and loss of life

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.120
we're the only country that has school shootings as a part of our culture

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:36.080
if that is not the sign of a corrupt society

00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:37.374
I really do not know what is
