00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.840
Okay. Something I get so excited about is new to me. Vintage.

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.841
I love collecting vintage clothes,

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:07.241
and I was just commiserating with a mutual of mine

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:10.361
about how much I love vintage wool coats.

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:12.421
She had this beautiful emerald green.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.040
Emerald green coat with fur trim,

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:18.561
and I just so happened to decide I had to have something similar.

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:20.881
So I found it. I found it on Etsy.

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:23.601
Let's unbox it now. Does it get cold in Charleston?

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:24.681
Cold enough to wear, like,

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:26.041
multiple different wool coats?

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:28.361
Absolutely not. Absolutely not.

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.621
Does that matter? No.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.160
Oh. Oh,

00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:34.461
my gosh. Look at this.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.420
Look at this. Oh.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.120
Oh, my god.

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:43.021
Now this is so much prettier than I expected.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.880
This is incredible quality.

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:48.561
Like, the beautiful lining of it,

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:52.421
the fur. It's in fantastic condition for vintage.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.100
Um. Holy hell.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.180
This is. This absolutely stunningly saturated emerald green.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.120
Oh, my gosh.

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.141
And before I forget to tell you who I got this from,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.920
Jane Bay folk. Folk on Instagram.

00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.381
I love finding new vintage sellers,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.000
so go check her out. This was,

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.881
I believe, a under $100. Um,

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:17.621
so fantastic price.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.960
Oh, my gosh.

00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:21.921
I might get it taken in just a teeny bit on the sides,

00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:25.661
but I might not need to, depending on what I'm wearing underneath.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.480
This is. Whoa! Oh,

00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:29.661
let me button it.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.980
I am ready

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.060
for fall.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.540
Oh, I'm so excited.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.460
I love vintage. I get such a thrill. I love it.
