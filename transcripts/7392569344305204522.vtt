00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.380
On TikTok. Do it.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.160
Where is it though? On top,

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:07.141
up high.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.880
Put your hand in for the top.

00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:09.981
No, it's not.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.260
I didn't even have to hold. That's the heart.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.800
Chambers of the heart is. That's where it pumps blood.

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:21.321
Inside that, it's the heart right there.

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:23.801
Inside the heart would be the blood pump.

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:26.101
And then there's an artery that would take the.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.460
The blood around the chicken's body. Isn't that cool?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.480
Yeah. Someone from the chicken.

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.801
Isn't that cool? That thing,

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:37.201
that black thing reprises blood. That.

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:38.841
That blood. That black thing is a blood clot.

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.081
Cause it died and the blood started clotting up

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.861
cause it had nowhere else to go anymore.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.660
Just. Just touch it right here and see what the foul feels like.
