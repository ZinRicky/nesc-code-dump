00:00.600 --> 00:04.120
For one that will chop chilies.

00:04.120 --> 00:06.940
And that would be it. Thank you.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.180
Can I get three?

00:11.680 --> 00:14.560
What had the main reason I wanted to come to in and out

00:14.560 --> 00:17.000
because I've been seeing this little bad boy

00:17.000 --> 00:18.560
all over my for you page,

00:18.560 --> 00:20.160
and I've been violently craving it,

00:20.160 --> 00:22.340
even though I have no clue what it tastes like

00:22.400 --> 00:23.600
with all the ketchup.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.140
I got a fine Dutchman

00:25.360 --> 00:27.480
with the grilled onions on the outside.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.440
And then I also got my regular order,

00:29.440 --> 00:31.480
which is just a double double animal style

00:31.480 --> 00:33.220
protein style with chopped chilies.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.200
I'm more excited about the Flying Dutchman,

00:35.200 --> 00:36.640
so I'm gonna start with that.

00:36.640 --> 00:37.640
Do you wanna try it?

00:37.640 --> 00:38.360
Yeah, I'll try it.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.280
This is so hot.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.940
But this is what we're working with.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.620
So good. Holy crap.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.460
How was that?

00:57.840 --> 00:59.580
What do you rate that out of 10?

01:01.600 --> 01:02.580
Six or seven.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.020
That's pretty low.

01:04.320 --> 01:05.700
It's okay. I like it, though.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.720
I don't really like in N out fries,

01:07.720 --> 01:09.940
but I still eat them every time I'm here

01:10.320 --> 01:11.720
cause they're weirdly addicting.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.500
But they taste like cardboard to me.

01:13.840 --> 01:14.960
Yourself or for me?

01:14.960 --> 01:16.680
Um. We can share it. OK,

01:16.680 --> 01:20.100
it's a Flying Dutchman wrapped in whole grilled onions.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.880
Writing it in your notes? Yeah,

01:21.880 --> 01:22.800
well, I'm texting it too,

01:22.800 --> 01:24.700
so I don't forget.

01:25.160 --> 01:25.840
What am I getting?

01:25.840 --> 01:26.280
I'm getting.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.920
He just went in to get some more stuff,

01:27.920 --> 01:30.380
so we're getting another one of those Flying Dutchmen.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.360
He's getting himself his third double

01:32.360 --> 01:34.800
double He also got some milkshakes.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.180
And I think that's it.

01:36.480 --> 01:37.760
In my first trimester,

01:37.760 --> 01:40.160
I was craving in N out so much.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.400
And it's been like that with my other two pregnancies

01:42.400 --> 01:43.200
as well. Like,

01:43.200 --> 01:44.520
I could eat it every single day.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.760
And I. I did.

01:45.760 --> 01:46.900
I ate it a lot.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.480
And now it's not that much of a craving.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.200
I think secretly lucky loves the Flying Dutchmans.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.640
He just doesn't wanna admit it.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.440
But he got us another one

01:55.440 --> 01:58.260
without me having to ask. Ha, ha.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.100
It's the salt on top of the ketchup.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.820
The burger for me.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.140
I'm stuffed.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.660
Do you want the rest?
