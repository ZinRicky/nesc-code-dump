My husband has a weird obsession with Takis

00:02.521 --> 00:05.321
and can't go longer than a week without having them.

00:05.322 --> 00:07.321
When he opened his bag of Takis today,

00:07.322 --> 00:09.281
he realized that they all went stale,

00:09.282 --> 00:11.481
so I just decided to make him some.

00:11.482 --> 00:14.161
I combined some corn flour with some water,

00:14.162 --> 00:15.701
salt, and some sugar

00:15.720 --> 00:17.800
before kneading it and letting it hydrate

00:17.801 --> 00:19.761
while I made my spice mixture.

00:19.762 --> 00:22.521
I combined habanero powder with cayenne pepper,

00:22.522 --> 00:24.361
paprika, citric acid,

00:24.362 --> 00:27.681
some red beat coloring to give it that really red color

00:27.682 --> 00:29.121
before setting that aside

00:29.122 --> 00:32.481
and providing my dough into dime sized pieces

00:32.482 --> 00:34.361
and rolling them into little balls.

00:34.362 --> 00:35.801
Since they were all rolled out,

00:35.802 --> 00:39.321
I made sure to cover them with a damp towel while I worked on

00:39.322 --> 00:42.921
one piece at a time. Put my dough in between some plastic

00:42.922 --> 00:47.201
before pressing it flat and rolling it into that signature taki shape.

00:47.202 --> 00:49.081
And I kept repeating this process

00:49.082 --> 00:51.321
with all of my little pieces of dough.

00:51.322 --> 00:55.501
I then transferred them over to a plate while my oil was heating up.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.080
I made sure it reached 350 degrees

00:58.081 --> 01:00.001
before putting all of my chips in there

01:00.002 --> 01:03.501
and letting them get lightly more brown than I usually would.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.520
Toss them in my spice mixture and then they were done.

01:06.521 --> 01:08.441
These takis are Lucky's favorite snack.

01:08.442 --> 01:10.121
He was so excited to try them

01:10.122 --> 01:14.121
and he was so shocked at how much they tasted like the actual thing.

01:14.122 --> 01:16.941
And that plate was gone in under five minutes.
