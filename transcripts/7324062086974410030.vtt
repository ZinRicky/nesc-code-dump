00:00.080 --> 00:02.540
Here's everything my toddlers eat in a day.

00:02.600 --> 00:04.960
They eat whatever lucky and I are eating that day.

00:04.960 --> 00:07.020
I don't cook them any extra meals.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.960
And also, every day looks different.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.940
But today we started off our day by making some

00:12.160 --> 00:13.640
blueberry coconut granola

00:13.640 --> 00:15.680
to go on top of some Greek yogurt.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.760
So once the granola was all cooled down,

00:17.760 --> 00:20.760
I assembled their little yogurt bowls with Greek yogurt,

00:20.760 --> 00:22.200
banana, raspberry,

00:22.200 --> 00:23.600
and a drizzle of honey.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.360
They ended up snacking on the granola all morning long,

00:26.360 --> 00:28.620
so that was their mid morning snack.

00:28.840 --> 00:29.840
Then right before lunch,

00:29.840 --> 00:31.480
I pulled out my focaccia dough

00:31.480 --> 00:33.640
that had been resting in the fridge overnight

00:33.640 --> 00:36.220
just to let it rise at room temperature.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.960
My beverage of choice today was an asteroid with tea

00:38.960 --> 00:41.040
while I got started on some lunch.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.280
We have a lot of ground meat in the fridge,

00:43.280 --> 00:46.160
so I decided to make some wontons today.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.360
The filling was just pork, cilantro,

00:48.360 --> 00:49.120
spring onions,

00:49.120 --> 00:50.280
and then obviously

00:50.280 --> 00:51.760
the usual seasoning.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.720
I don't know what it was,

00:52.720 --> 00:54.440
but my wrappers kept breaking,

00:54.440 --> 00:57.720
so I decided to just leave my wontons as triangles

00:57.720 --> 00:59.440
instead of forming them properly.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.400
As a side, I made some sauteed broccolini

01:02.400 --> 01:04.320
and bok choy with some garlic.

01:04.320 --> 01:05.520
Once the wontons were done,

01:05.520 --> 01:08.200
I tossed them in my sesame soy dipping sauce

01:08.200 --> 01:09.860
and plated it all up.

01:09.880 --> 01:10.960
Their afternoon snack,

01:10.960 --> 01:12.520
they had some Parmesan cheese,

01:12.520 --> 01:13.720
olives, and some apples.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.760
The apples need to be sliced this way, though,

01:15.760 --> 01:16.960
or else They won't have it.

01:16.960 --> 01:17.960
I don't know why.

01:17.960 --> 01:18.600
At this point,

01:18.600 --> 01:20.640
my focaccia was ready to get dimpled,

01:20.640 --> 01:21.560
so I did that

01:21.560 --> 01:23.680
and topped it with some red onions,

01:23.680 --> 01:25.800
olives, and some cherry tomatoes.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.060
Pop that in the oven

01:27.360 --> 01:29.960
while I got started on some lamb meatballs.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.360
These were just ground lamb,

01:31.360 --> 01:32.040
Greek yogurt,

01:32.040 --> 01:32.760
some egg yolk,

01:32.760 --> 01:33.480
bread crumbs,

01:33.480 --> 01:37.120
seasoning, and then I rolled them up on a baking tray.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.000
Put those in the oven to broil.

01:39.000 --> 01:39.720
Once they were done,

01:39.720 --> 01:42.000
I started on my sundried tomato sauce.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.560
So I sauteed my onion,

01:43.560 --> 01:44.520
my tomato paste,

01:44.520 --> 01:45.960
sundried tomato paste,

01:45.960 --> 01:47.480
added some fresh tomatoes,

01:47.480 --> 01:48.840
and my lamb meatballs

01:48.840 --> 01:49.960
back into that.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.440
Focaccia was done baking.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.440
I sliced it up,

01:52.440 --> 01:53.600
and then it was time to plate.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.640
So I plated the meatballs with the focaccia

01:55.640 --> 01:58.283
and obviously had to add Parmesan cheese on top.
