00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.520
if your co parent immediately moved a new mommy in

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:08.701
and really try to drill it home to the kids to try to replace you

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.080
let me encourage you

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:14.181
it really doesn't matter how little the child is

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.640
you are their mother

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.001
they were created inside of you

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:22.641
there is a natural bond that that child has with you

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:25.981
they are never gonna see somebody else as Mama

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.460
think of all the stories of people looking for their natural birth mother

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.080
all these kids that got adopted

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.601
it was beautiful story still

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:36.621
but they still wanna try to find out who was their birth mother

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.600
there is a connection between a mother and their child that cannot be broken

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.121
here's another thing that will happen

00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:49.261
the kid might slip up and either call you this other woman's name or you might

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.600
uh here through the Grapevine that your child is calling the other person mom

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:57.261
either whether they slipped up or they're being taught to do that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.400
still doesn't matter

00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.521
it doesn't fucking matter

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:00.961
I can call an elephant a raccoon

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:03.301
it's not gonna make the elephant a fucking raccoon

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.800
your kid could call their fucking cup mom

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:08.081
it's not gonna make it mom

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:09.281
it's the same fucking thing

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:12.881
just because someone's teaching them or they're a little kid and

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:14.841
you know the back and forth and all around

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.721
sometimes you call your fucking teacher mom

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:17.621
you know what I mean

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.060
you can't let those tiny little things

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.880
ever try to convince you that your motherhood is less than what it truly is

00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:29.561
and it is an undying connection between you and your child

00:01:29.562 --> 00:01:31.081
that is your child

00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:32.781
think of your mother

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.200
whether you have a good relationship or not

00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:37.921
we always yearn for our mother

00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:40.841
that's why it hurts so bad sometimes

00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:44.361
you know so just remember that your baby loves you

00:01:44.362 --> 00:01:45.221
and it doesn't

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.740
does not fucking matter who comes in their life
