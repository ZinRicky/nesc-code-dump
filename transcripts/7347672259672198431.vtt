00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.320
I just find insecurity so boring

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:04.561
I don't know if it's because I did work on myself

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:05.841
and learn to love myself better

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:06.881
or if it's cause I'm a Leo

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:08.801
or it's because I'm burnt up from capitalism

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:10.321
but like the world is on fire

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:11.681
no one can afford to do anything

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:13.921
we have two eight year old men running for president

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:15.541
people can't afford groceries

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.860
and you want me to care that I'm fat

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.340
you want me to give a heck about my double chin

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.160
that that's what I should be worried about

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:25.481
you know maybe Jaden Smith was right

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:27.561
we should be worried about the political and economic state of the world

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:30.321
who has the time to be insecure

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:32.681
we have such little time to ourselves

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:34.841
and you want me to spend that time hating myself

00:00:34.842 --> 00:00:36.521
like hang out with your friend

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:37.921
go make out with someone

00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:39.521
read a book literally

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:44.001
doing anything is a better use of your time than sitting around

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.681
looking in the mirror and hating the thing that you're seeing

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:48.061
and no offense

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.360
I'm tired of talking about it

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:53.601
I'm so tired about hearing about everyone's insecurities

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:55.361
you have one body

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:56.881
you have one life

00:00:56.882 --> 00:00:59.041
don't waste it hating yourself

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:00.321
it's exhausting

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:02.721
and if that really is the thing that you wanna spend your time doing

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:03.961
fine do it

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:05.721
but don't make it everyone else's problem

00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:08.361
a and B for those of us who don't care

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:09.841
don't try and make us care

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:10.841
I'm happy with myself

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:12.383
why would I bother anyone
