00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.560
if you follow me and you know me

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.121
I just know you're gonna roll your eyes at me

00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:04.861
when I tell you that we're starting a 

00:00:04.862 --> 00:00:05.961
five day room renovation

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:09.081
I know and it's okay even I'm rolling my eyes at me at this point

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:10.521
and can I just say spoiler alert

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:13.381
but expect to see a lot of the unhinged thumbs up during this

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.800
so obviously it's a bedroom

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:16.601
but whose bedroom is it I hear you wondering

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.262
and why we got such a tight headline and 

00:00:18.263 --> 00:00:19.761
why is that cupboard so fkn messy

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:21.641
all valid questions I'm wondering the same

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:23.841
quick backstory once upon a time when I was 20

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:25.181
my husband and I had a baby 

00:00:25.182 --> 00:00:26.761
and that baby is about to turn 12

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:28.706
and his bedroom is easily the ugliest 

00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:30.601
bedroom we have in our entire project house

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:31.921
and this kid deserves the world

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:33.841
so for his birthday he's getting a new room

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:36.921
side note but never have I ever seen wallpaper come off this fkn easily

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:40.041
it was an absolute blessing and we stripped the whole room in 15 minutes

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:41.601
and cause we're doing this room on a budget

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:44.161
well let's be honest we're doing the entire house on a budget

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:47.121
but I'm gonna try and upcycle as many items from the old room as I can

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:49.801
starting out with this lamp from Kmart which I've had for about five years

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:51.801
I painted the lampshade Kohukohunui

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.601
and then I went in with te Horo on the base

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:55.241
and both of these colours are from Dulux

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:57.601
then this little side table holds a special place in my heart

00:00:57.602 --> 00:00:59.041
because about 20 years ago

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:00.144
it was my side table and 

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:01.601
aside from being a little bit old

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:02.961
there's nothing actually wrong with it

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.121
which is something I try and tell myself on the daily

00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:05.961
I don't know about you

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:09.241
but generally I feel better about myself when I have a bit of foundation on

00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:11.681
and I feel like the same theory applies with the side tables

00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:14.001
so I'm gonna paint her Crow Valley also by Dulux

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:15.601
and before the wood police come for me

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:17.161
can I just say it's laminate

00:01:17.162 --> 00:01:19.201
so no trees were actually harmed in the making of this

00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:21.041
and while I worked on my silly little side quest 

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:22.880
my husband did actual proper jobs like 

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:24.201
putting panelling on the wall

00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:25.841
anyway that's everything I had to show for day 1

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:27.601
but it does get significantly more impressive

00:01:27.602 --> 00:01:28.941
so come back for the update
