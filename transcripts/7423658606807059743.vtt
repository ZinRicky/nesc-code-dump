00:00.680 --> 00:01.840
Come along with me

00:01.841 --> 00:05.581
as I feed the calves at the dairy barn tonight with the kiddos.

00:05.680 --> 00:10.040
So we're starting off by getting the bottles nice and warm.

00:10.041 --> 00:12.841
These have been refrigerated all day,

00:12.842 --> 00:16.001
so we're putting warm water in the sink and just warming them up.

00:16.002 --> 00:18.961
The water the dairy is near boiling,

00:18.962 --> 00:20.501
it's so hot.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.680
But we also needed some additional milk for some more bottles.

00:23.681 --> 00:25.881
So Henry and I went into the robot room

00:25.882 --> 00:29.341
and diverted this cow's milk into the buckets.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.360
So this mama cow is getting milked in the robot,

00:32.361 --> 00:36.061
just eating her grain. We diverted her milk to the bucket,

00:36.280 --> 00:40.200
and then we carried it over into the bottle area

00:40.201 --> 00:42.801
and filled up more bottles with the warm,

00:42.802 --> 00:44.341
fresh milk from Mama.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.420
Then we put all the nipples on,

00:47.560 --> 00:49.120
put the bottles into the cart.

00:49.121 --> 00:53.081
I also drained the water with this handy dandy tool that we got

00:53.082 --> 00:55.801
so they don't have to put my hand in the boiling hot water.

00:55.802 --> 00:57.181
It's amazing.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.120
And then we were off. So we held the cart outside.

01:01.121 --> 01:03.421
We started with the first group of calves.

01:04.360 --> 01:07.960
They were very appreciative of the warm bottles.

01:07.961 --> 01:10.001
These calves are just a few days old,

01:10.002 --> 01:12.541
so they get, um,

01:12.840 --> 01:14.960
the smaller bottles. But these calves in here,

01:14.961 --> 01:17.821
actually getting a gallon of milk twice a day.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.240
And it's a party in the calf barn.

01:21.241 --> 01:22.881
Like, everyone loves to be in there.

01:22.882 --> 01:29.361
These calves are so cute, and we all love to Love on them and feed them.

01:29.362 --> 01:32.641
Our kids especially love the calf job.

01:32.642 --> 01:36.501
So this is Lois, she's changing all the water and the feed.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.200
Then we came into the barn

01:38.201 --> 01:43.661
and we started filling up bottles of warm water for the calves.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.440
Cause the kids were doing that.

01:45.441 --> 01:47.701
I was entertaining Miss Floor Joe,

01:49.040 --> 01:50.780
put warm water in the bottles,

01:51.080 --> 01:54.380
put clean nipples back on.

01:55.080 --> 01:58.440
And Flor and I are taking a milk break

01:58.441 --> 02:01.421
as the kids finish their bottles.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.440
And then we were off. Round two.

02:04.441 --> 02:07.821
At this point we started accumulating some of the kids friends.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.740
It was becoming more of a party.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
But the best thing about bottle raid raised calves,

02:14.001 --> 02:17.021
in my opinion, is how friendly they are.

02:17.280 --> 02:19.680
They're the cutest, most friendly little things.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.881
And I love it so much cause they just let you pet them.

02:21.882 --> 02:25.001
It's the best. Then we went back into the barn,

02:25.002 --> 02:26.421
washed all the bottles.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.260
And then in the main barn,

02:29.280 --> 02:34.120
Daniel was working on reuniting lady with her calf.

02:34.121 --> 02:39.261
So our goal for this dairy is to get all the mamas with their babies,

02:39.880 --> 02:41.040
um, from birth.

02:41.041 --> 02:44.121
So in typical commercial dairies,

02:44.122 --> 02:47.401
they separate the calves just as for management reasons.

02:47.402 --> 02:52.001
But we really want our dairy to have a mother calf operation.

02:52.002 --> 02:53.681
So we're tinkering around with that,

02:53.682 --> 02:55.661
trying to figure out the best way to do that.

02:56.480 --> 03:00.520
Then after that, we had some friends showing kids magic tricks.

03:00.521 --> 03:03.041
We were cleaning up and then we Were off.

03:03.042 --> 03:05.481
Everyone loaded up, started heading home.

03:05.482 --> 03:08.681
We gave Haas a very long rub.

03:08.682 --> 03:10.961
Haas loves rubs. And then we were off.

03:10.962 --> 03:13.461
He was not wanting that end.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.080
We ran home. I wanted to show you guys.

03:17.081 --> 03:21.441
I had for the occasion, my cow and milk hair clips,

03:21.442 --> 03:22.621
which I love.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.480
And then Daniel eventually showed up.

03:25.481 --> 03:27.401
After he finish his chores.

03:27.402 --> 03:30.341
So that was tonight's night in the dairy barn.
