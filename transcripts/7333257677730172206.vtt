00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.600
That the person who is expelled

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.200
the human being

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:02.880
from their body

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.240
gets to pick and choose who they want around.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.280
Oh, my god, yes.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.480
Can we have this conversation?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.880
The entitlement that some people feel

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.080
to a child that is not their biological child,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.680
it is, in fact,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.000
their grandchild, is insane.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.200
I had pretty serious boundaries

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.920
when it came to the birth of my children.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.940
I still have some pretty serious boundaries

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.280
around the care and keeping of my children.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.040
But I'm gonna take this

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.320
conversation even a step further.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.540
Grandparents are not entitled to their grandchildren

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.120
at really any phase.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.500
You are not owed those children,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.400
but definitely not around the birth.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.640
Birth can be traumatic,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.480
they can be hard to heal from,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.200
they can be psychologically damaged,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.640
and they are extremely vulnerable

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.200
and intimate experiences.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.460
You have to feel so safe and supported

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.800
in that vulnerable moment

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.520
by every single person that is around you.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520
That may or may not include your in laws,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.200
your siblings,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.280
or your own parent.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.880
And anyone who has a problem with that

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.320
is outing themselves on their own sense of entitlement.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.480
The grandparent relationship

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.480
will always be an extension

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.240
of the relationship you have with your own children,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.013
because no one owes you their baby.
