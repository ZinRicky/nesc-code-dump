00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.920
so for those of us breaking toxic family cycles

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:04.580
have you heard the phrase

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.040
I hope your kid is just like you now

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:07.920
I didn't hear this

00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:10.940
my scapegoat older sister heard this her whole life

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.520
and actually

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:12.720
when I had my first born

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.880
I had it said about my daughter because she

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:20.280
my daughter was very similar and still is to my older sister like oh no

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.680
she's just like Sarah

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:23.200
using my sister as

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:26.040
like the negative comparison

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.800
and you know what I realized through all this

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:29.380
it's actually really messed up

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.740
I love my daughter

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.380
and I realised my reactions to her behaviour were something I had to fix

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.720
and I have re parented myself

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:41.160
and I'm still in the process of re parenting myself and becoming a respectful

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:43.180
gentle parent for her

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.540
so all of that comparison only showed me

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.100
that my parents weren't willing or able to do the work required for my sister

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.540
and that was the failing of a parent not a kid
