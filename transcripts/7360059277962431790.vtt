00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.760
my sister knows me

00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:16.021
she is the one that was there through my SuperWhoLock phase

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.160
through my emo phase

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.161
through my one direction phase

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:19.321
and now you know

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:20.481
10 years later

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.601
she's the one who's here post college

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.561
like watching me become a person

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:25.801
and I'm doing the same with her

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:31.001
like my little sister is the valedictorian of CAS NYU right now

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.181
and we just had this conversation about how like

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.400
her friends from college

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.001
like they know her now

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.501
but they didn't know her when she was in high school

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.040
and her friends in high school

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:43.101
they don't really know fully who she is now

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.020
and we were like

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.120
we know each other

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:48.761
we're the only ones that are gonna always know each other

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:51.641
because we are the only ones that are gonna be in our lives forever

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:52.321
you know

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:55.641
I have immigrant parents and they really stressed family when I was growing up

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:57.521
and me and my sister weren't always the best of friends

00:00:57.522 --> 00:00:58.041
we're always friends

00:00:58.042 --> 00:00:59.441
but not not the way we are now

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:00.321
and now we're roommates

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:02.521
like she is the most important person in my life

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:03.961
hands down I would do anything for her

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:05.121
I love her so much

00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:06.721
my parents really stress like friends

00:01:06.722 --> 00:01:07.481
they come and go

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:09.161
but like your family

00:01:09.162 --> 00:01:13.141
your sister is going to be the person at your side at all times and

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.460
I love her so much
