00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.420
I mean it really does boil down to the girls that get it get it

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.440
and the girls that don't talk shit and they're jealous about the other ones

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.901
like there's there

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.960
the easiest thing in the world is to get a man

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:16.401
the it is not a fucking flex to say you got a man

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:19.541
the real flex is to say you actually did something with your life

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.760
Ruth Bader Ginsberg

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:21.721
that's a fucking flex

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:22.281
she was married

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:23.441
do we know who the fuck he is

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:25.061
no Dolly Parton

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.500
she's a major fucking flex

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.120
do you know who her man is

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:31.321
no but she's had one for like 20 some fucking years

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.601
it's like a beautiful little love story

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:33.961
who gives a fuck about that

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:38.921
cause the real flex is doing something with your life

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:41.401
realising you're in a shitty situation and you gotta get out

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:44.461
realising you're worth more and you deserve more and you're gonna get more

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.240
the easiest thing in the world is to get a man

00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:51.561
there are women in nursing homes that have been incapacitated for years

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:52.481
and end up pregnant

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:53.121
you know why

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:56.621
cause it's not hard to get a man

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.070
