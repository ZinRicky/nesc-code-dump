00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.320
When my husband requests tacos for dinner,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.680
I take it very seriously

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.760
because I don't wanna fail his Mexican roots.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.760
And authentic taco starts with the quality

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.560
corn tortilla,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.960
and store bought just won't do.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.200
That's because your typical

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.880
grocery store corn tortilla is made from GMO corn,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.040
and then it's loaded with gums and preservatives.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.520
I'm going to next analyze regeneratively farmed

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.360
heirloom blue corn,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.680
which is a process that involves

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.520
cooking the dried corn with water and cal,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.800
then letting it sit overnight.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.320
After washing the corn to release debris and skins,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.000
I get to grinding the corn into masa.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.120
I'm using a hand cranked Molino first,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.760
which will get me a chunky masa,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.140
but then I'm going to move to the.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.120
This is the tool that ensures the masa is super fine

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360
so that the end resulting tortillas are soft

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.120
and flexible and bursting with flavor.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.720
And now it's time to shape the masa into tortillas.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.240
I'm using a tortilla press,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.080
although you can also just use your hands.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.160
With a bit of practice

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
you'll be able to get quickly round tortillas

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.520
because that's really important.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.800
Storing the hot tortillas in a towel while you make the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040
entire batch helps them to soften up even more

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.360
so they're bendable for tacos

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.818
just like the ones at the store.
