00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.580
One of the things that I wish women would.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.040
Would women and people that I think would help with loneliness,

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:10.561
with everything, is people are so obsessed with romantic love,

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:14.561
as if romantic love is the only kind of love there is in this world.

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:19.401
And I think that's why single moms can be such a fucking threat to men.

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:23.041
And that's why single moms get rejected or whatever,

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:25.641
is because we don't need you.

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:28.961
I have all the love in the world that I could ever want or need

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.241
with my children. They love me and I love them.

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:35.661
My heart is full and fulfilled everyday because of my children.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.560
I don't need a man to pay my bills.

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:39.161
I can walk through this world

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.041
and provide everything that I need for myself.

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:42.401
So if someone's gonna come into my life,

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:44.081
it's because you add something to it.

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:46.121
It's because I actually like you.

00:00:46.122 --> 00:00:50.561
It's because there's more happiness in my life with you in it

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:53.741
than without it. And most men can't offer that to women.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.200
And that's why I think people get so.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:58.781
Women will get so sad and depressed.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.560
But just taking the focus off of romantic love

00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:07.081
and looking at all the love you do have in your life,

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:10.161
and even if you don't have that many people in your life,

00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:12.801
you should love yourself enough to.

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:14.961
To really feel yourself to be like,

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:19.741
I'm good, I'm good. I don't need to accept

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.240
shit like Literal shit like abuse,

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:26.421
like name calling, yelling,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.200
intimidation and aggression.

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.081
And pretend that that's love.

00:01:30.082 --> 00:01:32.761
Because I just don't wanna look and face myself

00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:34.861
and face my inner self and my.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.680
My bits and pieces. Do you know what I mean?

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:42.441
Like it's not romantic. Love isn't the end all,

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:45.881
be all of life. There should be other forms of love in your life

00:01:45.882 --> 00:01:47.121
that fill you and fulfill you.

00:01:47.122 --> 00:01:50.781
So that you're not so desperate to try to attain this one love.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.120
And it also helps with the feelings of loneliness.

00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:58.441
So I hope instead of finding a man,

00:01:58.442 --> 00:02:02.141
I hope you find yourself and fall in love with yourself.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.280
Cause that's ultimately

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:06.645
what will get you everything that you want in life.
