00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.320
here's the thing

00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:06.760
when thin people come to talk to fat people about the issues with obesity

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:09.100
they are almost never

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.440
ever saying something that we don't already know

00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:19.980
right because growing up fat means that you are so cognizant of your health

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.760
and of the issues of obesity

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:23.640
and you know what's good

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:28.160
I probably have more understanding of nutrition than the average thin person

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:31.340
because of the amount of nutritionists and dietitians and like

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.640
personal trainers that I have personally seen

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.440
I stopped dieting in the last six years

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:38.360
and this is the first time in my life that I have been a like

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:39.720
consistent maintain weight

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:41.480
up until six years ago

00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:45.880
I was consistently my entire life gaining weight

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:48.120
because I would always gain weight

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:48.760
gain weight gain weight

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:50.240
lose weight gain weight

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:51.600
lose weight gain weight

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:52.840
lose weight but that

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:54.120
that that weight that I

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.280
I kind of you know

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:56.360
after I lost and I gained I

00:00:56.361 --> 00:01:00.120
I was always more than what I had started off with right (typical of yo yo dieting)

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:01.200
so I had a really

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:02.920
really bad relationship with food

00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:08.660
and it wasn't until I started to decided I wasn't gonna die anymore

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.400
and I was gonna eat intuitively

00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:13.200
and heal my own feelings and relationship with food

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:17.380
that is like what the best that I could have done for *my* health right

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.620
and people love to come on to my page

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.560
and act as if I do not know what health issues are associated with being fat

00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:28.280
there are fat people that work out

00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:29.440
that eat healthy that

00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:30.840
you know go to the gym

00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:31.400
that that

00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:33.600
that skip eight hours of sleep at night like

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:34.200
you know what I mean

00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:36.960
there are fat people that I believe are healthy

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:39.540
 I'm very mentally ill

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.860
don't really go to the gym

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.800
have a really bad sleep schedule

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:43.320
have like

00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:46.520
violent ADHD that impacts every single aspect of my life

00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:47.820
like my

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.720
most of my health

00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:51.760
my the worst part of my health isn't even my fatness

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:53.560
it is my ADHD right

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:56.160
because it impacts every aspect of my life

00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:59.140
so when you come into a fat person's comments like

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.880
I mean my doctor like

00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:01.600
we are locked in

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:03.920
we I have regular checkups

00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:05.800
I have regular blood work done

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:06.360
I like

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:07.600
I take my medication

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:09.640
I me and my doctor

00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:10.720
we talk about my shit

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:11.400
you know what I mean

00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:15.680
ah you don't need to know the details of my personal health

00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:19.500
and when you come onto a fat person's page and say

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.920
did you know that's actually bad to be obese

00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:22.760
babe like

00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:25.800
we are very well aware of our health right

00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:28.340
and then people who may not have the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.940
privilege to go to doctors and have medications in the way that I do

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.680
what how are you benefiting them

00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:36.080
you are not giving fat people any new information

00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:36.880
when youâ€™re like

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.680
obesity is actually bad

00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:39.880
babes like

00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:41.040
oh my god

00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:42.200
especially when you're like

00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:44.360
comments are unwarranted and unwanted

00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:46.040
if that person is like hi

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:47.560
I'm struggling with obesity

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:48.440
and I would like

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:50.240
you know to deal with my health issues

00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:52.560
I you know do you have any information

00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:53.240
can you help me

00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:55.041
whatever you do that 

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:57.700
you guys have that conversation

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.420
but if you're randomly giving *unsolicited unwanted advice* to fat people

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.520
that's where the fatphobia comes in

00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:07.800
because why is this random person's body any of your business

00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:10.720
it's not it's not hope that help

00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:13.920
moral of the story is don't give people unsolicited health advice

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:15.080
that's that's

00:03:15.081 --> 00:03:15.774
that's the issue
