00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
A couple weeks ago I got a haircut that was definitely too short.

00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:06.481
My bangs are a lot shorter than I want them in.

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:09.601
The back of my head is something that I don't even wanna talk about.

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:14.081
So in order to fix it, I need to make my hair grow as quickly as I can.

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:16.801
I started by making some Rosemary water.

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:20.361
Let my Rosemary simmer in some water for about 15 minutes,

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:23.921
let it cool, and then transferred it over to my spray bottle.

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:27.801
Once that was set aside, I started on my Rosemary hair oil.

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.321
I combined some olive oil,

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:31.821
but you can also use avocado or coconut.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.440
Put some clean Rosemary sprigs in,

00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:36.721
let that infuse on a double boiler,

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:40.721
and about 45 minutes later take it off and let it cool.

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:42.201
I combined some argan oil,

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:44.001
jojoba, vitamin E,

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.481
sweet almond oil, and some peppermint oil.

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:49.201
Poured in my Rosemary infused olive oil,

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:51.581
gave that a good mix and bottled it up.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.280
Spray the Rosemary water all over my scalp

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:56.381
and also the length of my hair

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.280
before the oil,

00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:00.907
massage it into my scalp and let it sit before washing it out.
