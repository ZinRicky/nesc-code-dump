00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.680
what is it with guys immediately coming on to dating apps and starting off like

00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:06.800
very vulgar and sexual

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:10.160
and like don't say it's because I'm fat because I know that my like

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:11.560
thin friends like

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:12.480
also received this

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:13.000
and just like

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.920
what happened to like charm

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:18.580
you know what happened to like class

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.020
what happened to

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.880
I don't know flirting

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:23.400
like I just like

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:25.660
why do men feel as other entitled to people's bodies

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.760
like I just don't understand how we got to this point of like

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.080
sexual liberation

00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:32.180
we're like

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.540
women are being treated as objects again um

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.640
and you know

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:41.960
men are treating whoever they want as objects for their own sexual gratification

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:42.560
like I'm sorry

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:43.280
there's nothing like

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:45.480
liberating or respectful

00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:49.620
or desirable about a man thinking that

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.440
the first message they send a person should be inherently sexual and

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:57.160
like degrading in nature

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:57.680
it like

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:03.080
I don't deny that this is probably exasturated because I'm fat

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:04.980
I don't deny that literally in the slightest

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.000
however I know that my thin friends also experience this and also have like

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.720
inherently very sexual and like

00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:15.400
do meeting messages as like

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.540
openers on dating apps

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.160
and I just don't think that like

00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:22.160
that is something that we should be allowing

00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:24.320
I don't know I'm not like a brood

00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:25.200
I really am not

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:26.080
but like what

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:27.080
I just got a message

00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:28.880
oh my god like

00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:30.000
that's your opener

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.600
are you insane

00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:34.160
have you ever spoken to a human being ever before

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:40.260
like literally all of my friends who date men have experienced the same thing

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.440
and so I know it's not just a

00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:43.720
like me being fat thing

00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:45.260
like I know that for a fact

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.000
I just like

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.320
don't understand why this is behavior has become normalized

00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:50.040
like I

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:50.960
I don't know like

00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:51.680
also just like

00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:52.760
not as fun right

00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:53.760
like like

00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.200
I'm sorry but I'm not gonna lie

00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:58.000
I think a big part of like

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:01.040
the fun is the like tension

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:01.600
it's the like

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:02.480
will they won't they

00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:04.280
it's the getting to know each other's

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:05.800
the flirting it's the like

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:07.680
I don't know it's the process of getting there

00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:10.800
and then just now we live in a world where it's like oh

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:14.040
you know you imagine a dating app and immediately you're just gonna have sex

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:14.860
it's like

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.120
controversial

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:17.320
no like

00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:18.520
what if we had a conversation for us

00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:19.560
what if you know

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.120
you spoke to a human being

00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:22.480
I don't know I don't think it's much to ask

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:23.440
I really don't think it's much to ask

00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:24.960
I don't think I asked for much

00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:27.260
and I think most of us don't ask for much

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.950
I just think it's degrading
