00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.960
Exactly. To all the cute little 20 something girls being like,

00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:09.241
let them do for be, cause we'll still be having babies

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:12.561
and we'll be raising babies and will bitch.

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:15.741
Some of us did have those babies,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.860
realized the bullshit we were participating in,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.800
left that shit, and now we're raising four babies in this world

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:25.401
to believe what we believe.

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:28.321
Just like you can radicalize your fucking babies,

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:32.601
there's people on the other side doing the same fucking thing.

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:35.881
They're learning from me as well.

00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:38.441
Don't think that all feminists don't have kids.

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:42.961
Some of us are making up for our childless sisters. Okay?

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:44.361
I had four kids

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:49.221
and believe that all of them are gonna be raised to be kind hearted,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.820
empathetic people who understand community and love.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.296
There's many of us out there.
