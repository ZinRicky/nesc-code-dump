00:00.320 --> 00:02.500
Making some bread. Today

00:04.280 --> 00:08.380
we're making two batches of four loaves.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.120
Oh, and I also wanted to let you know

00:13.120 --> 00:16.000
that our five pound bags of flour are.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.740
Are restocked in the new packaging.

00:20.200 --> 00:20.680
Okay, Charlie,

00:20.680 --> 00:22.560
we're gonna go grab some.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.900
Charles, gonna go grab some bags so you can see.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.760
Okay, here's the flower,

00:51.760 --> 00:53.780
you guys. My new

00:55.160 --> 00:59.340
packaging. Oh, my goodness. High protein farm flour.

01:02.440 --> 01:05.500
How cute are these bags? How cute are these bags?

01:06.560 --> 01:07.780
I'm obsessed.

01:08.800 --> 01:14.060
Okay, so this is the flour that we use for our sourdough.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.400
And what I love making my sourdough bread with

01:19.400 --> 01:22.260
because it's a strong flour and so

01:23.480 --> 01:26.180
it just does so well with the bread crushing
