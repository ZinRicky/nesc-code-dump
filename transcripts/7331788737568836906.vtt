00:00.080 --> 00:00.920
Okay. Last week,

00:00.920 --> 00:03.160
Democrats in California introduced a Bill that

00:03.160 --> 00:06.680
would ban the sale and the use of rodent glue traps.

00:06.680 --> 00:07.640
According to the Bill,

00:07.640 --> 00:09.560
these glue traps are very inhumane,

00:09.560 --> 00:11.020
and they're not nice.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.240
Now, I know you're probably wondering,

00:12.240 --> 00:13.120
like, aren't there

00:13.120 --> 00:15.120
bigger problems facing Americans right now? Like,

00:15.120 --> 00:16.920
shouldn't the politicians be focusing on something else?

00:16.920 --> 00:17.920
And you're probably right.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.360
But I do wanna talk about this for a minute,

00:19.360 --> 00:21.800
because these are the exact same people who,

00:21.800 --> 00:23.560
back in 2022,

00:23.560 --> 00:24.760
almost unanimously

00:24.760 --> 00:27.580
voted in favor of a Bill that allows abortion

00:27.840 --> 00:28.960
up till the point of birth

00:28.960 --> 00:30.040
for any reason,

00:30.040 --> 00:31.220
no questions asked.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.240
Now, however you feel about that law,

00:33.240 --> 00:34.400
however you feel about abortion,

00:34.400 --> 00:35.280
general, pro life,

00:35.280 --> 00:36.520
pro choice, whatever,

00:36.520 --> 00:38.760
have you ever heard a Congress person,

00:38.760 --> 00:39.600
a politician,

00:39.600 --> 00:43.000
anybody, advocate for more humane abortions?

00:43.000 --> 00:45.200
Have you ever heard anybody question

00:45.200 --> 00:46.160
how abortions are done,

00:46.160 --> 00:47.400
and are they done humanely

00:47.400 --> 00:49.040
and as the fetus feel the pain?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.480
Because the science behind

00:50.480 --> 00:52.960
when a fetus can feel pain is constantly changing,

00:52.960 --> 00:54.880
and it gets earlier and earlier and earlier.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.120
It's just wild to me that in this country

00:57.120 --> 01:01.220
we prioritize literal rats above human beings.
