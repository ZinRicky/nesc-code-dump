00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.960
We ended up, you know,

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:04.401
having an abortion. And it's so weird to say

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:08.201
because I didn't realize that until the Dobbs decision.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:10.701
When John and I were talking about it in bed one day,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.160
and I was talking about it from a place of.

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.561
I feel so bad for people, for other people,

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:19.601
for them. That anyone's ever had to go through that,

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:24.301
and they. They're not able to make a choice about their own body. And.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.860
And he was like, well,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.060
you had an abortion. I was like, what?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.180
I had no idea. That language wasn't used in.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.440
In the room that I was in.

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:34.321
It was never said by my doctor.

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:36.261
It was never said by anyone around me.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.400
Um, so I just assumed that I had miscarried.

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:39.601
I didn't even realize. And I.

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:40.721
I honestly felt so ignorant

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:43.101
for not having known that for so many years,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.800
um, that I didn't know what was happening to my own body.

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:49.001
But I think that word is so scary to people.

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:51.161
It's so taboo to talk about.

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:55.001
And so I think by you speaking out about it,

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.921
by being here and all of us speaking out about it,

00:00:56.922 --> 00:01:00.061
and knowing that millions of women around the world

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.360
make this decision for themselves,

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:05.981
and hearing stories from your clinic,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.240
hearing that so many women come in there,

00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:10.721
and it's not a place of sadness all the time.

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:15.321
It's not a place where people are feeling their darkest points or

00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:17.001
Anything like the world wants you to think.

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:20.141
Some people go in there with so much hope and so much sorry

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.980
and so much excitement because they know that they have a future.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.400
And maybe there are so many people,

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.501
like mand and I, that wanted our baby so badly.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.240
And it's okay. What happened to us is okay.

00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:36.881
But we can't let this happen to other people.

00:01:36.882 --> 00:01:39.301
We cannot let people not have this choice.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.560
Sharing all these stories and humanizing this taboo subject,

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:47.549
I think, is really an important thing. Sorry.
