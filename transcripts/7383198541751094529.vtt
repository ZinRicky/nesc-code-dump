00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
on any given day

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:02.361
you should probably be sending 

00:00:02.362 --> 00:00:03.680
thoughts and prayers to my husband

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:06.200
because this man has the patience of an actual saint

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:07.960
and if you've been following any of this series

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:10.000
you will know that this room has been torturous

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:10.920
but let's be honest

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.600
it's probably been torturing him more than it's been torturing me

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:15.120
and today just for shits and giggles

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:16.843
I thought we could torture him together 

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:18.480
with the world's most difficult sheers

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:20.000
The sheers normally? not that hard

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.998
but in this room? extremely fkn problematic 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.440
because we have a raked ceiling

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:24.520
but low window heights

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:26.161
and weird measurements and other things 

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:27.720
that I don't care to understand anyway

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.280
so we've got the same freedom S fold sheers 

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.240
in the dining room

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:31.517
which is the room off this one 

00:00:31.518 --> 00:00:32.960
which has an extremely high ceiling

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:34.400
so in that room they're perfect

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.000
but in this room

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.777
we pretty much needed to cut them in half 

00:00:36.778 --> 00:00:37.920
and also cut all the tracks

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:39.689
but the fabric comes with these little strips 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.920
so you can just cut them to size

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.520
iron that on hang them and then youâ€™re away

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.000
it's super easy apparently

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.780
I don't actually know cause I was no help at all

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.126
my job was to be the tester for quality  control 

00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:50.480
and I can confirm they passed

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:53.520
but this white rug unfortunately did not pass the vibe check

00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.960
I absolutely adore this rug

00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:56.240
it's thick it's cosy

00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:58.320
I'm gonna pop it in my daughter's room but for now

00:00:58.321 --> 00:00:59.960
the dimensions are just all wrong

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.280
there's a bit of a backstory and maybe I'll tell you one day

00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:05.260
but the long and the short of it is we needed a bigger rug to fit this space

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.520
because this side of the room has kind of a weird layout

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:09.120
it's pretty long but pretty skinny

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:10.160
and I'm not sure if you've noticed

00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:11.285
but my couch is enormous 

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:13.400
somebody even commented and said it was too big

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:16.120
and you could be right but also all we do here is sit

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:18.630
and I could either have a ton of extra floor space 

00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:19.960
or a ton of extra ass space

00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:21.880
and I chose the ass space, obviously

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.720
cause there's five of us and we often have guests 

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:25.480
and we all need somewhere to sit anyway

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:27.240
the new rugs centred it all really nicely

00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:29.662
and I promise you'll get the full reveal in the next part
