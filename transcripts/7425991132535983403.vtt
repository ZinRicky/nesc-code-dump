00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.000
okay I just hopped off the treadmill because I had to respond to this

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.080
because this is the conversation that needs to be had

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:09.760
no mother who is sympathizing with the woman with the 17 diapers

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:15.460
is saying that an environment with 17 dirty diapers is healthy for an infant

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.320
no one saying that it should not be the standard

00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:19.920
however the conversation that is having

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:23.140
and the conversation that is so much more important

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.060
than how many dirty diapers were in her house

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.200
is how we get to this point

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:30.000
as women and mothers and caretakers

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:35.200
how women have these babies are left to emotionally and physically drown

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:39.560
until there are physical tells of how bad they're doing

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:41.040
that's when people pay attention

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:45.380
and instead of paying attention for it being a symptom of a larger problem

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.600
um they only look at the symptom

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:49.000
which could be dirty diapers

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.520
which could be postpartum depression

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:52.320
which could be a mental breakdown

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:55.120
and then shame the mom for having those problems

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.840
17 dirty diapers is a symptom of a larger

00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:01.060
more dangerous problem with maternal mental health

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.260
and that's why that should be the focus of the conversation that we're having

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.560
not whether or not 17 diapers is disgusting

00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:09.200
cause it's bigger than that

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:10.960
the conversation is bigger than that

00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:14.920
if we keep focusing on the 17 diapers or the mental breakdown

00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:16.960
or the woman who hasn't showered in three weeks

00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:19.840
we are gonna miss the opportunity to actually make change

00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:22.160
and actually help people and I agree

00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:26.080
the baby's other parent very important part of this conversation

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:27.560
but that is not the only person

00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:30.814
who is supposed to make up the village for the new mother
