00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.480
I don't think people realize

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:04.080
how bad the devastation and the life loss is gonna be

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:05.360
in western North Carolina

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:08.800
for a while most people didn't evacuate

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:10.480
there was no evacuation order

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:13.640
they weren't ready for this and now they are stranded

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:17.400
I've been seeing reports of people on mountain tops

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.120
calling them mountain islands

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:22.220
because they can't get down cause the roads are roaded away

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.620
the only lucky thing is that people in southern Appalachia are resourceful

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.980
and they help their neighbors

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.720
and they have a lot of like skills

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:33.680
so prepping food preservation

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:34.700
I just

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.160
some of the towns me and my family visited many times are just completely gone

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:48.180
it is just a resting this feeling of like shock and helplessness

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.400
in the meantime it is like a sunny

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:52.500
beautiful day in Charleston

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.740
it just seems so bizarre for them to have gone Hurricane and not us

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.180
like it's just

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.300
this is bad

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.860
and this is

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.246
it's gonna be worse than we think
