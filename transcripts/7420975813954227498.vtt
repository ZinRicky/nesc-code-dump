00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.420
American women

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.920
god designed you this way you

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:05.320
I don't…I don't care

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:08.000
if you like to hear this or not it doesn’t really matter

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:13.300
god designed you this way so it is the way it is right but

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.320
your number one priority…the first thing

00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:18.860
your first priority should be taking care of a man

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.280
and the first…your first priority should be taking care of an American man

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.200
he reminds me of this table book that I have

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:27.400
it's called Are Men Obsolete

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:31.880
and it's actually a transcript of a debate that took place in 2013 in Toronto

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:35.000
and the debaters look at just how much gender norms have changed

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.220
in the last 100 years so for tens of thousands of years

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.640
men were just assumed to be the dominant secks

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.840
and they primarily relied on law

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:47.600
religion and brute force as a means to force women to stay with them

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:52.080
or make it nearly impossible for women to lead a life without a male companion

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:54.200
but everything has changed in the last 100 years

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:56.480
women have came bursting into all of these spaces

00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:58.280
that we were historically excluded from

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.560
so the workforce education politics

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.880
sports everything

00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:08.240
and a lot of men just haven't adapted instead of just evolving

00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:09.840
there's a whole group of men

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:14.440
like this creator who are just trying to bring back the good old days

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:17.900
trying to once again use religion to tell women that god

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.040
(conveniently also a male had a male son

00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:24.000
and his 12 male best friends) all said that your purpose

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.480
and your highest priority

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:26.680
should be to serve men

00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:30.120
they're trying to bring back laws that we know have the consequence

00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.700
of making it harder for women to leave male partners

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.640
by eliminating access to abortion and reducing access to contraception

00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:39.280
conservatives are also trying to make it harder to get a divorce

00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:41.520
they wanna end no fault divorce

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:46.160
and it should be noted that women initiate nearly 70% of divorces

00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:47.800
so if you make it harder to get a divorce

00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:52.080
you are disproportionately impacting women's ability to leave male partners

00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:55.060
anyways recommend this little book here

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.160
really short uh

00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:00.422
if you get it let me know what you think.. are men obsolete?
