00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
I'm a lesbian, but I used to date men

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.161
and there's a lot in the media at the moment

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:04.361
about violence against women

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:06.921
and the man or the bear in the woods scenario.

00:00:06.922 --> 00:00:09.521
And I've got a story that I think is really applicable to it,

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:11.441
although I never thought I would tell it on social media.

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:12.721
Back when I was a young pup,

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:14.861
I was on Tinder and I match with this fella.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.600
It was very, very early Covid.

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:18.361
We agreed to catch up. He drove to me

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:20.001
and we were just gonna go out and get coffee

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:21.361
and sit somewhere and drink it.

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:23.121
I was always someone that would like to go out in public,

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:24.921
but Covid didn't allow us to do that.

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:26.561
He then drove to where I lived.

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:29.001
I met up with him and we met in a car park

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:30.601
and I asked him to jump in my car.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:33.361
He drove a 79 series cruiser and I drove a Ranger.

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:34.561
And he, it was like, oh,

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:36.321
I'm a chippy and I've got tools in my car.

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:38.441
Like I really can't, I can't leave this here.

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:41.401
Can we take mine? And based on like the situation with the tools,

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:42.241
I was like, oh,

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.241
you know what, that's probably fair.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.481
That's alright. We'll go in your car.

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:46.081
So I jumped in his car. We went and got coffee

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:48.741
and we headed out to this like quiet sort of lookout area.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.960
We were just having a conversation.

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:50.561
It was Alright,

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:52.681
everything was good and then suddenly within like half an hour,

00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:53.201
he's like, alright,

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:54.701
well, are we gonna do this or what?

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.080
Oh, it's hot.

00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:58.681
I remember looking at him being like, what?

00:00:58.682 --> 00:00:59.321
And he was like, well,

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:00.281
this is why we're here, isn't it?

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:01.561
And I was like, no,

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:02.721
like we're just going on a date.

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:04.361
And I remember him just being like,

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:05.401
no, that's not why we're here.

00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:08.441
And he got quite tense and I was like shit.

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:10.881
I was like, I'm out in the middle of nowhere and this guy's car,

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:12.881
he wants to do something, I don't wanna do it.

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:13.721
What am I gonna do?

00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:15.801
I remember explicitly thinking about the things that could happen

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:17.521
and there was five different things that could happen.

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:19.081
Number one, I say I'm not interested and he goes,

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:19.641
yep, all good,

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:20.041
no worries

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:22.361
and we either continue talking or he takes me back to my car.

00:01:22.362 --> 00:01:25.041
No. 2, I say no and he does it anyway.

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:28.221
No.3, I say no and he bashes the shit out of me or worse,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.720
No. 4, I say no,

00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:31.201
he leaves me on the side of the road.

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:34.641
Or No. 5, I just do it and I go home and I feel like shit about myself.

00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:35.981
Those are my five options.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.440
Now out of those five options,

00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:39.521
only two of those outcomes that I like

00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:40.921
thought were relatively favorable.

00:01:40.922 --> 00:01:42.961
One was that he accepted it and took me home

00:01:42.962 --> 00:01:43.681
and two is

00:01:43.682 --> 00:01:45.941
That he left me on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.080
the other parties I Learned early

00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:48.721
if you just do what they want you to do

00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:51.321
you go home and you feel like absolute shit about yourself

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:53.121
and then you have to wear that that's on you

00:01:53.122 --> 00:01:54.521
they walk away feeling freaking great

00:01:54.522 --> 00:01:56.721
and you go home feeling like shit however

00:01:56.722 --> 00:01:58.681
most women would still rather go through that

00:01:58.682 --> 00:02:00.681
then get the absolute shit fucking beaten out of them

00:02:00.682 --> 00:02:01.921
or potentially even worse

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:04.621
or be forced to do it at least if we are complicit

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.280
we at least get to go home and say well

00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:06.801
I wanted it

00:02:06.802 --> 00:02:08.921
I chose to do it I don't know what I was thinking that night

00:02:08.922 --> 00:02:09.721
but I was like nah

00:02:09.722 --> 00:02:11.721
fuck yeah I'm not doing it and I said no

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:14.801
and he he cracked the sheets and he left me on the side of the road

00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:16.961
and the fact that I got left on the side of the road

00:02:16.962 --> 00:02:19.201
in the middle of nowhere and I was like man

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:22.521
I got lucky in this situation is absolutely disgusting

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:24.801
there's a few things that I've Learned from this story is No. 1

00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:26.701
every time I've told this story to a girl

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.560
they've got extremely similar situation

00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:31.481
but nine times out of 10 they just did it they didn't say no

00:02:31.482 --> 00:02:32.521
and the second part of the story is

00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:33.161
I'm actually being scared

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:35.601
that telling this story to people is Actually

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:38.081
not interesting enough because it's so common.

00:02:38.082 --> 00:02:39.401
It's something that happens to everyone.

00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:40.401
That's not interesting enough

00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:43.201
or it's not significant enough to talk about to other people

00:02:43.202 --> 00:02:44.681
because everyone has seen worse,

00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:45.281
which is, again,

00:02:45.282 --> 00:02:46.401
horrifying fact

00:02:46.402 --> 00:02:48.241
that most women would choose to be left alone in the woods

00:02:48.242 --> 00:02:50.601
with a bear over a man in 2024

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:53.721
when we are such a developed species is actually fucked up.

00:02:53.722 --> 00:02:56.041
I'm not gay because of my negative experiences with men.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:56.801
But I tell you what,

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:59.181
it's really nice not having to worry about them as much.
