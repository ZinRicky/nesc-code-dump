00:00.080 --> 00:02.400
I make fresh butter at least once a week,

00:02.401 --> 00:05.361
so let's make some roasted garlic and parsley butter today.

00:05.362 --> 00:08.081
I start by roasting my bulb of garlic in the oven

00:08.082 --> 00:11.001
and then pour some heavy cream into my Kitchen Aid.

00:11.002 --> 00:13.601
I whisk it on a low to medium speed at first

00:13.602 --> 00:15.861
while I chop up my parsley.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.120
I give it a good chop

00:17.121 --> 00:20.621
and make sure that it's small enough to incorporate into the butter.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.840
Once my heavy cream reaches this stage,

00:22.841 --> 00:25.601
I turn up the speed to a medium high speed

00:25.602 --> 00:29.041
and just let it go until the buttermilk separates.

00:29.042 --> 00:30.121
Once that happens,

00:30.122 --> 00:33.901
I turn my mixer off and my butter is pretty much done.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.840
Can use a strainer or your hands to just get all that buttermilk out.

00:37.841 --> 00:40.761
Just make sure you get as much of it out as possible.

00:40.762 --> 00:44.161
A lot of the times I ask lucky to come help me with this

00:44.162 --> 00:45.961
since I'm not that strong.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.921
Once all the buttermilk is pressed out,

00:47.922 --> 00:50.561
I transfer my butter over to a plate,

00:50.562 --> 00:52.281
sprinkle it with some parsley,

00:52.282 --> 00:53.481
my roasted garlic,

00:53.482 --> 00:54.881
some flaky sea salt,

00:54.882 --> 00:57.481
and make sure that it's all incorporated

00:57.482 --> 00:59.521
before I transfer it over to the fridge.

00:59.522 --> 01:01.461
And some wax paper to store.
