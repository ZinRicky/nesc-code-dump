00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.600
did you know what a prolapse is

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.401
for all the cute little girlies that wanna have like

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:09.701
four or five kids and they just wanna be a stay at home mom

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.560
and just love on their babies and raise them

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:15.941
here's a few things you maybe never thought of

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.800
first of all

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.781
like top one on the list

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.640
did you know what a prolapse is

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:23.541
I want you to Google that word

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.320
and I want you to understand what a pelvic floor is

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:30.561
and how weak it gets with every child you have

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:31.841
so you know when women like

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:33.721
joke about peeing when they cough

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:35.281
that's a sign of like

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:37.201
your pelvic floor is being weak

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:39.401
and when your pelvic floor is weak

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:46.721
you're at risk of your fucking insides falling out of your vagina and like

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:50.861
you can see them look it up and read stories of

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.120
and it is fucking

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:59.841
I didn't learn about it until after I had four kids

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:02.801
all of which were eight pounds or more

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:05.361
one of them was one ounce shy of 9 pounds

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:07.741
I've had some big fucking babies

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.900
and I had four of them

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.400
that's when I understand I haven't

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:13.361
thank god I'm not there

00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:15.581
I haven't gotten to that level and we're

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.880
that's why I go to the gym

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:18.381
I anyway anyway

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.480
that is a side effect that can happen when you have multiple children

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:23.701
let's talk about more

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.960
if you do not take care of yourself when you're pregnant

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.001
and give yourself all the nutrients that you need

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:31.561
that's why you're supposed to take a prenatal vitamin and blah blah blah

00:01:31.562 --> 00:01:34.701
all the fucking bullshit you're supposed to take and do while you're pregnant

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.180
if you don't

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.920
the baby comes first

00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:39.401
it is almost

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:41.601
quite literally operates like a parasite

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:45.881
it it it sucks at all of the nutrients to the baby

00:01:45.882 --> 00:01:47.861
everything goes to the baby

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.000
mom kind of gets what's left over

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.281
so a lot of times

00:01:51.282 --> 00:01:54.721
moms can have teeth issues and hair loss

00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:58.441
because everything went to the baby for those nine months

00:01:58.442 --> 00:01:59.441
and you just like

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:00.241
didn't realize it

00:02:00.242 --> 00:02:02.381
and your body wasn't responding well

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.040
you know what I mean

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:04.401
it's like super fun

00:02:04.402 --> 00:02:06.001
super fun super fun

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:07.241
also not to mention

00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:09.801
you don't really get to decide if you have a vaginal birth or a cesarian

00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:10.681
so even if you're like oh

00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:11.801
I'm not gonna push the baby out

00:02:11.802 --> 00:02:13.121
that's not always your choice

00:02:13.122 --> 00:02:15.041
and even if you do decide to get a cesarian

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:19.061
that's major abdominal surgery

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.480
they're literally ripping your whole body

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:24.741
your skin your muscle

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.260
your or your

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.560
fucking your uterine

00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:31.781
everything gets cut open for the baby to come out

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.200
it's not like

00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:35.721
the easy way out

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:38.961
or like a fucking it

00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:40.241
I don't know what you think it is

00:02:40.242 --> 00:02:41.601
but it's not what you think it is

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:42.441
do you know what I mean

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:46.801
so all you cute little girlies in your 20s

00:02:46.802 --> 00:02:49.881
this is just a little public

00:02:49.882 --> 00:02:55.545
service announcement from a well seasoned mama of four
