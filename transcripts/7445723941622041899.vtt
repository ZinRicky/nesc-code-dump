00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
I am so sick of hearing the universal post election take. Um,

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.081
that the left just needs a new Joe Rogan,

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:12.521
when in fact the left needs an entire new media ecosystem.

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:15.461
Trump didn't win the election because of one bald,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.960
you know, transphobic podcaster.

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:21.541
He won the election because there's a very organized,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.240
very well funded group of donors

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:29.441
who fund propaganda machines cosplaying as media companies.

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:30.681
I wrote about it on my sub stack.

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:31.681
Just take the Daily Wire.

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:35.281
It got 4.77 million in seed funding from the Will Brothers,

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:36.001
if you don't know who that is.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.281
They got rich from fracking.

00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:39.121
They also donated to Bragger AU

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:42.001
which is like a content farm factory, um,

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:45.121
that cosplays as a um, university.

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:46.701
And then there's Project Veritas,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.000
which is known for uh,

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:49.641
literally fraud. Um,

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:50.761
and they got a point.

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:52.401
One point seven million dollars from Daughter's Trust,

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:53.561
which is the Cook Brothers.

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:55.561
And then there's Russia. Who can forget about Russia?

00:00:55.562 --> 00:01:00.081
They gave uh, right wing influencers up to $100,000 for one video.

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:01.461
Who could forget Elon Musk?

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.840
I don't even wanna get into it.

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:06.181
I mean literally. But the right isn't just well funded,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.720
it is also willing to lie.

00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:09.721
It is not just well funded,

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:11.361
it is also willing to cheat.

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:12.481
Left doesn't have a regard or dog

00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:15.301
because we would never lie on national television

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.680
and create a national conspiracy

00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:19.061
that our candidate lost the election because it was stolen.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.080
The left, um,

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:22.081
isn't winning because We're too progressive.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.441
Or um, you know,

00:01:23.442 --> 00:01:25.341
we don't have enough male podcasters.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.200
There's a. There's a lot already.

00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:28.041
The left is losing

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:31.681
because we are trying to copy the other teams playbook

00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:33.241
when they are cheaters. So

00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:34.701
instead of self modulating

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.720
and trying to copy what the fascists are doing,

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:38.761
we should also play dirty.

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:42.761
That means that the left needs to enter its insufferable. Tara. Um,

00:01:42.762 --> 00:01:43.601
you know, yes,

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:47.521
Joe Biden parting his son is a good start.

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:49.761
But why stop at your family um.

00:01:49.762 --> 00:01:53.481
When you could pardon all abortion related crimes? Um.

00:01:53.482 --> 00:01:56.181
And activists and doctors.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.900
Instead of wagging our finger at Donald Trump's immigration policy, um,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
Joe Biden could spend the next few weeks that he has an office

00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:06.081
closing down the very detention centers

00:02:06.082 --> 00:02:09.121
that Donald Trump needs to deport millions of people.

00:02:09.122 --> 00:02:11.161
We have to stop uh,

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:14.561
imitating the rights playbook and we need to actually start uh,

00:02:14.562 --> 00:02:18.121
outsmarting them and being not very demeanor and not very mindful.

00:02:18.122 --> 00:02:19.221
That's how we win.
