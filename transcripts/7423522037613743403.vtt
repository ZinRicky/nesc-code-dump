WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:02.700
We did it. Yep.

00:03.080 --> 00:04.340
You done it.

00:05.520 --> 00:08.160
So many people have been raving about these

00:08.161 --> 00:10.941
and saying that they're good, so,

00:11.600 --> 00:13.400
uh, I'm terrified.

00:13.401 --> 00:15.121
I actually don't know what they look like.

00:15.122 --> 00:17.081
I just got a flavor of each.

00:17.082 --> 00:20.181
Apparently, they rotate flavors every week. Okay,

00:23.040 --> 00:24.940
this is what we're working with.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.320
I'm actually really scared.

00:26.321 --> 00:27.841
Why am I sweating right now?

00:27.842 --> 00:31.361
I don't know. I'm not too sure what any of these flavors are.

00:31.362 --> 00:33.321
I know we have, actually. Remember,

00:33.322 --> 00:36.121
I think this is something with peanut butter.

00:36.122 --> 00:39.001
This is the classic chocolate chip one.

00:39.002 --> 00:42.201
Then I think this is the chocolate chip oat one.

00:42.202 --> 00:43.561
Oh, that sounds good.

00:43.562 --> 00:46.901
Sunday brownie. I think pumpkin something.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.840
Ooh, pumpkin is haunting us.

00:49.841 --> 00:50.641
Pumpkin something.

00:50.642 --> 00:53.161
And then this is the one I'm actually the least afraid of,

00:53.162 --> 00:55.081
which is Oreo. Okay,

00:55.082 --> 00:57.901
what do we start with? The brownie. Cause it looks.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.980
I mean, it could be worse, actually.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.680
What do you rate it? Uh,

01:10.681 --> 01:12.241
it's a. It's literally a brownie to me,

01:12.242 --> 01:13.981
so I don't know. I rate it brownie.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.220
So this is the pumpkin one.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.560
I like that. That's nice.

01:21.561 --> 01:22.361
Hmm.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.720
Reminds me of my childhood for some reason.

01:24.721 --> 01:27.441
The frosting is so good. Holy crap.

01:27.442 --> 01:28.721
Oh, it is real good.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.021
What do you rate that? 1 7.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.280
That's pretty high for you.

01:33.281 --> 01:36.121
Let's try this Oreo one. Why are you making that face?

01:36.122 --> 01:37.861
This one's gonna be the best one.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.180
This is the Oreo one.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.820
But you don't like either.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.060
That one wasn't good.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.820
Okay, let's try this one.

01:54.920 --> 01:55.680
I. Okay.

01:55.681 --> 01:57.001
I don't wanna try the peanut butter one.

01:57.002 --> 01:59.381
You have to. I don't like peanut butter at all.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.460
Hmm.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.440
What do you rate that one?

02:05.441 --> 02:08.221
27. 27. I give it a two.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.580
It's like another butter. I don't know what that is.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.440
Here. For the frosting,

02:16.441 --> 02:20.061
honestly. Just a classic chocolate chip. Cheers.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.340
Very classic.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.300
You make better cookies.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.460
Great thought. A6.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.080
A6, too, right?

02:32.081 --> 02:35.221
Yeah, I think oatmeal chocolate chip.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.060
I'm not even trying these anymore. I've given up.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.380
A 6, too.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.740
I give that a 6. I mean,

02:46.920 --> 02:49.140
the chocolate chip ones are pretty tied.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.080
Which one was your favorite overall?

02:51.081 --> 02:52.681
The peanut butter. Really?

02:52.682 --> 02:55.121
All the way to me, weirdly enough.

02:55.122 --> 02:56.101
Pumpkin one.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.400
Really good. Hey,

02:58.401 --> 02:59.601
what do you give this overall?

02:59.602 --> 03:01.921
Like, is this worth the hype?

03:01.922 --> 03:04.841
I give this overall experience a 6 or a 7?

03:04.842 --> 03:07.741
Like, would you pay 32 bucks for this again?

03:08.040 --> 03:11.600
Oh, because I wouldn't get three out of the six you got.

03:11.601 --> 03:13.241
Peanut butter one was very good.

03:13.242 --> 03:15.101
Very delicious, very nutritious.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.560
Very amazing. Very awesome.

03:16.561 --> 03:18.341
Very good. Lovely.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.420
Good job. Wow,

03:20.560 --> 03:23.120
you're so animated. Okay,

03:23.121 --> 03:25.613
good job. I need to go sleep. Bye.
