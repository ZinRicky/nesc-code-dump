00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.000
I am not one to film people in public,

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.881
but crossing the street right now

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:07.041
in front of me is this woman who looks like a literal Barbie doll.

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:09.441
She is probably in her 50s,

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.441
but she looks immaculate. Low rise,

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:14.041
flared jeans, blonde hair,

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:17.921
bouncy curls. Fucking gorgeous. Stunning.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:24.301
The man she's with looks like a backwards weeble wobble,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.480
um, who's also one foot out of the grave.

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:30.241
And I just think it's so interesting

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:32.601
that we are so accustomed to seeing that,

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:37.321
we're so accustomed to seeing women who look fucking perfect

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:38.081
with men

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:41.621
who look like they crawled out of some sort of primordial ooze

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.560
that we don't even blink an eye.

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:46.001
Right? But if we were to see the roles reversed,

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.081
if we were to see a handsome,

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:51.461
stunning, perfect 10 of a man with a woman who is like

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.680
maybe a half step lower than him on the general beauty standard

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:59.001
attractiveness scale, they would eat her alive.

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:01.081
People would have so much to say about it,

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:02.761
because we are not used to seeing that,

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.921
and we don't like seeing it,

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:08.381
and it's absolute nonsense.
