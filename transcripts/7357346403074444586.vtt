If you hate getting hangovers then this video is for you

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:06.501
My mother taught me this and her mother's mother taught her this.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.960
This is a hack on how you can avoid hangovers

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:12.521
I come from a family who are big drinkers

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:13.001
big time

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:16.841
 there's always uncles popping a cerveza on the weekends

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:20.481
or you're tía (aunt) getting a little too lit at the quinceanera

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.281
or even just a regular baby shower

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:23.561
so we know how to get down

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:25.801
and I can say that because I'm a Latina woman

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:29.921
listen up, here's how to avoid an incurable hangover

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:30.688
do not drink 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.281
don't hair of the dog anything

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.521
you’re just getting drunk again

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:35.801
if you don't wanna wake up the next morning saying 

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:36.741
Ay dios mio (oh lord)

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.880
having to go to work with shaky hands

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:40.581
then don't drink

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.960
life changing advice here

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:44.521
but if you're looking for reasons on how to avoid hangovers

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:47.681
then why not look at that as a sign of why you shouldn't drink

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:49.846
alcohol is literally poison

00:00:49.847 --> 00:00:50.568
 de nada!💃🏻
