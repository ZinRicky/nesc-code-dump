00:00.080 --> 00:03.000
Husband doesn't cook, but he does make tacos sometimes.

00:03.001 --> 00:04.001
So he went to the store,

00:04.002 --> 00:05.561
pick me up my favorite drinks,

00:05.562 --> 00:08.681
and got started on making some steak and fish tacos.

00:08.682 --> 00:10.681
Started by pickling some onions,

00:10.682 --> 00:11.601
setting that aside

00:11.602 --> 00:15.081
while he started chopping some cilantro to make a mango PICO.

00:15.082 --> 00:17.401
I always get scared when I watch him chop stuff

00:17.402 --> 00:19.281
because it looks very dangerous,

00:19.282 --> 00:21.321
but so far he's always gotten it done.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.921
He moved on to chopping up some tomatoes.

00:23.922 --> 00:26.281
I'm so excited that summer's rolling around

00:26.282 --> 00:28.481
and it's gonna be tomato season really soon.

00:28.482 --> 00:31.081
I don't know what it is about a good tomato anyways.

00:31.082 --> 00:32.081
He chopped them up,

00:32.082 --> 00:33.721
added them to the bowl with the cilantro,

00:33.722 --> 00:36.001
before moving on to peeling the mango.

00:36.002 --> 00:36.721
After peeling it,

00:36.722 --> 00:40.981
he cut it in slices and then dice them up as small as he could.

00:41.080 --> 00:44.280
Decided to only add one mango because he didn't want it too sweet,

00:44.281 --> 00:46.241
but he wanted that little burst of flavor.

00:46.242 --> 00:50.001
So after that was all chopped up, he moved on to yellow onions.

00:50.002 --> 00:51.361
If that rough chop as well

00:51.362 --> 00:54.341
before combining it all with some lime juice,

00:54.400 --> 00:56.160
heen and some other spices

00:56.161 --> 00:59.761
before taste testing it and making sure that it was all good to go.

00:59.762 --> 01:01.361
It's actually really, really good.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.181
I had a little bit of it as well,

01:03.320 --> 01:06.440
and he started prepping all of his toppings, which was some cheese,

01:06.441 --> 01:08.181
lettuce, some Fresno chili,

01:08.200 --> 01:08.920
some limes,

01:08.921 --> 01:12.681
and he set it all out before Moving on to searing off his protein,

01:12.682 --> 01:15.061
he got some New York strips and put them in the pan

01:15.200 --> 01:17.240
to get an even sear on both sides

01:17.241 --> 01:19.721
before basting them in butter and garlic.

01:19.722 --> 01:20.801
Once those were done,

01:20.802 --> 01:23.141
he set them out to reverse season

01:23.440 --> 01:26.200
and rest while he got started on his fish.

01:26.201 --> 01:27.401
Any white fish will work.

01:27.402 --> 01:28.801
Whatever you have in the fridge,

01:28.802 --> 01:30.641
and he seasoned it with some lemon,

01:30.642 --> 01:32.441
lemon pepper, and salt.

01:32.442 --> 01:34.041
This felt like the home stretch.

01:34.042 --> 01:35.961
He warmed up the tortillas,

01:35.962 --> 01:37.161
sliced his steak,

01:37.162 --> 01:39.441
and then it was time to assemble the tacos.

01:39.442 --> 01:41.201
These were so good.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.581
Exactly what I wanted.
