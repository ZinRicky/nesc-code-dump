00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.640
Today I decided I needed a break.

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:04.521
I'm in a funk. I do not feel motivated to get our school work done,

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:05.881
so we're just gonna not do it.

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:07.601
Next week was already a scheduled week off

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:09.401
before we jump in for the new school year,

00:00:09.402 --> 00:00:11.001
so why not take an extra few days off?

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.841
The beauty of year round schooling is that when we get in these moods,

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:16.181
or particularly me, I get in these moods,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.520
can take time off to refresh.

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:19.681
I do my kids a disservice when I'm trying to teach

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:21.441
from a point of frustration anyway,

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:22.801
so it's just better for all of us.

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:25.081
So for the next week, I'm gonna get together with friends,

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:26.961
read lots of books, do things that I enjoy,

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:30.070
to get myself in a good headspace before we start again on August 5th.
