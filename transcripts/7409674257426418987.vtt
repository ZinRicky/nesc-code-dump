00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
I posted this on my Instagram stories today

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.240
because Hirsch Goldberg is one of these victims

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:06.761
that they found killed in Gaza.

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:08.401
They were hostages from October 7th.

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:10.281
If you don't know, Hirsch is an American citizen

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:13.021
and his parents had been working tirelessly

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.080
to work towards a thieves fire

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:18.281
to get their son home. I had heard so many stories through social media,

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:20.281
just about what kind of man he was,

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:21.721
about his parents love for him.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:27.921
So there is a deep sense of loss knowing that he will never come home.

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:31.841
And of course a few people came into my DMs to tell me that

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:34.321
it's a disgusting thing that I'm doing

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:35.661
to even recognize

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.280
um, these deaths when there's so many deaths happening in Gaza.

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:43.961
And the crazy thing is I have posted more about Gaza times 100

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:45.941
then I posted about the Israeli hostages

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.400
because

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.781
I felt that the weight of the devastation that was happening in Gaza

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.040
required more attention at this moment.

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:54.681
But I feel like I just have to say this.

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:57.601
I will not diminish anyone's humanity

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:01.081
in order to justify the violence of either side.

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:03.961
There's no justification for me

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:06.581
for the amount of devastation happening in Gaza.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.720
And there is no justification for me for taking innocent hostages

00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:12.301
and murdering people at a music festival.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.600
You can disagree with me, but I think when you dehumanize people

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:19.001
and you take away the significance of their life and their death,

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.081
you are down A slippery slope.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.461
So I can hold

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.680
empathy and grief for the innocent people being held hostage

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:28.681
and being killed,

00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:33.801
and still hold empathy and grief for the thousands of innocent gossams

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.561
being bombed now too.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.681
I still have two gofundme's in my account,

00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:40.561
but I would really like to hit their goals and get their family

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:41.802
and them to safety.
