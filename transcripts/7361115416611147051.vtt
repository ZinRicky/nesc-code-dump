00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.960
you can disagree with me

00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:02.241
but I just find it so weird

00:00:02.242 --> 00:00:05.241
the way that people exploit their children on the internet for views

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:06.001
likes followers

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.101
money whatever

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.120
like I just watched a video of this like maybe 4 year old girl crying like that

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:13.981
a million likes

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.720
like a million likes and this girl

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.041
I think she had a face paint stuck on her face

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:18.641
could get it off

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:20.881
whatever and like she's like crying right

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:22.861
and I get that it's funny I just

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.420
also like why

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.240
why are you filming your child likely experiencing something that's like

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:32.341
traumatic to them

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.400
like obviously it's frivolous to you because you're an adult and you know

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.481
logically yes

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:38.301
this face paint will come off

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.760
but this is a child who does not understand that this face paint will come off

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:45.681
cause it's not coming off right now and she is like scared right

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:48.241
and again I know it's a frivolous thing and I know it's funny as an adult

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:49.861
but like I just

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.120
I don't know like

00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:52.761
I remember growing up and being a child

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:58.461
and being laughed at by adults when I was upset about something or whatever

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.500
and like

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.360
that never felt good right

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:03.081
like I don't

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:06.081
so I just don't understand what the point is of like

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:08.961
making fun of your child and then not only doing that

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:09.881
like posting it to the internet

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:11.241
I get but you know

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:12.321
I'm not I'm not a mother

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:14.801
so maybe you guys have different feelings

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:16.321
but it just I don't know

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:18.181
makes me feel icky right

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.600
like filming your child and posting to the internet is already weird to me

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:24.921
I don't think that children's faces should be on the internet frankly

00:01:24.922 --> 00:01:27.181
cause there's a lot of freaks and weirdos on here

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.180
but using like getting a video of your child crying for likes

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.334
not for me sorry
