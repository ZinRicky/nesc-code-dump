Okay, I'll show you what I've been making every morning.

00:04.760 --> 00:10.860
So I squeeze some lemons first. The two lemons.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.460
And I have this

00:14.720 --> 00:15.860
chlorophyll

00:18.400 --> 00:20.620
put in 14 shakes

00:29.280 --> 00:33.180
then. Okay, so then I put a little bit of maple syrup in,

00:39.040 --> 00:41.860
and then I put some of our new, um,

00:42.760 --> 00:47.340
blueberry, petal and lemon. French saltine.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.540
Stuff is so incredible.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.380
Just put a pinch of this in

00:55.800 --> 00:57.140
my electrolytes

00:59.080 --> 01:00.140
on the bench.
