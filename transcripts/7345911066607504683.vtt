00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.600
All right, so I wanted to stop by

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.520
little manic episode of cleaning and organizing

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.480
to answer this question,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.280
because I don't think I've ever

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.140
actually talked about my experience with having ADHD.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.520
Um, medication,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.540
not medication,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.880
etc. So I was diagnosed at,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.920
I believe, 8 years old.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.880
I was in third grade,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.000
because my mom worked in the medical field

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.160
and kind of had, like,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.320
behavioral health kids,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.420
behavioral health as, like,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.960
a niche focus of her medical career.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.360
So I think I got diagnosed

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.680
earlier than most people around my age.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.640
When I got diagnosed,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.040
I was diagnosed with ADHD,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.400
which is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.280
And I immediately started going through

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.900
and trying every drug that they had out.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.880
At one point,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.800
I was on Adderall,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.800
I was on Concerta,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.720
I was on Vyvanse when that came out.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.920
I was on short acting,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.080
I was on time release.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.600
And all of that was great. Honestly,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.140
I don't think I would have graduated college without it.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.320
But. And here is like,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.040
a big trigger warning or, like,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.440
just take this with a grain of salt.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.300
This is my personal experience.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.980
This is not to say anything about

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.600
medication versus no medication.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.360
This isn't supposed to sway anyone one way or the other.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.300
This is just what happened to me and what works for me.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.880
First of all,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.840
I developed, um,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.480
heart palpitations and an irregular heartbeat

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.920
in my later teens.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.360
I wanna say,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.920
like, 19. So much so,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.160
That I had to wear heart monitor for about a month

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.000
just to like,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.040
check everything,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.960
make sure everything was fine.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.820
It was fine.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.440
But being on stimulant

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.160
since you're 8,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.060
every single day, like,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.560
maybe not spectacular for, like,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.560
all the body parts.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.480
So after college,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.720
I was working in kitchens

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.520
and I was working 12 hour shifts.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.120
I would take my adderall, I,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.240
you know, I would take.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.000
I think at that point

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880
I was on 40 milligrams of Tymerlese,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.800
five amps. And

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.840
to be honest,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.380
it was too much.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.080
But I had moved away from my doctor.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.520
I didn't wanna get a new doctor.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.960
I had really shitty health insurance.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.760
I was young,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.680
and my husband,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.240
who, like, is a wonderful,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.040
wonderful man,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.820
but, like, has no experience with neuro divergence,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.640
was like, why don't you just try being off of it?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.320
Because I wouldn't take it on my days off.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.320
And my personality was completely different

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.820
on it versus off of it.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.640
Hence why I think

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.600
I was over medicated,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.320
because it shouldn't change you in,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.200
in that way.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.880
So when I switched from working,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.000
like, line cook work

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.880
to catering,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.320
and I could make kind of my own schedule

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.200
of my own hours

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.880
a little bit more,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.340
I got off of all my medication.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.640
And really shortly after that,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.560
I became pregnant.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.320
And I didn't wanna go back on any stimulants

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.000
or any medication

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.560
while I was pregnant

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.240
or breastfeeding. And. Haha,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.200
had a second Baby

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.020
really close together with my first.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.040
So I went from breastfeeding to another pregnancy.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.440
So when all that was said and done,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.960
there was like

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.480
five years later

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.520
and I had just become accustomed to not being on it.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.540
And I was also dealing with other mental health issues

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.920
which. Sorry,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.040
this is really long winded.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.240
I developed, um,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.760
postpartum anxiety

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.400
and I think

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.080
a little bit of postpartum OCD.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.200
So it kind of counterbalanced my ADD

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.340
because instead of being, um,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.440
neurotically,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.020
like, manic and then,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.280
and then lethargic and overstimulated,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.400
I was just OCD

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.520
for the first time in my life.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.540
And I was like, oh,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.620
I got all this together.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.340
No, it was mental illness.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.800
Fast forward to now.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.580
Um, I'm fully over being postpartum with my last baby.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.800
And I have noticed that when I'm driving,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.680
when I'm listening my kids, I'm like.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.200
I literally noticed I was driving

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.760
and not paying attention to driving

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.120
because I was so distracted with my thoughts and like,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.500
my, like, musings,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.320
and that made me nervous.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.320
I also feel like my ability to like,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.480
be present is really difficult because of my ADD, ADHD.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.460
Um, and so is the overstimulation.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.360
And I feel like I was missing out on things

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.080
with my kids.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.920
I wasn't able to, like,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.900
calm the noise and just be.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.480
So I am back on medication.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.080
Um, this is very new for me.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm starting with, like,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.640
really, really,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.960
really low doses

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.440
because my Biggest fear is getting to a point of, like,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.360
aggressive over prescription again.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.240
And I've Learned my body a lot better

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.080
now that I'm an adult

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.300
and I don't have another adult telling me

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.360
what's right for me.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.160
I can make my decisions on my own

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.600
and what dosages, um,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.840
are affecting me in which way.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.760
And I'm much more in tune with my body.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.000
So I'll keep y'all updated on how medicated Lisa

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.180
in adulthood goes.
