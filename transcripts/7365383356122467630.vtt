00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.480
literally like Christmas guys

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:03.941
I have to show you what I got from TJ Maxx

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.360
so first I got jewelry

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:06.841
I'm gonna start with the good things first okay

00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:10.921
I got this 14 karat gold ring

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:12.241
these little hoops

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:13.281
basically my mom

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:14.161
when she came to visit

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:16.041
brought me my baby bangles like

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:16.801
which were gold

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:18.101
like from when I was a kid

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.920
um and they're like

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:20.081
really cute really small and like

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:21.281
the perfect size for hoop

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:22.201
but I didn't wanna get them like

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:23.601
customized into hoops

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:24.761
didn't wanna ruin them

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:28.561
um so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put them through here and I'm gonna hang it

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.761
and it's gonna be like a little baby bingle as a hoop

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:31.521
and it can be so cute

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:34.701
so I'm gonna show you what I bought and then the things that I left behind

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.520
um okay

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:40.481
normally I typically only buy real gold and real silver um

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:41.781
cause I want to last right

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.880
however

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:47.121
there's no reality in which I think I can afford this in real gold anytime soon

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:48.301
and I just couldn't pass it up

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.620
you're like

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.060
it was $13 you know what

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.680
I'll take care of them

00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:59.761
I'll make sure they don't rust or go bad

00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:00.961
I just think they're really pretty

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:02.401
so I had to get them

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:03.581
and I broke my little

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.040
you know my little rule

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:08.461
but honestly so worth it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.640
okay I got this for my sister

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.921
this is I don't even to um

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:13.481
Urban Outfitters

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:15.581
this is the perfume that they have urban offered

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.920
this is the perfume like

00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:18.961
line they have Urban Outfitters um

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:20.801

00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:21.681
um my sister

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:24.241

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:25.161
she loves it um

00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:25.681
so that's for her

00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:26.921
I if they had the matcha like

00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:28.081
by itself I would have bought it

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:29.141
but you know

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.240
whatever I got

00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:32.441
I know the food at TJ Maxx is like

00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:34.541
very risky um

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.160
but I love this brand of chocolate um

00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:39.561

okay um

00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:08.561
this obviously needs like a liner or something

00:05:08.562 --> 00:05:10.781
but love smells good too

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.220
love that it's a little like hmm

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.820
watery

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.000
I think it's intentional

00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:18.901
but I don't know why

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.440
my lips blushed again because I'm looking pale

00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:25.581

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.100
yeah

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.920
and you know

00:05:39.921 --> 00:05:43.961
I don't love the way my lips look without liner when I put on colored gloss

00:05:43.962 --> 00:05:45.261
but cute

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.300
um I like that little

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.200

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.760

00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:55.441
my god I love the gloss that I got

00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:56.441
okay um

00:05:56.442 --> 00:05:58.621
I got this from mom

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.080
my mom like

00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:01.241
is obsessed with these shoes

00:06:01.242 --> 00:06:02.401
like this specific brand

00:06:02.402 --> 00:06:03.821
it's like a like

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.080
Clark's knockoff

00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:07.241
not knockoff it's like a Clark's brand

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:08.201
and they're like sandals

00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:09.281
and my mom love

00:06:09.282 --> 00:06:09.881
she lives in Florida

00:06:09.882 --> 00:06:10.401
so this is like

00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:12.241
what she wears literally every day

00:06:12.242 --> 00:06:13.001
and it comes from red

00:06:13.002 --> 00:06:15.241
I'm putting I'm pushing a red agenda on my family

00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:16.241
who actually has red hair

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:17.881
so technically she pushed it first

00:06:17.882 --> 00:06:18.741
and she's from

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.080
and she grew up during Zoe Union in Eastern Europe

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.841
so she's actually the one who pushed the red agenda first

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.081
um but my mom

00:06:25.082 --> 00:06:27.801
like now doesn't really wear a lot of color except her hair

00:06:27.802 --> 00:06:28.241
but I'm like okay

00:06:28.242 --> 00:06:28.681
you need these

00:06:28.682 --> 00:06:29.701
so I got these for her

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.320
a little big for her

00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:32.221
but she got them

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.660
and then I got my sister

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.200
oh and those were $27

00:06:38.201 --> 00:06:40.621
I forgot saying the prices these

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.380
tell me tell me

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.380
tell me

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.100
these are Steve Madden shoes for my sister

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.800
40 bucks I'm a phenomenal sister because these are so cute

00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:52.681
got this just this

00:06:52.682 --> 00:06:55.081
like regular rose oil um

00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:56.341
body wash I

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.460
if you didn't know

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.080
love rose I love rose and I love rose scent and Bulgarian

00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:03.321
so rose is a very big deal

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:06.801
and this smells specifically like Bulgarian rose

00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:09.621
which is why I bought it um

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.620
I'm really susceptible to buying basically literally anything with rose

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.200
speak of the devil

00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:20.081
I got um

00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:22.321
these rose um

00:07:22.322 --> 00:07:25.161
makeup wipes cause I know makeup wipes bad

00:07:25.162 --> 00:07:25.841
blah blah blah

00:07:25.842 --> 00:07:28.061
but like you know I needed

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.900
oh did I not buy

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.260
oh I left some things I didn't wanna leave okay

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.060
I have this rose perfume

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.520
I don't have any like

00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:38.841
regular cheap perfume that I could like

00:07:38.842 --> 00:07:40.281
have with me um

00:07:40.282 --> 00:07:41.801
and this smells really good

00:07:41.802 --> 00:07:42.481
it was like 10 bucks

00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:44.021
so it was on clearance

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.580
um I got this so that I can dry brush

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.900
got this cause we were out of hand soap

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.220
I got this cause I was out of awesome

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.580

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.700
so I'm showing you

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.260
this is so I'm so glad I found this

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.460
beautiful scents and it was only $13

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.420
don't mind if I do

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.160
these are definitely the start of the show for me though

00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:21.721
the black honey

00:08:21.722 --> 00:08:24.221
I've been wanting to get a color YSL

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.360

00:08:28.162 --> 00:08:29.441
I'm literally so happy with this haul

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:30.281
amazing phenomenal

00:08:30.282 --> 00:08:32.921
so good and these are the things that I didn't end up actually getting like

00:08:32.922 --> 00:08:37.121
a boob syrup the Garnier Fructis Kylie Skin Lip Matte Morot Supergoop

00:08:37.122 --> 00:08:38.721
I would have gotten this if it was my skin tone

00:08:38.722 --> 00:08:39.981
oh I forgot what it's called

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.520
beauty of josine

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.681
that Korean brand that's like

00:08:42.682 --> 00:08:43.481
all over TikTok

00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:44.281
I do own things from them

00:08:44.282 --> 00:08:45.401
yes and this Sephora

00:08:45.402 --> 00:08:46.481
like two dollar clearance thing

00:08:46.482 --> 00:08:48.063
I don't think any of this was like necessary
