Here's everything I eat in a day

00:01.600 --> 00:05.320
as someone that loves to cook but is also 37 weeks pregnant.

00:05.320 --> 00:08.560
I start off with some herbal tea and then take my prenatals.

00:08.560 --> 00:12.480
I hate the taste of water, so I mixed in some apple juice today.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.120
I was also craving some fresh pressed orange juice,

00:15.120 --> 00:18.380
so I made that and then got started on breakfast.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.600
Crepes are so much better than pancakes.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.240
So today

00:21.240 --> 00:23.000
I made a Robus tea crepe

00:23.000 --> 00:25.840
with some vanilla peach puree that I had in the fridge

00:25.840 --> 00:28.220
and topped it with some strawberries.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.880
These flavors together really hit the spot.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.360
I ended up making a banana date milkshake

00:33.360 --> 00:35.980
before moving on to making my lunch.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.240
You guys know I need to have my midday beverage,

00:38.240 --> 00:42.240
so today we did a blueberry vanilla iced tea for lunch.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.800
I wanted something just light and refreshing and super simple,

00:45.800 --> 00:48.200
so I made a crispy rice salad.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.800
I chopped up a bunch of vegetables I had in the fridge,

00:50.800 --> 00:52.400
which was cucumber, carrot,

00:52.400 --> 00:53.760
some purple radishes,

00:53.760 --> 00:55.200
edamame, green onion,

00:55.200 --> 00:58.640
cilantro, and then I had some leftover rice as well

00:58.640 --> 01:03.480
that I crisped up in my pan before adding my sesame miso dressing

01:03.480 --> 01:04.640
and also some chillies.

01:04.640 --> 01:05.960
I gave that a good toss

01:05.960 --> 01:09.000
and then remember that I also cut up some avocado

01:09.000 --> 01:10.940
so I added that on top.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
Had some errands to run,

01:12.160 --> 01:15.360
so for dinner I made a slow roasted Mediterranean lamb.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.880
Pop that in my Dutch oven with some Warming spices

01:17.880 --> 01:20.080
and let that go for about three hours.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.240
I wanted something sweet,

01:21.240 --> 01:23.360
so I cut up some mango papaya,

01:23.360 --> 01:27.060
and I made a coconut mousse with some coconut sugar on top.

01:27.360 --> 01:28.960
The lamb was close to being done.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.760
I made my flatbread dough

01:30.760 --> 01:33.920
and let that rest for about 30 minutes while I made my date

01:33.920 --> 01:34.940
Grandma Lauda.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.000
My lamb was tender and falling apart.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.040
I shredded it up

01:38.040 --> 01:41.160
and returned it back to the pot to soak up all the juices

01:41.160 --> 01:43.580
while I fried up all of my flatbreads.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.800
This meal, you guys,

01:44.800 --> 01:47.400
was so good. So I put down my flatbread,

01:47.400 --> 01:48.400
some lamb on top.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.200
My date Grandma Lauda added some fresh parsley and some chili.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.740
Also a sprinkle of sumoc. Wow.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.588
And then I was craving some cereal.
