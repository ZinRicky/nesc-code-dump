00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
It literally hit me the other day

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.641
that my daughter is going to be dating boys soon.

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:04.521
No, not too soon.

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:05.681
She's turning 10 this year.

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:06.201
But, like,

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:08.121
we are. We are really just a hop,

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:09.161
skip, and a jump from puberty,

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:11.201
and that's when all of the shit goes down.

00:00:11.202 --> 00:00:13.361
So I realized that I put a lot of, like,

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:15.081
dating and relationship advice out there,

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:17.721
and there's a chance that she will take absolutely none of it,

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:18.601
because that's what kids do.

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:20.161
Kids have to learn the lessons their own way.

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:21.721
And the last person they're gonna take advice from

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.921
when they think they know everything is their parent.

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:24.521
Right.

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:26.881
And I always talk on here about how lucky I am to have met my husband,

00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:27.681
how great our marriage is,

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:28.241
and how much, like,

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:29.481
we love and like each other.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.960
I realized I had to go through a lot of bullshit before I got there,

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:35.561
and she's about to have to go through all the bullshit,

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:37.121
and I really don't want that for her.

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:39.621
It's part of the deal, but I don't want it for her.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.760
Like, I'm gonna have to listen to her cry about some Chad

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:45.381
who wants to play video games more than take her out on a date.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.840
And have to tow the line

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:48.721
where you're not talking trash about the boyfriend

00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:50.321
because the boyfriend might come back.

00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:52.161
I know that the next chapter of parenting is coming,

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:55.041
and I'm not sure I'm quite prepared for that,

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:56.601
because I'm very opinionated.

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:58.261
In some ways, babies are easier
