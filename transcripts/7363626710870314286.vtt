00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.320
This commenter wanted to say,

00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:04.681
my husband doesn't make enough as an electrician because, um,

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.801
I do so much work during the day, in my day,

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:09.281
in the lives. The thing about being a homemaker,

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:12.641
about being a chadwife, is that you are going to be doing work.

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:14.401
That's not the soft life.

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:15.801
It's not avoiding work.

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:17.281
Work is a good thing.

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:18.521
It's been ordained by god.

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:20.801
I think it's a common misconception that if you stay home,

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:24.801
you just get to sit around all day and just do nothing and watch TV.

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:27.521
And that's just not true to some people do that, sure,

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:29.901
but that's not being a good steward of your home.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.400
Being a traditional wife,

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:33.921
a homemaker, is extremely hard work.

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:36.601
It is a lot of long hours into your home,

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:37.521
into your family,

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:38.401
into your children.

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:40.641
But I seriously would not have it any other way.

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:43.641
It is much better than going outside of the home for me

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.221
and working a 9 to five.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.880
Um, I get to decide what goes on in my day.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.841
I get to decide what I wanna do,

00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:53.321
minus the, the regular housekeep of the home.

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:56.121
But yeah, it's still work, and it's important work.

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.081
So if you are in this position,

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.481
just know your work is important.

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:02.821
The Lord sees you even though society might not.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.480
It is extremely important work,

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.281
so keep at it.

00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:06.361
Keep doing it.

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:07.381
You go.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.200
Being a traditional wife,

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.761
a homemaker, is extremely hard work.

00:01:11.762 --> 00:01:14.441
It is a lot of long hours into your home,

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:15.361
into your family,

00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:16.241
into your children.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.501
But I seriously would not have it any other way.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.480
It is much better than going outside of the home for me

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.061
and working a 9 to five.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.680
Um, I get to decide what goes on in my day.

00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:27.681
I get to decide what I wanna do.

00:01:27.682 --> 00:01:31.161
Minus the, the regular housekeep of the home.

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:33.961
But yeah, it's still work and it's important work.

00:01:33.962 --> 00:01:35.921
So if you are in this position,

00:01:35.922 --> 00:01:37.321
just know your work is important.

00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:40.621
The Lord sees you even though society might not.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.320
It is extremely important work,

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:43.121
so keep at it,

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:44.241
keep doing it.

00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:46.221
You go your homemaker,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.080
traditional wife, and you stay home and you might feel like,

00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:49.641
oh, my goodness,

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.081
this work is just so much.

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:52.361
I don't know how I'm gonna do it.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.321
Just know that the Lord sees your efforts,

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:56.321
even though society might not see your efforts.

00:01:56.322 --> 00:01:59.841
The Lord sees you working day in and day out for your family.

00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:01.241
So keep up the good work,

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:01.841
do everything,

00:02:01.842 --> 00:02:05.621
eyes onto the Lord, and be joyful and cheerful in the work of the home.
