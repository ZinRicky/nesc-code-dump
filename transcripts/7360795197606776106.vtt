00:00.080 --> 00:02.120
It's been two weeks since I've given birth,

00:02.121 --> 00:04.441
so let's talk about my birth story.

00:04.442 --> 00:06.201
I believe that two weeks ago,

00:06.202 --> 00:07.861
she fit inside of me.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.340
All started about a week and a half before I actually gave birth.

00:13.640 --> 00:18.540
I would have contractions every night, starting around, like, 6 or 7 p m,

00:18.720 --> 00:22.420
but they would taper off around 11 or 12.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.640
After the first night,

00:23.641 --> 00:25.601
I thought I was going into labor,

00:25.602 --> 00:28.821
but I ended up not going into labor, obviously.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.180
And then I had my midwife appointment the next day.

00:32.559 --> 00:34.880
I was already 3 cm dilated,

00:34.881 --> 00:37.761
so we decided to do a membrane sweep.

00:37.762 --> 00:39.641
With my other two pregnancies,

00:39.642 --> 00:42.481
I went into labor the same day I got the sweep.

00:42.482 --> 00:45.041
So I was convinced that this was gonna happen again

00:45.042 --> 00:46.281
the third time around.

00:46.282 --> 00:48.681
That evening, I got everything prepped.

00:48.682 --> 00:51.261
I was so convinced I was gonna give birth,

00:51.560 --> 00:54.080
I told lucky. We called his parents,

00:54.081 --> 00:54.921
my parents.

00:54.922 --> 00:58.261
We were just all prepping for this baby to arrive that same night.

00:58.360 --> 01:02.360
So then my contraction started like they did the night before,

01:02.361 --> 01:04.361
and they grew an intensity.

01:04.362 --> 01:08.681
They ended up being about a minute long and every five minutes apart.

01:08.682 --> 01:11.421
So I decided to call my midwife.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.800
Tapered off again,

01:12.801 --> 01:14.561
and I got really discouraged

01:14.562 --> 01:17.361
cause I was mentally prepping for her to come that night.

01:17.362 --> 01:19.921
After a few more nights of contractions,

01:19.922 --> 01:21.361
I got so tired

01:21.362 --> 01:25.281
because we ended up going to bed really late every night.

01:25.282 --> 01:28.761
That I decided to do everything I could to get this baby out.

01:28.762 --> 01:30.361
We drank the Castor oil smoothie,

01:30.362 --> 01:31.641
I did dry pumping,

01:31.642 --> 01:33.181
we went on walks,

01:33.240 --> 01:34.600
I got body work done,

01:34.601 --> 01:35.761
went to the chiropractor,

01:35.762 --> 01:37.761
got massages, we did acupressure,

01:37.762 --> 01:41.261
we did everything we could to get this baby out.

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
Nothing worked.

01:42.721 --> 01:46.001
And after about a week and a half of contractions every night,

01:46.002 --> 01:48.241
I just decided to give it a rest

01:48.242 --> 01:51.121
and let her come whenever she wanted to come.

01:51.122 --> 01:52.761
The night I went into labor,

01:52.762 --> 01:56.141
we decided to go on an afternoon walk with the kids.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.440
I just got hit with this realization on that walk

01:59.441 --> 02:03.321
that our life was gonna change so much once this baby came.

02:03.322 --> 02:04.721
And I don't know what it was,

02:04.722 --> 02:07.621
but all of a sudden, I started having contractions,

02:07.680 --> 02:09.080
started becoming more frequent.

02:09.081 --> 02:12.981
So we decided to cut our walk short and just go home.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.800
When we got home,

02:14.801 --> 02:18.081
I started dry pumping and just walking up and down the stairs

02:18.082 --> 02:19.321
in between contractions.

02:19.322 --> 02:21.281
While lucky was putting the to bed,

02:21.282 --> 02:23.321
they started getting more intense again,

02:23.322 --> 02:25.041
but then at 11:30,

02:25.042 --> 02:26.481
they stopped all together.

02:26.482 --> 02:29.081
On 1:30, we finally made it to bed,

02:29.082 --> 02:30.601
and I was so tired.

02:30.602 --> 02:32.961
I immediately tried to go to sleep,

02:32.962 --> 02:34.101
and so did lucky.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.040
About five minutes later,

02:36.041 --> 02:39.981
when got a really strong contraction. After two hours of nothing.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.840
So I didn't really think much of it.

02:41.841 --> 02:44.541
I just decided to sleep through it.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.360
But then the Next one was not even a minute later,

02:47.361 --> 02:50.001
and it was so strong that I could not sleep through it.

02:50.002 --> 02:52.521
And it was so painful. For the next 10 minutes,

02:52.522 --> 02:54.881
I just had contraction after contraction.

02:54.882 --> 02:55.641
And at this point,

02:55.642 --> 02:59.421
lucky was waking up because I was making a lot of different sounds.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.640
My contractions were getting so painful that I could barely move.

03:04.641 --> 03:06.281
And I told lucky to call the midwife

03:06.282 --> 03:08.501
cause I knew I was in active labor.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.680
He wasn't too sure.

03:09.681 --> 03:12.781
He was asking me whether I'm sure whether I really wanna call her,

03:12.840 --> 03:16.100
because we'd called her the other nights when it was false labor.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.360
But I just knew.

03:17.361 --> 03:22.441
So we called her and they said they were about 30 minutes out.

03:22.442 --> 03:26.421
So I was on all fours, leaning against our bed in our bedroom

03:26.480 --> 03:29.160
when I told lucky that I felt the urge to push.

03:29.161 --> 03:32.521
And he immediately knew what that meant.

03:32.522 --> 03:36.481
So I was just on the floor pushing,

03:36.482 --> 03:38.001
and he was behind me

03:38.002 --> 03:40.801
trying to figure out whether this baby was gonna come or not,

03:40.802 --> 03:44.301
because our midwives were still kind of far away.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.320
After a couple pushes,

03:46.321 --> 03:49.521
he told me that he saw the head. Because I asked him what was going on,

03:49.522 --> 03:52.861
and he said that he saw the head and that she was coming right now.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.760
We both knew that our midwives would not be at our house in time.

03:57.761 --> 04:00.521
Lucky stepped up and caught her.

04:00.522 --> 04:04.361
After a couple more Pushes placed her on my chest,

04:04.362 --> 04:07.081
and it was the most magical experience.

04:07.082 --> 04:09.121
After lucky placed her on my chest,

04:09.122 --> 04:10.641
we just kind of sat there

04:10.642 --> 04:13.461
not being able to comprehend what just happened.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.500
And then 15 or 20 minutes later on, Midwest walked through the door.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.760
After our midwifes arrived,

04:19.761 --> 04:21.601
I delivered the placenta.

04:21.602 --> 04:24.081
And then a few hours later,

04:24.082 --> 04:28.861
we cut her cord and did all the stuff we needed to do.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.200
And then three hours later,

04:31.201 --> 04:32.321
our midwives left,

04:32.322 --> 04:34.781
and we were in bed with our new baby.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.642
And that's how little whimsy little was born.
