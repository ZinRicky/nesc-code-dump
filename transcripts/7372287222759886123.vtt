When making dinner tonight,

00:01.201 --> 00:03.441
I realized we were all out of our condiments,

00:03.442 --> 00:05.801
so I decided to do a little restock.

00:05.802 --> 00:07.361
Today we're making some ketchup,

00:07.362 --> 00:09.681
ranch, barbecue sauce, and hot sauce.

00:09.682 --> 00:11.401
So I started with my ketchup,

00:11.402 --> 00:12.681
combining tomato paste,

00:12.682 --> 00:15.201
some honey, vinegar, and water,

00:15.202 --> 00:16.441
simmering that on the stove

00:16.442 --> 00:19.061
before pulling that off and letting it cool,

00:19.080 --> 00:21.000
and I moved on to making some ranch.

00:21.001 --> 00:22.641
I like a lot of herbs in it,

00:22.642 --> 00:24.761
but you can tone that down if you want.

00:24.762 --> 00:26.401
So I chopped up some parsley,

00:26.402 --> 00:30.421
dill, chives and combined that in a bowl with some mayonnaise,

00:30.440 --> 00:32.520
sour cream, some whole milk,

00:32.521 --> 00:33.841
and gave that a good mix

00:33.842 --> 00:38.561
before adding in some lemon juice and cracked black pepper and salt.

00:38.562 --> 00:40.881
I adjusted the seasoning based on what I wanted

00:40.882 --> 00:43.261
before putting it in the fridge to chill.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.120
For my hot sauce,

00:44.121 --> 00:46.001
I chopped up some Fresno chilies,

00:46.002 --> 00:46.921
added some garlic,

00:46.922 --> 00:50.521
black pepper, corn, and vinegar, and diluted that with some water.

00:50.522 --> 00:52.801
Then I simmered that for 20 minutes on the stove

00:52.802 --> 00:54.641
while I made my barbecue sauce.

00:54.642 --> 00:57.861
I combined the ketchup we made earlier with some brown sugar,

00:57.920 --> 01:01.640
vinegar, and some other seasoning, and letting that thicken on the stove,

01:01.641 --> 01:03.641
and once it hit the thickness I wanted,

01:03.642 --> 01:06.381
I transferred that over to a bowl to cool.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.280
I blended up my peppers and strained them.

01:09.281 --> 01:11.821
I was pretty happy with my hot sauce consistency

01:11.920 --> 01:13.600
since I wanted it more runny.

01:13.601 --> 01:15.791
That's how I prep some of My favorite condiments
