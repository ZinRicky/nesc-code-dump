00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.720
alright Veronica says it's outrageous

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:05.201
one student was banned for five years from all campuses

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:06.201
uh that's true

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:10.101
and he just so happens to be a dear friend and comrade of mine

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.920
um and we're gonna have him hop on the mic here on my TikTok

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:17.181
uh this is Bryce and we're gonna let him set the record straight

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.200
hey guys it's Bryce Greene

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.841
uh organizer with the IU Divestment Coalition

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:25.081
and I was one of the people who was arrested yesterday

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:26.761
I am okay I am safe

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:29.401
I am in contact with uh uh

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:32.001
the jail support system that's pretty robust

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.581
so we're all good there

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.920
I would like to correct the record on one thing

00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:38.161
I was not banned from all campuses

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:40.741
I was only banned from IU Bloomington

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.820
this one which is why I'm sitting here on the sidewalk

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.320
uh they banned me

00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:49.341
although there are people who say that it might not hold up

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.620
uh there are people who say that my arrest might not hold up

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.740
uh all that is being ran through the legal channels

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.420
and I hope to be back on campus soon

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.640
now I just wanna say people here are focused on a lot of important issues

00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:09.101
but one of the biggest ones is of course ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¸

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.880
now why is it that the university decided to send a armoured car

00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.641
a wall of police with riot shields

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:19.781
body armour machine guns

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.940
assault rifle shotguns

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.320
choppers in the sky

00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:24.821
drones in the sky

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.100
and a damn sniper on the roof

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.520
now why did they decide to deploy all of this against some students in the park

00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:33.621
with some tents

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.120
the police they came by

00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:39.221
they said disperse your tent and you'll be fine

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.320
if not we have all this lethal force at all of our disposal

00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:45.661
so does that make sense to you

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.520
no it doesn't make sense

00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:51.221
unless you understand that they're doing it because they're so threatened

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.720
by the student activism in support of ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¸

00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:56.201
that they have to bust out this military force

00:01:56.202 --> 00:01:59.121
that they have to demoralize people and traumatize people

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:01.301
in order to maintain their authority

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.740
in G they call this mowing the lawn

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.520
and we get a small

00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:08.201
minuscule taste of it here

00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:10.901
when they met out military strength

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.060
against students who are simply speaking their voice

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.600
and it's just designed to terrorize

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:21.001
humiliate and punish people who speak out for the truth and uh

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:22.601
as long as we're intimidated

00:02:22.602 --> 00:02:25.061
we'll lose but if we understand that we are powerful

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.940
world's ours baby

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.080
thank you so much Bryce

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.999
for your wise words of encouragement and empowerment of free ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¸
