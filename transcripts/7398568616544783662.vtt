00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.760
this country loves promote pharmaceuticals

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:05.840
POV you have nausea and you discover Zofran

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:07.448
did you know the Zofran has a 

00:00:07.449 --> 00:00:08.360
black box warning

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:10.240
and that it causes maternal heart issues

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:12.815
also causes cleft palate when taken 

00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:15.320
in the first trimester of pregnancy

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:17.640
that's when doctors prescribe it the most

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:20.080
it still just blows my mind every time

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:21.880
that these are literal advertisements

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:24.280
that pop up on the for you page of my TikTok

00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:27.118
God forbid we explore the root cause 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.880
of why you're nauseous to begin with

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:31.660
possibly be drinking alcohol or 

00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:33.440
black coffee on an empty stomach

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:34.944
or antibiotics or 

00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:36.113
birth control 

00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:37.200
or pesticides

00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:37.928
herbicides 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:39.120
inflammatory foods

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:39.792
chronic stress 

00:00:39.793 --> 00:00:41.360
couldnâ€™t possibly be any of those things

00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:42.677
that's so stupid so 

00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:44.653
instead just order Zofran
