Everyone loves French toast in my house,

00:01.920 --> 00:04.280
so when my toddlers requested it this morning,

00:04.280 --> 00:06.320
I decided to just make it for them.

00:06.320 --> 00:10.480
I started off by making my brioche bread by adding some yeast flour

00:10.480 --> 00:13.200
milk to my bowl and letting that activate.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.240
Then I added in all of my eggs,

00:15.240 --> 00:20.160
some more flour, and needed that dough until it all came together.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.840
Once it started coming together and forming a dough,

00:22.840 --> 00:24.040
I cut up some butter

00:24.040 --> 00:27.200
and slowly drop that in until it was all incorporated.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.440
Then I covered that and let that rise until it was doubled in size

00:30.440 --> 00:33.360
before portioning it off in three portions.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.780
I rolled those out until they were about 9 inches long,

00:36.840 --> 00:38.120
pinch the top together,

00:38.120 --> 00:39.320
and then braided it up

00:39.320 --> 00:42.620
and tuck the bottom under so it would create a seal.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.800
I placed my dough into my loaf pan

00:44.800 --> 00:47.840
and let that rise until it was about doubled in size.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.640
In the meantime,

00:48.640 --> 00:50.880
I kept my mixed Berry compote

00:50.880 --> 00:53.720
by combining some frozen berries with some maple syrup

00:53.720 --> 00:54.980
and lemon juice

00:55.040 --> 00:57.260
and letting that reduce on the stove.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.280
Once that came together,

00:58.280 --> 01:01.320
I transferred it over and let that cool in my bowl.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.720
I brushed my brioche with some egg wash

01:03.720 --> 01:08.320
and pop that in the oven for about 35 minutes before pulling it out.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.280
I let that cool while I made a quick whipped cream is.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.020
Who doesn't love French toast with whipped cream on top?

01:14.120 --> 01:16.360
At this point, my Bread was cool enough to slice,

01:16.360 --> 01:18.280
so I cut it into slices,

01:18.280 --> 01:20.080
making sure that they weren't too thin

01:20.080 --> 01:23.680
before I combined my egg with some heavy whipping cream,

01:23.680 --> 01:26.320
vanilla and cinnamon to dip my bread in.

01:26.320 --> 01:30.640
I coated both sides and then placed my bread in a buttered up pan.

01:30.640 --> 01:34.600
I fried it until it was golden brown and and it was time to plate.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.120
I put my French toast down,

01:36.120 --> 01:38.920
topped it with the mixed Berry compote, whipped cream,

01:38.920 --> 01:42.080
and I also had some passion fruit lying around and the kids love it,

01:42.080 --> 01:45.349
so I put that on top and they absolutely loved it.
