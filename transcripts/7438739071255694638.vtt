On our eight hour flight last night,

00:01.841 --> 00:04.281
lucky mentioned this amazing half baked cookie

00:04.282 --> 00:06.561
with salted caramel ice cream that he had

00:06.562 --> 00:08.321
and how badly he was craving it.

00:08.322 --> 00:11.801
So this morning I woke up extra early to make him one.

00:11.802 --> 00:14.761
I started by making my salted caramel ice cream

00:14.762 --> 00:16.561
by letting some sugar turn amber

00:16.562 --> 00:19.861
and color, combining that with some heavy cream, milk,

00:19.960 --> 00:23.160
generous pinch of salt, and a little bit more sugar

00:23.161 --> 00:26.921
before letting that warm up and tempering my eggs with it.

00:26.922 --> 00:28.281
Once my eggs were tempered,

00:28.282 --> 00:30.441
I poured them back into the pot,

00:30.442 --> 00:33.081
let that thicken until it coated the back of my spoon,

00:33.082 --> 00:35.521
before straining it through a fine mesh strainer

00:35.522 --> 00:37.781
and setting it in the freezer to chill.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.700
Once it was cold, I turned it in my ice cream maker

00:40.760 --> 00:42.940
and once it hit that soft serve consistency,

00:43.120 --> 00:46.000
I put that in the freezer for about two hours

00:46.001 --> 00:48.221
while I got started on my cookie dough.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.680
Whisk together my sugar and butter,

00:50.681 --> 00:52.641
added my eggs, some egg yolk,

00:52.642 --> 00:55.841
and made sure that was combined before adding my flour,

00:55.842 --> 00:57.841
some cornstarch, and baking soda,

00:57.842 --> 00:59.161
giving that a good mix,

00:59.162 --> 01:02.121
and then roughly chopping my extra dark chocolate

01:02.122 --> 01:04.121
and adding that to the bowl as well

01:04.122 --> 01:06.901
and folding that in until just combined.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.920
I let those bake for just under 10 minutes

01:09.921 --> 01:12.821
since we're going for a very under baked cookie,

01:12.840 --> 01:16.040
and then we were done. I made sure to serve the cookie hot,

01:16.041 --> 01:18.321
put Some of that caramel ice cream on the side,

01:18.322 --> 01:21.561
topped it with some flaky salt and breakfast was done.

01:21.562 --> 01:24.121
Usually doesn't have sweet treats like this,

01:24.122 --> 01:25.567
but he absolutely loved it.
