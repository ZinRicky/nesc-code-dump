00:00.080 --> 00:01.560
I finally found sheets that are long

00:01.560 --> 00:03.940
enough to cover my mattress and my box springs.

00:04.040 --> 00:05.720
These sheets went viral a few months ago,

00:05.720 --> 00:07.720
and I'm so happy I finally got my hands on them.

00:07.720 --> 00:08.760
Our bed is very tall,

00:08.760 --> 00:10.000
and our mattress is really thick,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.560
so I chose the extra deep set of sheets,

00:12.560 --> 00:13.820
and I love them.

00:13.840 --> 00:14.320
Right off the bat,

00:14.320 --> 00:15.880
I noticed how soft they were,

00:15.880 --> 00:17.160
and it wasn't like a hot,

00:17.160 --> 00:18.520
flannelly, soft feeling.

00:18.520 --> 00:19.520
It was more of a smooth,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.040
luxurious, soft feeling,

00:21.040 --> 00:22.020
if that makes sense.

00:22.440 --> 00:22.920
And like I said,

00:22.920 --> 00:24.360
I love how deep these sheets are.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.760
They cover the entire bed.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.400
I didn't have to yank or pool to

00:27.400 --> 00:28.360
try and get them to fit.

00:28.360 --> 00:28.960
And I will say that

00:28.960 --> 00:30.760
my husband is very picky about sheets,

00:30.760 --> 00:31.680
and he loves them,

00:31.680 --> 00:33.400
so they're kind of a big deal around here.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.109
Head over to Amazon and grab yourself a set.
