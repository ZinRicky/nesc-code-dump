00:00.480 --> 00:04.000
I ordered the Swedish candy when I was 36 weeks pregnant

00:04.001 --> 00:06.221
and it just came like a week ago.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.000
I forgot we even ordered it.

00:08.001 --> 00:10.361
So let's taste test it together.

00:10.362 --> 00:12.281
A lot of this is just red candy.

00:12.282 --> 00:13.921
I already know these are gonna be good.

00:13.922 --> 00:15.021
How do you know?

00:15.400 --> 00:16.200
I just know.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.600
Cause they remind you of the German version?

00:18.601 --> 00:19.961
Yeah. Okay,

00:19.962 --> 00:21.741
what are we trying first?

00:21.800 --> 00:23.220
Those. These ones.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.120
Okay, this is what we're gonna try first.

00:25.121 --> 00:27.701
We're gonna rate them. Thank you.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.580
Good, but underwhelming.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.940
Say six out of 10.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.160
Seven. Six.

00:41.161 --> 00:42.241
Six and a half.

00:42.242 --> 00:43.221
Try these next.

00:44.040 --> 00:48.400
These. I've actually had them before when we went to New York.

00:48.401 --> 00:49.861
I got Swedish candy

00:51.080 --> 00:52.780
and I really like them.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.160
Should I be expecting with this?

00:55.161 --> 00:56.301
It's, like, soft.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.700
Mm hmm.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.620
These are 9.2 for me.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.940
4. Not like them.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.140
We have very different taste buds.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.980
We're trying these next.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.840
We have this White Center.

01:18.841 --> 01:20.501
We have a lady in the trap moment.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.520
Still chewing the other candy,

01:23.521 --> 01:24.621
are you? Actually,

01:25.640 --> 01:27.180
I'm really underwhelmed,

01:28.600 --> 01:31.580
but maybe I'm spoiled by the German candy.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.000
I feel like German candy is superior to all the candies.

01:35.001 --> 01:35.841
Maybe cause I'm German,

01:35.842 --> 01:38.221
but that's just my opinion.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.900
Starts out as a 3.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.040
Mmm.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.000
Starts off as a 4 cause you're like, mmm,

01:45.001 --> 01:45.721
different textures.

01:45.722 --> 01:48.301
And then it gets grainy and it turns into 3.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.140
Very interesting.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.320
What do we do next?

01:51.321 --> 01:52.501
The one that I like.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.480
This one. Sorry.

01:53.481 --> 01:54.381
The green ones.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.500
We're Gonna try these green ones next.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.100
Mediocre.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.180
Taste like green apple,

02:11.200 --> 02:13.980
so that's a plus five.

02:15.160 --> 02:18.480
I feel my cavities already.

02:18.481 --> 02:20.561
Right now, these ones are next.

02:20.562 --> 02:23.701
Remind me if this German candy called Freddy Fakka.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.840
They're Lucky's favorite candy,

02:25.841 --> 02:28.481
so let's see whether these compare to them at all,

02:28.482 --> 02:29.681
because they look kind of similar.

02:29.682 --> 02:32.421
I wonder whether the two colors have two different flavors.

02:33.680 --> 02:37.420
Mmm. They are so soft and chewy.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.980
Mmm. An eight

02:42.440 --> 02:46.120
7 one. These I've heard are really sour.

02:46.121 --> 02:46.841
Yeah. Let's try,

02:46.842 --> 02:47.761
let's try, let's try.

02:47.762 --> 02:48.801
I think I need, like,

02:48.802 --> 02:51.181
something sour to break up all the sweetness.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.840
We have a yellow and red side.

02:52.841 --> 02:54.221
Let's try the red first.

02:56.840 --> 03:00.920
To me, they're not that sour.

03:00.921 --> 03:02.441
The yellow side is really good.

03:02.442 --> 03:03.581
I think it's lemon.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.080
This is our last flavor.

03:07.081 --> 03:08.521
She's distracting me.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.701
I'm sorry.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.300
This is our last one.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.100
This is very similar to the other red one.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.020
I mean,

03:19.840 --> 03:21.100
I'll be honest,

03:21.400 --> 03:22.900
I'm very underwhelmed.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.900
Me, too. These stole the show.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.900
These ones were my favorite.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.680
But what's your overall rating for this candy?

03:32.681 --> 03:34.221
Like, would you repurchase?

03:34.760 --> 03:36.760
I wouldn't. Definitely would not repurchase.

03:36.761 --> 03:38.501
Those are a little taste test.
