00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.280
I've been through so much,

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:02.441
I've seen so much.

00:00:02.442 --> 00:00:04.861
I've been attacked so many times.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.520
Death threats.

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:07.681
I've been sexualized,

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:09.201
I've been threatened.

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:12.601
I've been so many things, and I'm still strong every single time.

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:13.641
Doctor Martin here.

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:16.321
Our society's dehumanization and adultification of black girls

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:18.321
has profound impacts on their mental health.

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:19.081
From a young age,

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:21.541
they're unfairly burdened with expectations,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.880
stripping away their innocence

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:24.921
and exposing them to relentless scrutiny.

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:27.161
This not only erodes their mental resilience,

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:28.201
leading to anxiety,

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:29.881
depression, and diminished self worth,

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:32.481
but it also affects their performance in all areas of life,

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:33.761
including sports.

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:35.041
In the high pressure world of sports,

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:38.321
these young athletes face additional challenges from racism

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:39.561
and gender biases.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.420
why it's so important to have licensed mental health professionals

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.320
embedded in sports.

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:47.001
We are dedicated to helping them develop positive coping strategies,

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:48.001
enhance their self esteem,

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.821
and ensure that they can focus on their passion for the game,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.120
free from societal prejudices and mental fatigue.

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.841
We also educate coaches,

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:58.961
teams, and sports organizations on the importance of

00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:01.601
inclusive environments that combat adultification,

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:04.881
dehumanization, and stripping these individuals of their humanity.

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:07.881
It's crucial to foster a sports culture that values mental well being

00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:09.501
as much as physical prowess.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.760
I call in everyone involved in sports to embrace sports psychology

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:13.721
for a healthier,

00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:15.601
more equitable athletic community

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:18.661
so that players can play at their highest level

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.400
while also being champions of their mental well being.
