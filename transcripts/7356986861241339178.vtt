00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.060
I just got to the Wits Creator Summit here in Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.000
I just took off all my makeup,

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:08.081
done comfy outfit,

00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:09.301
hung out for a little bit.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.320
Now I'm gonna get ready to go meet my girls, Andrea and Juju,

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:14.061
for dinner. So let's get ready.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.520
Okay.

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:20.001
That was super anticlimactic, because I already did most of my makeup,

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:20.761
and I'm almost dressed,

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:22.581
but I can't quite get myself in.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.280
There we go. Okay.

00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:25.221
But we can do hair.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.600
So I'm actually here in Salt Lake for what's

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.561
called the women in Travel Summit.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:32.001
It is a travel influencer conference.

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:32.961
And I know what you're gonna say.

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:34.041
You're gonna say, Lisa,

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:35.721
you're not actually a travel influencer.

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:36.601
And to that, I say,

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:38.481
says who? Technically,

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:39.881
I do a lot of lifestyle stuff,

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:41.401
and since we've been homeschooling,

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:43.761
I really am doing a lot more travel content

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:46.521
just because it kind of lines up with what we're doing in our life.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:49.561
So I decided to come here because a worst case scenario,

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:51.801
I get a couple nights away from the kids and hotel room

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.261
in a bed by myself,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.380
um, with two of my girlfriends from home.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.680
Or best case scenario,

00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:02.761
make some connections and get some tips and have a lot of fun,

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.813
and it gets to do more travel content for y'all.
