00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.920
come check out goodwill with me today

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:04.601
where I find something I've been looking for for the longest time

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:06.201
I go to goodwill three times a week

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:10.121
and I'm always on the look for a coach vintage purse

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:12.081
and I finally found the first one today

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:13.321
I was super excited

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:15.041
and at first I wasn't sure if it was a coach

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:16.081
and then it is

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.681
I opened it up and there's no liner

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:18.721
which is perfect

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:20.461
I knew I could restore this bag

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.300
and then the disappointment came because there is a massive hole

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.860
what in the world happened to this bag

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.920
they still had this bag for us at 9 99

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:31.641
and with the whole

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:32.321
it's kinda trash

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:34.175
I don't think I can fix it so next time
