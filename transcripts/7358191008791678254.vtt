00:00.080 --> 00:02.200
I gave birth a little under a week ago

00:02.201 --> 00:05.941
and my parents flew all the way out from Germany to help us,

00:06.000 --> 00:07.520
and it truly takes a village,

00:07.521 --> 00:11.041
especially if you have two toddlers that need to be entertained

00:11.042 --> 00:11.841
as well.

00:11.842 --> 00:15.841
Baby usually sleeps three hour stretches, so that's been really nice.

00:15.842 --> 00:19.361
Lucky insists I wake him up every time she needs a diaper change

00:19.362 --> 00:20.841
or needs to be reswaddled.

00:20.842 --> 00:22.021
So I do that

00:22.040 --> 00:24.840
and then our kids storm into the room and need to hold her

00:24.841 --> 00:26.041
while they go downstairs

00:26.042 --> 00:28.161
and have some breakfast with their grandparents.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.001
I nurse her for the second time

00:30.002 --> 00:34.021
and then make my way downstairs to make myself a hot cup of tea.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.520
Postpartum experience has been so different than my other two.

00:37.521 --> 00:39.521
My body is recovering a lot quicker,

00:39.522 --> 00:41.401
but my emotions are all over the place,

00:41.402 --> 00:43.701
so I'm just trying to give myself some Grace.

00:43.760 --> 00:47.200
Slow down. Also haven't been in the kitchen in almost a week,

00:47.201 --> 00:50.801
so I was very excited to make myself some breakfast this morning.

00:50.802 --> 00:52.121
Wanted to keep it really simple,

00:52.122 --> 00:55.321
so I made an avocado toast and a tomato toast,

00:55.322 --> 00:58.481
sprinkled that with some flaky salt and olive oil.

00:58.482 --> 01:01.201
Obviously had to also top it with some pickled onions.

01:01.202 --> 01:03.721
There's something about simple breakfast that I like.

01:03.722 --> 01:06.881
Lucky also made himself some steak and eggs with some PICO,

01:06.882 --> 01:10.341
and then he went upstairs to make our bed while I got ready.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.480
Step I never skip.

01:11.481 --> 01:12.921
I get Ready every single morning,

01:12.922 --> 01:16.481
even if it's just putting on some moisturizer to get back into bed.

01:16.482 --> 01:17.801
Today was one of those days

01:17.802 --> 01:20.121
where I felt good enough to put on some makeup.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.161
So I did that

01:21.162 --> 01:24.981
before going downstairs and helping lucky do the kids'hair.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.320
He's usually the one doing it,

01:26.321 --> 01:28.321
but today he wanted to give them a trim

01:28.322 --> 01:30.521
and wanted to make sure that I was okay with it.

01:30.522 --> 01:31.601
That's what he did.

01:31.602 --> 01:33.981
And it ended up turning out so well.

01:34.000 --> 01:34.680
Let me tell you,

01:34.681 --> 01:37.521
getting three kids out the house is an Olympic sport.

01:37.522 --> 01:39.841
So it took us a while to get out the house.

01:39.842 --> 01:40.561
But when we did,

01:40.562 --> 01:42.521
we went on a little walk with my parents.

01:42.522 --> 01:45.921
Not too long, because at this point, I was getting so tired.

01:45.922 --> 01:47.881
We stopped by in and out for an early lunch

01:47.882 --> 01:49.481
and had to get some milkshakes.

01:49.482 --> 01:52.081
Combination of chocolate and vanilla is so good.

01:52.082 --> 01:53.245
And then I got back into bed.
