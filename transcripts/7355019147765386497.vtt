00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.537
I just spent the last five days trying 

00:00:01.538 --> 00:00:02.921
to give this room the biggest glow up

00:00:02.922 --> 00:00:04.681
this is how it looked before and no

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.081
I'm not responsible for that okay

00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:07.481
this is just how it looked when we bought it

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.201
not to frighten you if you've been following for a while

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:10.961
but we moved in 11 months ago

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:12.281
I know what the actual fk right

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:13.401
and for the last 11 months

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:15.452
my first born has been calling this his bedroom 

00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:16.521
and he's about to turn 12

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:18.268
so for his birthday I wanted to surprise him 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.201
with a brand new bedroom

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:20.761
we stripped everything out plastered

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:22.761
sanded and primed every surface in the bedroom

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:23.961
my husband put up some panelling

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:26.721
and then we painted until we could no longer feel our arms

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:28.361
then I cleaned the windows and shampooed 

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.881
the carpets and that was day four done

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:32.321
I let the carpet dry overnight and then we came back on day five

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:33.601
which was the funnest day of all

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:35.721
because today we get to make it actually a bedroom

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:36.721
my son didn't ask for much

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:37.921
but he did ask for a bigger bed

00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:39.641
and here's me pretending to put up a shelf

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:41.121
which I actually had nothing to do with

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:43.223
I put a 15 dollar Minecraft poster in a cheap 

00:00:43.224 --> 00:00:44.641
frame and now it looks like art

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:46.241
hung some sheers and these windows will 

00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:47.361
also have some roller blinds

00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:48.121
but they're not ready yet

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:49.281
Re-used these guitar holders

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:50.612
which we had from our old house 

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:52.401
and I found this light shade for 13 dollars

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:54.761
and I reckon it looks a damn sight better than what it was

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:56.401
my son's use these drawers all of his life

00:00:56.402 --> 00:00:58.441
which my dad painted for me when I was a baby

00:00:58.442 --> 00:01:00.092
and we installed some second hand lights 

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.221
which we got from my in laws

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.560
and after an extremely busy five days this is how it turned out

00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:07.401
I love that the majority of the things in this room were things we already had

00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:10.361
I painted my 20 year old side table and that lamp in part one

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.281
and the wall panelling and the paint we had left over from another project

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:16.521
and I reused his favourite things and sentimental items for styling

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:18.001
The teenage years can be fkn brutal

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.321
so I wanted to create a calming sanctuary for him

00:01:20.322 --> 00:01:21.921
that reflects who he is as a person

00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:24.001
but also one that he can put his own stamp on

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:25.921
and that will grow with him through the next chapter

00:01:25.922 --> 00:01:27.401
and hopefully if he likes it

00:01:27.402 --> 00:01:29.021
he might even keep it clean
