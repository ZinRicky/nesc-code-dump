00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.380
I don't care that she's thin

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.760
this film to me is fat representation

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:05.360
so this is Penelope, long story short

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:08.000
family curse makes her have a pig's nose and ears

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.080
and this is like very rich blue blood family

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:11.760
and so obviously like they're ashamed of her

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.920
so her parents basically pretend she died and have kept her like

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.200
locked up for you know

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.600
25 years because they don't want her to be seen by the public

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:20.160
and they've been trying since she was 18 to get rid of the curse because she

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.480
to be accepted by one of her own

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.440
so they're trying to get her to get married to another

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:24.560
like Blue Blood Man

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:25.720
and then when that happens in

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:28.220
the nose will disappear and she'll be “pretty” obviously

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.160
but it's like I I wish I could explain it

00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:31.040
but you just need to watch it

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:32.800
it's fantastical it's romantic

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.480
it's coming of age and honestly

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:36.360
it's like I think kind of ahead of this time

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:39.480
there's like such a good self love message behind this

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:40.840
and like the cast is just stacked

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.640
Christina Richie Wednesday Addams right

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:46.000
Reese Witherspoon her friend Catherine O'hara is her mom

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.600
and her love interest is James McCoy

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:48.640
Peter Dinklage is also in it

00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:49.920
he's like this reporter it's

00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:51.600
it's just it's such a good film

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.480
and like James McCoy as love interest like

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:55.820
cause also like you watch him grow it just

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.000
and her like learning to love herself and like

00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.640
find love despite this like

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:01.760
big thing that she thought would make people

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.720
you know afraid of her and not wanna be around her

00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:04.720
you know she thought she like

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.000
was unlovable and like

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.920
she literally wasn't living as a person because of this thing

00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:12.520
I don't know there's very little positive fat representation

00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:14.000
so when I watch this film I

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.840
I see myself represented in her

00:01:16.841 --> 00:01:18.440
obviously I know that she's not fat

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:18.800
but I don't know

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:22.160
there's just some films and some characters that aren't fat but feel fat

00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:24.240
coded to me and I'm gonna relate

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:25.040
but like watch this clip

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:26.280
so she goes off on her own and like

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:28.320
goes missing so her parents call the police

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:28.960
police are like okay

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:31.160
like can we have a picture of her so we can know who we're looking

00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:32.560
and didn't even have a picture of her

00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:34.380
and this is the clip the detailed description

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.100
brown hair uh huh

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.780
brown hair uh huh

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.500
brown eyes uh huh

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.420
a uniquely pleasant personality

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.980
think pig

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.200
so she's a fat girl not exactly 

00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:53.000
you cannot tell me that that's not fat coated

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.040
anyways I love her and this film genuinely

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:56.240
I cannot recommend it enough

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.822
please go watch it and enjoy
