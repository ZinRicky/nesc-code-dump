00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.880
What I eat in a day as a mom who eats an ancestral diet

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:04.401
and as someone who avoids seed oils,

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:05.721
artificial sugars, dyes,

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:07.001
and preservatives at all costs.

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.561
I start my morning off with a coffee

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:10.161
using organic beans to caffeinate

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:12.461
with the chemical free Swiss water process

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.800
and then have a small bowl of probiotic cottage cheese

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:16.201
with passion fruit from my vine.

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:19.601
At 8:00am I get to making sourdough pizza using my sourdough,

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.361
freshly milled whole grain flour,

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:22.601
salt and water. While that rests,

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:25.601
I make myself two fried eggs for my pasture raised chickens out back.

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:27.241
My chickens get an organic corn free,

00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:28.681
soy free grain mix. At two PM

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.401
I prepare the batter for a loaf of chocolate chip pumpkin bread

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:34.081
using 24 hour fermented buckwheat and iron corn flour.

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:35.401
While this bakes for one hour,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:36.321
I make some pate

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:38.881
using pasture raised chicken livers from a nearby farm

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:39.921
along with garlic, butter,

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:42.361
Rosemary for my bush, raw cream and salt.

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:44.001
This pate is absolutely delicious

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.761
and incredibly nutritious for everybody

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:48.921
from babies to adult. I save and reuse all my glass jars and free

00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:50.881
small servings of pate for a later day.

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.401
The pumpkin bread comes out of the oven

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:54.961
just as I get back in the house from picking the kids up from school,

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:56.961
and shortly thereafter I shape the pizzas

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:59.001
allowing them to do their final rise before dinner.

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.121
At five thirty PM I prepare the pizzas by carefully placing the dough

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:03.241
Onto a hot pizza stove

00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:06.041
pairing with pasture raised raw cheese and all beef pepperonis,

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:08.841
then baking for 7 minutes on the outside grill until sizzling.

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:11.441
Salad is quick and simple with an olive oil and vinegar dressing.

00:01:11.442 --> 00:01:13.441
I transferred the hot pizza to a wooden board

00:01:13.442 --> 00:01:14.961
and slice it using a pizza cutter.

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:16.601
This is the best pizza in the world,

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:17.841
hands down. For dessert

00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:20.701
we enjoyed a piece of chocolate chip pumpkin bread with butter.
