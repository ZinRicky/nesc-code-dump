00:00.080 --> 00:02.960
Anytime I post about being a stay at home mom and how much I enjoy it,

00:02.961 --> 00:04.201
I get comments like this,

00:04.202 --> 00:05.321
usually along the lines of,

00:05.322 --> 00:06.521
your husband's cheating on you.

00:06.522 --> 00:08.521
Probably he's gonna leave you someday.

00:08.522 --> 00:10.481
You know, just really genuine,

00:10.482 --> 00:11.721
kind comments like that.

00:11.722 --> 00:14.041
And I know a lot of people probably have, like,

00:14.042 --> 00:18.441
past trauma and reasons for not wanting to trust anyone.

00:18.442 --> 00:22.281
To project your bad experiences with marriage or with men

00:22.282 --> 00:23.841
onto other people's marriages

00:23.842 --> 00:25.241
is just ridiculous,

00:25.242 --> 00:26.241
and it's not fair.

00:26.242 --> 00:27.801
And I refuse to,

00:27.802 --> 00:29.041
you know, take it seriously.

00:29.042 --> 00:30.241
And I always stop and think, like,

00:30.242 --> 00:32.681
what do these people expect me to do?

00:32.682 --> 00:34.241
I think they expect me to look at my life.

00:34.242 --> 00:36.081
My husband, I have been married almost 10 years.

00:36.082 --> 00:37.201
We got a great thing going.

00:37.202 --> 00:38.521
I trust him, I love him.

00:38.522 --> 00:40.281
I have every reason to do so.

00:40.282 --> 00:41.401
Our kids are thriving,

00:41.402 --> 00:41.881
they're happy,

00:41.882 --> 00:42.481
they're healthy,

00:42.482 --> 00:46.801
and I get to personally oversee the foundation that is their childhood.

00:46.802 --> 00:48.501
Just look at all of that and go.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.220
Now, you know what, honey?

00:50.240 --> 00:51.200
Change of plans.

00:51.201 --> 00:55.841
We are actually going to start spending about $20,000 per child

00:55.842 --> 00:59.401
per year to pay another woman to do what I do,

00:59.402 --> 01:00.761
to spend time watching our kids.

01:00.762 --> 01:03.081
I'm going to forgo those precious years with them

01:03.082 --> 01:05.001
and I'm gonna go get a 9 to 5 office job.

01:05.002 --> 01:07.841
I'm going to set aside all of the money that I make for myself

01:07.842 --> 01:11.041
simply because some Women on TikTok who don't know you,

01:11.042 --> 01:11.801
don't know me.

01:11.802 --> 01:13.801
Uh, they say that you're a bad guy.

01:13.802 --> 01:15.081
Like, a really bad guy.

01:15.082 --> 01:17.041
Since there are other guys out there who are bad

01:17.042 --> 01:18.321
and who have left their families,

01:18.322 --> 01:20.761
I'm just going to assume that you're going to do that.

01:20.762 --> 01:22.761
That's the kind of relationship that we're gonna have.

01:22.762 --> 01:23.561
It's ridiculous.

01:23.562 --> 01:24.441
I'm not doing that.

01:24.442 --> 01:27.881
I think a lot of people think so little of stay at home moms,

01:27.882 --> 01:29.041
of Tribe Wives,

01:29.042 --> 01:30.041
of homemakers,

01:30.042 --> 01:30.721
of Housewives,

01:30.722 --> 01:31.761
whatever you wanna call them,

01:31.762 --> 01:33.841
and they genuinely think that we're stupid.

01:33.842 --> 01:35.761
We know that bad things can happen,

01:35.762 --> 01:38.401
but we also know that the best things in life,

01:38.402 --> 01:40.341
basically anything worth doing in life,

01:40.440 --> 01:41.400
requires risk.

01:41.401 --> 01:44.161
Turns out that no matter how much of a boss babe you are,

01:44.162 --> 01:46.041
no matter how independent you think you are,

01:46.042 --> 01:47.601
no matter how many prenups you sign,

01:47.602 --> 01:49.161
there is risk in marriage.

01:49.162 --> 01:51.861
There is risk in having any kind of deep,

01:51.880 --> 01:53.840
meaningful connection with another human being,

01:53.841 --> 01:54.961
whether it is a partner,

01:54.962 --> 01:56.321
a spouse, a child,

01:56.322 --> 01:58.241
a friend, a family member.

01:58.242 --> 02:01.561
There is no safe way to love another person,

02:01.562 --> 02:02.521
because at any point,

02:02.522 --> 02:05.121
any of those people could just decide they're done with you.

02:05.122 --> 02:06.721
So for us stay at home moms,

02:06.722 --> 02:07.401
for us, you know,

02:07.402 --> 02:08.481
more traditional women,

02:08.482 --> 02:10.841
we acknowledge that there is risk in our lifestyle,

02:10.842 --> 02:11.481
of course,

02:11.482 --> 02:14.921
but we feel that being able to be with our small children in the few

02:14.922 --> 02:16.841
short Years they have of being small

02:16.842 --> 02:19.581
and personally being the ones who lay the foundation

02:19.920 --> 02:21.080
that is their childhood,

02:21.081 --> 02:24.481
is worth whatever kind of scenario you think is gonna happen, right?

02:24.482 --> 02:25.921
It's worth that risk for us.

02:25.922 --> 02:28.001
I think some people spend their entire lives

02:28.002 --> 02:29.881
just waiting for bad things to happen

02:29.882 --> 02:33.121
and just being suspicious of every single person around them.

02:33.122 --> 02:34.961
And that's fine, if that's what you wanna do,

02:34.962 --> 02:36.121
but life is short,

02:36.122 --> 02:38.361
and I do not think that is any way to live.

02:38.362 --> 02:39.841
I refuse to live that way.

02:39.842 --> 02:41.881
I refuse to think that all men are bad,

02:41.882 --> 02:42.841
because some of them are.

02:42.842 --> 02:46.201
I'm raising two sons, and I think that is such a toxic,

02:46.202 --> 02:48.841
gross, bad mentality to have.

02:48.842 --> 02:50.121
No, thank you. And unfortunately,

02:50.122 --> 02:52.161
I think a lot of people who leave these types of comments

02:52.162 --> 02:53.321
would love to see me fail.

02:53.322 --> 02:55.681
They would love to see my husband leave me

02:55.682 --> 02:58.041
and for me and my kids to be on the streets. Right?

02:58.042 --> 02:59.721
They. That would make them so happy,

02:59.722 --> 03:01.161
because then they could look at me and say,

03:01.162 --> 03:01.921
I told you so.

03:01.922 --> 03:03.601
You shouldn't have been so proud to be a mom.

03:03.602 --> 03:05.281
You shouldn't have been so proud to stay at home with your kids.

03:05.282 --> 03:07.041
You should have lived more like me.

03:07.042 --> 03:07.961
And so to those people,

03:07.962 --> 03:08.721
I say, you know,

03:08.722 --> 03:09.561
keep following along,

03:09.562 --> 03:12.161
keep watching my videos and spending time on my content.

03:12.162 --> 03:14.281
Maybe someday your fantasy will come true.

03:14.282 --> 03:15.681
But until then,

03:15.682 --> 03:17.761
I'm Going to be living in the here and the now.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.041
I have today. I'm going to be spending it with my kids.

03:20.042 --> 03:22.481
I'm gonna be taking care of my husband,

03:22.482 --> 03:24.081
I'm going to be at home with them,

03:24.082 --> 03:25.456
and that's that.
