00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.420
Some citric acid.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.880
This is full fat milk.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.240
I have skim cream off the top,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.140
but it's still full fat milk. It's not.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.080
Why you put it back,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.840
please. It's not.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.560
It's for looking at,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.580
not for reading.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.220
Now we hit about 100 degrees and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.580
to the pot.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.760
Can already see the milk sign to change

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.500
lid on for 10 minutes.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.540
And a tiny gloves for. This is really hot. But

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.760
a little warm.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.100
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.540
But it's stretching
