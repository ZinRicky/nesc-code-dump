00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.608
is it aesthetic?

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:02.971
but is it authentic?

00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:03.440
 also no

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:04.600
but is it fkn delicious

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.574
comfort food with seven hidden vegetables 

00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:07.280
that serves six

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:08.969
For less than $5 each?

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.680
yes, yes it is

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.400
and at risk of really pissing off the Italian community

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.160
this is how I make my lasagna

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.320
nobody ever actually taught me how to make lasagna

00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:17.520
so this could be all wrong

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:20.640
this is just one of those recipes that I figured out when I first became a mum

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:24.080
in a pan pop onion and garlic saute until soft and translucent

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:25.400
into that I'm adding mushroom

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:26.920
courgette carrot and capsicum

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:29.007
then I add a kilo of my beef mince and 

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:30.720
season generously with kelp salt

00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:32.280
mixed herbs smoked paprika

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.795
cumin and pepper then I add some of this yeast spread 

00:00:34.796 --> 00:00:35.960
which is totally optional

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:37.837
but I do find it gives the heartier flavour 

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:39.160
I also add Worcestershire sauce

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:41.080
balsamic vinegar and a can of tomatoes

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:44.640
you wanna let that simmer and reduce for as long as you possibly can basically

00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:46.200
or for as long as you've got time for

00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:49.320
then I get started on my cheese sauce so I begin with a roux made of butter

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:52.480
flour and milk I'm actually using oat milk cause we didn't have any cow's milk

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:54.960
which is why the milk's not super white but either way

00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:56.080
it still tastes the same to me

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:57.160
and in goes the cheese

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.400
and when you've got your cheese sauce to the right consistency

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:01.080
it's time to put your lasagna together

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:02.400
using fresh lasagna sheets

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:03.800
so these are already oven ready

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:05.320
I just start layering my mince

00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:07.000
my cheese sauce and my pasta

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:10.200
and I do this as many times as I can with the ingredients that I have

00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.480
and when I'm on to my final layer

00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:13.980
I top it all with some grated mozzarella cheese

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.400
cover with tin foil so we don't burn that top layer of cheese

00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:18.360
and pop it in the oven when it's about halfway done

00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:21.360
I do take that tin foil off so the top can become nice and golden

00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:24.000
let it stand for a couple of minutes before slicing and serve it

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.480
this is such an easy family friendly dish and a guaranteed crowd pleaser

00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:29.534
as always you can find the recipe down below
