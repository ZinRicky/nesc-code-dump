00:00.240 --> 00:02.720
Everyone has their own idea of self care

00:02.720 --> 00:03.920
for being honest.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.560
Mine is just being at home in my kitchen

00:06.560 --> 00:07.560
making something yummy.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.320
It's the absolute coziest time of the year.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.280
I love finding reasons to stay home

00:11.280 --> 00:12.520
and snuggle my babies.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.200
I'm partnering with Albertsons to

00:14.200 --> 00:15.720
get grocery delivery today

00:15.720 --> 00:18.240
so we can have a cozy winter dinner at home together

00:18.240 --> 00:18.920
tonight! Tonight

00:18.920 --> 00:21.240
I'm actually making a recipe I got from my grandmother

00:21.240 --> 00:22.200
for chicken pot pie.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.580
I use fresh veggies in it instead of frozen,

00:24.640 --> 00:26.680
and I also use fresh rotisserie chicken.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.460
It's the ultimate comfort food.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.040
Albertsons makes it so easy

00:33.040 --> 00:35.000
for me to make something for my family that is simple,

00:35.000 --> 00:36.340
cozy, and comforting

00:36.400 --> 00:38.460
all without even having to leave my house.
