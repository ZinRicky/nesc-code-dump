00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.000
Have you ever heard

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.360
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.560
was convincing the world he didn't exist?

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.540
That is exactly how an abusive relationship works.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.040
The man is not gonna come up to you and be like,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.360
hey, girl, I'm gonna fuck your shit up,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.480
and not in a good way.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.140
I'm gonna fuck you up. No,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.420
they're gonna come up to you and be like, hey, girl,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.760
you don't even gotta worry about that.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.720
I'll take care of it.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.480
Don't worry about that.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.480
I'll take care of it.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.720
I got you, girl.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.860
You don't need to work.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.360
I'll take care of that.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.280
I'll take care of that.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.800
They're gonna take care of so much

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.120
that what you don't realize is

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.120
you're giving away all of your power,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.200
all of your autonomy,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.740
all of your independence.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.260
And then one day,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.320
when maybe you wanna do something different,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.580
you wanna just break out of the norm.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.120
Who's in control at that point?

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.460
Who is the one holding all of the power?

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.120
Someone who truly loves you,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.040
wants more out of you.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.000
They want to inspire the greatness that they see.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.780
They want to cultivate

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.160
the things that they know live inside you.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.400
They don't want to have you

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400
just this complacent doll sitting there.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.640
You're worth more than that.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.660
You have more to offer the world than that.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.360
And anybody who doesn't want to see that

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.600
doesn't have your best interest at heart.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.400
So just remember the greatest trick.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.760
The Devil ever pulled

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.380
was convincing the world he didn't exist.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.040
The greatest trick this man is ever gonna do

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.540
is convince you that you don't have to work.
