00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.360
I think the internet has genuinely

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:03.800
corrode people's ability to communicate with others

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:07.360
it has made everyone view others as so disposable

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:09.160
that they are not worth a conversation

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:13.060
like watching creators come on to the internet and like

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.360
cause drama and strife when you could just pick up a phone

00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:18.400
send a little text

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:22.040
every time I see a creator bring interpersonal beef to the internet

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:24.960
that could have been handled personally because like

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:26.280
you were connected to this person

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:27.360
you were friends something

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.400
it's just like

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:31.160
watching it is really embarrassing and just like

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:32.440
it's like sad because like

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:35.600
you can't even speak to this person like a human being

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:39.040
you needed the public so badly to be involved into this

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:41.280
in this issue when you could have resolved it

00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:43.320
like what happened to conflict resolution

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.920
like what happened to like

00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:47.080
being able talk to people in your life

00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:48.200
like communicate like normal

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:51.240
like not everything needs to be as dramatic as we make it on the internet

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:51.920
and I just think that like

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:54.680
everyone had become so obsessed with clicks and views

00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:58.080
like they forgotten that the people in our screens are actual human beings

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:00.160
like they are people as well

00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:00.640
it's just like

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:02.280
it's just so disappointing to watch

00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.320
we need to bring back conflict resolution skill

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:06.560
we need to bring back interpersonal communication

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:07.280
like we just

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:09.080
we need to bring back being able to like

00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:10.840
talk to people talk to your community

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:12.140
talk to your neighbours like

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.120
like the person that you're speaking to in your phone

00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:16.680
is the same as the person next door

00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:18.400
like not every fight also has to be like

00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:19.320
the end of a relationship

00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:21.860
I think it'd be really beneficial for people to be able to like

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.040
resolve a conflict within a relationship and then continue that relationship

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:27.000
you know what I mean obviously

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:28.880
like for people online maybe it's different

00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:29.360
but like

00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:31.080
in general I think we

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:31.560
as people

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:35.680
have kind of lapsed on our ability to resolve conflict within one another

00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:36.480
but like

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.000
learn to pick up a phone like

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.160
honestly 99% of the time

00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:41.560
when there's an issue that I have

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:43.800
I would rather call someone

00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:44.640
like call a creator

00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:46.240
call a friend call whoever

00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:47.700
or speak to the face to face

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.880
and it's so much easier to handle the situation than texting

00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:52.840
than social media then like

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:53.600
whatever it just like

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:56.222
I just really need people to learn how to communicate that's all
