00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
I have the most absolutely exciting news to share

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.721
that I wanna share with all of my TikTok friends

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.441
because these opportunities would not have come to me

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:15.681
if it weren't for you. I am writing a motherfucking book.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.641
Like, a real book.

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:18.721
Not like, I'm not just, like,

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:20.361
on my own, self publishing something like

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:24.441
there I have a team and it's gonna be published with, like,

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:28.161
a real publisher, and we're working on it,

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:31.261
and it is outrageously exciting.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.840
And I have, like, other, like,

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:36.521
little projects that I'm working on

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:41.081
and fucking flying to Los Angeles tomorrow to film something.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.681
So I'm, like,

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:45.361
outrageously thankful for the support.

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:48.941
I know there's plenty of hate and that could just.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.720
I'm just choosing to ignore all that

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:55.081
because the opportunities that are coming my way are just, like,

00:00:55.082 --> 00:01:00.281
literal dreams. And I'm so thankful for all of my friends here

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:04.121
that have loved and supported me through my little healing process

00:01:04.122 --> 00:01:06.581
to get from Chad wife to, like,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.560
single mom standing on my own.

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:10.621
Fucking add author to the list.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.040
So I just wanted to share that super exciting news

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.481
with my little TikTok family.

00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:19.741
I love you guys so fucking much.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.940
And if you're in a fucking marriage that you're not happy with,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.980
I guarantee you're not crazy,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.340
and I guarantee you'd be a lot happier if you laughed.
