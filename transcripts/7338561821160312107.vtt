00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.680
hi guys I'm Victoria lit

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:05.261
and I suffer from TWD

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.000
TWD is well the medical terms for it is traditional wife disease

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.841
it's been dormant from a young age

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:18.361
and the prognosis for this probably originated from my traditional Latina mother

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:20.841
so basically what TWD is

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:22.241
when you're married or with

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:23.161
you're with a man

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:24.121
you cook, clean,

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:24.881
do his laundry,

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:26.081
do everything for him.

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:28.621
basically you just wanna do anything to please him.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.160
a lot of women actually suffer from this disease,

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:34.781
and it goes undiagnosed because they haven't found a good man yet.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.260
so they don't even realize they have it

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.840
now this disease scares most women

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.341
um they're terrified of contracting it

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.400
it's understandable

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:45.561
because they think that it's enslavement

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:47.981
when actually it's enrichment in your life

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.600
it's actually a gift

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:55.541
so I just wanted to kind of be a spokesperson for someone who suffers with TWD

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.760
and just you know

00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:58.601
tell you that you're not alone in this

00:00:58.602 --> 00:00:59.861
we're in this together

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.100
first example of how I knew I had trad wife disease

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.640
was that when I first met him

00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:07.001
I had these butterflies in my stomach

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:10.701
and I automatically just wanted to do anything to please him.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.040
it was a huge tell, of how I knew I had this disease

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.401
I started cooking for him,

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:17.241
cleaning for him,

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:18.281
doing all his laundry,

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:21.221
doing anything to make him happy!

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.720
which was kind of crazy,

00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:25.461
because I didn't think I'd ever do this for a man.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.420
but that was a huge tell

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.480
another example is,

00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:31.521
if he mentioned something in passing that he liked once

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:34.481
I would automatically store that in my memory

00:01:34.482 --> 00:01:38.921
I would either make whatever he said he liked or prepare anything

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:41.301
I would just do whatever he liked

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.280
that was huge

00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:44.541
that was kind of crazy

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.720
the last sign of how I knew I had TRAD wife disease

00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:50.501
was that. Any time I was with my man

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.440
I would just,

00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:53.081
my brain would turn off.

00:01:53.082 --> 00:01:54.481
like I would just

00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:56.081
my brain turned off

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:57.601
that was scary at first,

00:01:57.602 --> 00:01:59.121
I didn't know what to do!

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:00.561
but you know,

00:02:00.562 --> 00:02:04.561
after learning the signs and symptoms of tradwife disease

00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:06.721
I learned that, that's actually a good thing

00:02:06.722 --> 00:02:09.121
because he provides so much for me,

00:02:09.122 --> 00:02:10.378
that he leads for me

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.201
So I don't have to use my brain

00:02:12.202 --> 00:02:13.721
I can just turn it off

00:02:13.722 --> 00:02:16.941
and that's actually a gift in itself

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.320
so don't be scared

00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:21.061
if you suffer from tradwife disease

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.180
I'm here with you

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.180
we can get through this
