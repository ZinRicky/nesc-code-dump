00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
I asked my 59 month old

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:03.241
my 108 month old

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:04.961
and my 144 month old

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:06.281
what they'd like to eat today

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:08.261
and they all agreed on pizza

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.240
I suspected that they were quite hungry

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:11.991
because they were quite grumpy and 

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:13.041
also quite lethargic 

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:14.839
but I knew they wouldn't mind if I took a 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.081
further four halfs of an hour

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.911
for myself to do a quick full glam before 

00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:19.001
getting started on my dough

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.001
and this dough is a family secret

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.561
my ancestors brought this recipe with them to Aotearoa on the Aurora

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:27.801
which was one of the first migrant ships to come here in the 1800s

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:31.261
and this recipe definitely did not come from the Dish website

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.000
I lightly floured my surface and then began to take out

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.441
any passive aggression that I might have towards my life on the dough

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:39.681
and once it was as dense and fluffy as I am

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:43.361
then I popped it into an oiled bowl and set it aside so it could rise

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:45.561
and then it was time to get started on my pizza sauce

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:47.641
and I find this process oddly cathartic

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:50.441
because it reminds me of the lobotomy I got two years ago

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:52.241
best decision that was ever made for me

00:00:52.242 --> 00:00:55.641
I foraged these tomatoes by hand from the shores of Muriwai Beach

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:57.481
and combine them with these baby onions

00:00:57.482 --> 00:00:59.241
which I found at the local market

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:00.801
which we call Woolies 

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:03.401
I pulverised the papercorns with the same methodology

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:04.921
they used on my frontal lobe 

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:06.601
and then I added a few extra things

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:10.041
in an attempt to make these tomatoes not taste like pure fkn cardboard

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:10.921
I added some herbs

00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:13.721
which I pilfered from my neighbour's garden through a gap in the fence

00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:14.761
because I'm not actually

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:17.281
allowed to leave the property without the accompaniment of a man

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:18.241
then I combined the sauce

00:01:18.242 --> 00:01:20.681
which is always my favourite part for some weird reason

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:23.321
then it was time to get started on our mozzarella cheese

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:26.601
and everybody knows that mozzarella cheese taste best with fresh milk

00:01:26.602 --> 00:01:28.881
so I decided to head down to the garden and get some

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:32.001
I also decided to pick up a few fresh eggs for breakfast tomorrow

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:32.961
while I was there

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:34.683
homesteading has been the most rewarding 

00:01:34.684 --> 00:01:36.321
experience I could have ever wished for

00:01:36.322 --> 00:01:38.841
and our garden has never been so bountiful

00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:40.001
blessed be the fruit

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:41.601
I started by heating my raw

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.161
untreated milk to temperature

00:01:43.162 --> 00:01:46.561
and then adding exactly 7 tablespoons of homemade vinegar

00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:49.281
and I find the best way to make your own vinegar is just to wring out

00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:51.081
your husband's socks after he's had a long

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:52.561
hard day sitting on his ass

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:54.241
once the curd is separated from the whey

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:56.921
you just squeeze the curd until the excess water is removed

00:01:56.922 --> 00:01:59.161
and I know it is very physically taxing work

00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:01.547
but I do find I get extra grip strength when I 

00:02:01.548 --> 00:02:03.121
just think about the patriarchy

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.321
and then we heat the whey again

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:06.081
careful not to go past 69 degrees

00:02:06.082 --> 00:02:06.801
because my brother

00:02:06.802 --> 00:02:09.281
father and husband have all forbidden me from using that number

00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:10.121
and I'm not sure why

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:12.561
but I trust that they have my best interest at heart

00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:15.041
and then plunge your two balls into ice cold water

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:16.761
and I promise they won't shrink

00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:20.081
and then 423 and a half minutes after I first started

00:02:20.082 --> 00:02:21.901
it was time to give my dough a second knead

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.640
and at this point

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.601
the children were whinging that they were starving

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:26.561
and I told them not to be so dramatic

00:02:26.562 --> 00:02:27.121
and that - like Christmas-

00:02:27.122 --> 00:02:28.681
dinner was coming

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:31.001
I took my cheesy balls out of the cold water

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:34.521
before thinly slicing them and confirming that the mozzarella was indeed

00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:35.721
squeaky and dense

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:36.601
which is funny enough

00:02:36.602 --> 00:02:39.241
exactly how they describe me on my hospital intake form

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:40.601
right before I had that procedure

00:02:40.602 --> 00:02:43.521
which I can't quite remember whether or not I told you about

00:02:43.522 --> 00:02:45.121
my memory is not what it used to be

00:02:45.122 --> 00:02:46.561
then I assembled the one pizza

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:48.561
which took me literally all day to make

00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:49.241
but it's okay

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:50.801
because I'm from the leisure class

00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:53.761
so I don't actually have to do any real domestic chores

00:02:53.762 --> 00:02:55.161
we have people for that

00:02:55.162 --> 00:02:55.721
at this point

00:02:55.722 --> 00:02:58.441
I was so excited to share my hard work with the children

00:02:58.442 --> 00:03:00.571
but I thought first I'd have a quick taste test 

00:03:00.572 --> 00:03:01.681
to ensure quality control

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:02.601
and as they observed me

00:03:02.602 --> 00:03:04.681
they decided they no longer felt like pizza

00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:06.481
and they actually wanted chicken nuggets

00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:08.351
so back to the kitchen I go
