00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.840
Okay.

00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:03.621
So many people have asked me what's going on in Charleston with Debbie.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.400
Um, at least for me,

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.241
cannot also. Yeah,

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:09.441
we're. We're getting ready for bed.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.661
We're trying something new.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.460
Um, nothing's happening at my house.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.260
We've had a moderately rainy day.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.680
I've run errands. It's like it hasn't been much.

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:21.241
And we live on, um,

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:23.021
like a tidal creek, so I kind of expect.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
Expected at least a little bit of flooding.

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.001
I know it's worse in other places,

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.441
and I know downtown is flooded.

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:30.221
Downtown always floods. Um,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.000
so I hope everybody is safe and hunkering down.

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.052
But as for us, we're good.
