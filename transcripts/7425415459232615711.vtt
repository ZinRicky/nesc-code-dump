00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.500
Trump is not manly Trump is not manly

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.520
reason number one he is not a provider

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:06.040
I mean remember those tax cuts

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:07.320
they didn't help you or me

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:08.600
but they helped his rich buddies

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:09.760
while we were all struggling

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:13.620
he was handing out cash to his billionaire friends like it was candy

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.280
Trump is also not a protector

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.880
he doesn't protect women he literally endangered us with his abortion bans

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.840
and when it came to protecting us during a pandemic

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:24.200
we just learnt that he literally gave covid test to Putin

00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:27.580
instead of protecting us he's also weak

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.520
strong men do not need to compensate and put down other people

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:31.860
to feel good about themselves

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.520
strong men do not put down women or disabled people

00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:37.840
or Haitian immigrants in order to convince you to like them

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:41.320
Donald Trump's levels of insecurity are astronomical

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:42.880
so no Donald Trump is not masculine

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:45.680
in fact he embodies the weakest version of it

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:47.420
I mean I went to the streets

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.700
and asked men to name one manly thing that Donald Trump has done

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.960
and I got a lot of long silences and crickets

00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:56.700
even from men who were saying that they were gonna vote for him

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.980
Kama Harris has bigger balls than Donald Trump
