00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.220
Part of how I parent as a cycle breaker parent

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.260
is overcompensation for the things I did not get in my childhood,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.200
which may or may not be detrimental to my own children

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:14.361
in its own weird way. I'm very aware that I have an anxious attachment,

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:17.361
so I tend to be over protective of my kids.

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:20.081
I tend to be concerned that

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:21.601
if they're off doing something by themselves

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:23.081
that they don't know that I love them.

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:26.241
I wanna make everything special and important

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:29.241
and child centered and magical for them.

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:32.561
I constantly tell them that I love them and that I'm proud of them

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:35.241
and they're the most amazing thing in my entire universe.

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:35.601
And so

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:39.781
I wonder if the trauma that they will receive from me is smothering,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.120
because I received the exact opposite of smothering from my parents,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.400
I was damn sure that the one thing that my kids were gonna know

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:52.441
is how much I love them and how important they are to me.

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:57.261
And I wonder how many of us overcompensating parents,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.000
Pinterest moms, people setting up balloons for every single event,

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.661
every single birthday morning,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.200
making pancakes the shapes of bunny rabbits.

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:09.101
All of us were killing ourselves to try to be a perfect parent.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.840
I wonder how many of us are doing it because we didn't get one

00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:14.321
and we wish we had had one

00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:17.121
and if we would still be perfect to our kids.

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:20.061
Probably would if we did less.
