00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.400
The conversation about the differences of parenting,

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:04.361
from boomer parenting to millennial, respectful,

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:05.161
gentle parenting,

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:06.201
whatever you wanna call it,

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:08.921
often times gets wrapped up in this idea of being grateful

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:10.121
or ungratefulness,

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:11.041
when in reality,

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:14.441
this is actually a conversation being had in the same language.

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:16.541
We're talking about needs being met.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.960
This is Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:20.301
Pause to take a look.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.180
Now, where a lot of older generation parents get really

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.980
tricked up with this whole conversation

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.760
is they feel like we are ungrateful because they provided these,

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:30.961
these baselines, safety,

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:32.281
security, and physiological needs,

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.601
and perhaps they didn't have those growing up.

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:36.721
So talking about needing more or wanting more

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:39.221
or not providing enough when those were met

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.520
does come from a privileged place

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.361
because not everybody gets those met.

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:44.381
However,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.320
if we're talking about doing better for our children than what we had,

00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:51.801
those of us who started with these base levels of needs being met,

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.841
which again, food, safety,

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:55.001
roof over your head,

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:55.401
you know,

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:59.501
even going beyond and above that with opportunities and education,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.740
we are very grateful about these needs being met

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.620
and can still acknowledge that these needs were not met.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.720
Doing better for our kids can start at any one of these levels, right?

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:14.601
As long as we are striving to go up the pyramid.

00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:17.641
So it looks like this commenter did that.

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:20.841
They went above and beyond what they got as kids,

00:01:20.842 --> 00:01:23.161
and they feel like that should be Enough.

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:23.841
And maybe it is.

00:01:23.842 --> 00:01:25.201
I don't know. I'm not their children.

00:01:25.202 --> 00:01:27.901
But I do know that those of us having this conversation

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.400
are also just trying to do better for our kids.

00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:33.961
We're just trying to go up the pyramid for them and for ourselves.

00:01:33.962 --> 00:01:35.901
We have the privilege of knowing

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.680
that these baseline needs are going to be met

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:41.201
simply because of the financial privileges

00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:42.481
that we were either raised with

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:44.161
or we have created for ourselves,

00:01:44.162 --> 00:01:45.041
for our family.

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:48.461
So we are focusing on the psychological upgrading,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.600
basically to foster self esteem,

00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:51.641
love, belonging,

00:01:51.642 --> 00:01:52.841
intimacy, connection.

00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:55.161
Because either we feel like we didn't have that

00:01:55.162 --> 00:01:59.741
or because we were taught how to do that by our loving family.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.880
Those of us that are, like,

00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:04.661
reparenting ourselves and doing this by ourselves,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.760
we take issue with not getting these as kids.

00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:12.361
Not that we're ungrateful for these.

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:13.841
Very grateful for these.

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:17.841
Still wish we had these because we would like to get here,

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:21.508
and we want this for our kids as well.
