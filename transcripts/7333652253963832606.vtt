00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.320
I genuinely mourn who I could have been

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:06.001
like the person that I could have been if I didn't have like ADHD

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.121
just making a video about it

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:13.041
and I didn't realize how heavily my life has been impacted by this thing

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:14.921
like every aspect of my life

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:16.601
like my depression

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:17.921
my you know weight

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:19.721
my you know movement

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:23.881
my desire to get out of bed is all impacted by my ADHD

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:26.361
I I can't communicate with my friends like I

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:27.561
I'm so bad at like

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:29.241
literally just texting my friends back

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:29.921
I don't know what it is

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:32.641
my brain can't do it unless I'm medicated

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:33.401
but first of all

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:35.321
I haven't been able to get my medication in literally

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:36.481
months because of the shortage

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:39.761
like I went to CVS last week and

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:40.681
and my pharmacist was like

00:00:40.682 --> 00:00:44.441
we have a list five pages long of people who can't get their vyvance

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:45.481
like it's not just you

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:47.001
and every time I take my meds I'm like

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:48.241
reminded of like

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:49.601
what it's like to be able to like

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:50.921
function like a person

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:54.921
like having ADHD means that you're fighting with your brain all the time

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.081
it's like my brain is like

00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:57.881
on self destruct mode all the time

00:00:57.882 --> 00:00:59.201
and like ah like

00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:00.701
there are people that just like

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.720
don't have to fight with themselves to do basic daily tasks

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:07.161
and it's just so frustrating

00:01:07.162 --> 00:01:11.041
and ADHD is literally so debilitating

00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:13.961
and I would genuinely not wish this on my worst enemy

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:14.481
and I know like

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:15.401
social media like

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:18.801
kind of has diminished what ADHD is or like

00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:19.441
has made it oh

00:01:19.442 --> 00:01:20.201
I'm just like a quirky

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:21.001
manic pixie dream girl

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:22.701
like no like this

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.760
like this is the most disabling thing about my life

00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:28.521
more so than being a large fat person

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:31.881
my life is more so impacted by my ADHD

00:01:31.882 --> 00:01:35.401
I have such bad executive functioning issue

00:01:35.402 --> 00:01:37.741
I'm so bad at doing anything alone

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.360
not because like I it it it

00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:41.001
my brain literally is in like

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:44.758
buffer mode 90% of the day unless I see someone 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.541
and I just

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.920
I wonder what would have happened if a

00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:49.861
I got diagnosed earlier I

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.800
I love my parents

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:51.921
and I'm not blaming them for this

00:01:51.922 --> 00:01:55.321
but like they were told when I was in preschool that my

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:56.961
my teacher thought that I had ADHD

00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:58.101
but first of all

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240
my parents are immigrants

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:00.201
so like that

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:01.401
they don't believe in that

00:02:01.402 --> 00:02:01.961
but also like

00:02:01.962 --> 00:02:03.181
growing up as a girl

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.880
the way that ADHD presents in US

00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:07.121
is different than the way that it presents in boys

00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:11.281
so like so many girls don't get diagnosed at a young age with ADHD

00:02:11.282 --> 00:02:11.721
and I just a

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:17.601
like wonder what the trajectory of my life would have been had I gotten like

00:02:17.602 --> 00:02:19.321
a diagnosis early on and like

00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:20.561
had tools to

00:02:20.562 --> 00:02:22.001
to exist because now

00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.361
in my adulthood like

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:27.961
I feel like I'm just catching up to all the things that I like

00:02:27.962 --> 00:02:29.641
failed at in my childhood

00:02:29.642 --> 00:02:31.081
like especially school as like

00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:34.581
I genuinely crave and desire to learn

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.360
but school was so hard for me

00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:39.041
like I just I

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:40.601
it was so difficult for me

00:02:40.602 --> 00:02:42.221
and I didn't understand why

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.520
it was so hard for me

00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:44.001
compared to everyone

00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:45.721
I just thought I was lazy like I was

00:02:45.722 --> 00:02:47.221
I just thought that I was lazy

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.360
like maybe I was

00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:49.921
but it wasn't completely that

00:02:49.922 --> 00:02:50.641
god I'm sorry I'm crying

00:02:50.642 --> 00:02:51.521
I'm just like uh

00:02:51.522 --> 00:02:52.641
but like now I know

00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:54.601
it was literally just my brain

00:02:54.602 --> 00:02:55.521
like when I was younger

00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:58.721
one of my favorite things in the entire world was to read

00:02:58.722 --> 00:02:59.681
and then I was like

00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:00.241
I was like 12

00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:01.521
I think when I was 12

00:03:01.522 --> 00:03:03.321
I read maybe 200 books

00:03:03.322 --> 00:03:04.881
and then school started getting more difficult

00:03:04.882 --> 00:03:07.281
and I had to do my readings for school

00:03:07.282 --> 00:03:09.201
but I like my brain couldn't do that

00:03:09.202 --> 00:03:11.101
so then I felt guilty reading books

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.800
so for literally 10 years

00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:14.641
I stopped reading

00:03:14.642 --> 00:03:16.001
from the time that I was like

00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:17.641
12 to the time that I was like 22

00:03:17.642 --> 00:03:18.801
I graduate I like

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:20.161
stopped reading for pleasure

00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:22.281
and it was one of my favorite things in the world to do

00:03:22.282 --> 00:03:22.921
like last year

00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:23.801
I finally read

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:24.641
I've read 38 books

00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:25.281
my goal was 40

00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:25.881
I didn't make it

00:03:25.882 --> 00:03:26.761
but this year

00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:27.441
hopefully it will

00:03:27.442 --> 00:03:29.481
but like I just read for pleasure

00:03:29.482 --> 00:03:30.121
because I could

00:03:30.122 --> 00:03:31.121
because I didn't have assignments

00:03:31.122 --> 00:03:32.081
I had to do that

00:03:32.082 --> 00:03:33.121
were like weighing on me

00:03:33.122 --> 00:03:33.601
so I could just

00:03:33.602 --> 00:03:34.441
like read again

00:03:34.442 --> 00:03:35.781
but also now

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.040
I feel like I'm like

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:38.201
so behind in like

00:03:38.202 --> 00:03:39.081
the things that I should have

00:03:39.082 --> 00:03:41.161
cause I didn't do any of my readings in college

00:03:41.162 --> 00:03:42.521
and I didn't do any of my readings in

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:43.161
in high school

00:03:43.162 --> 00:03:43.961
because like

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.320
my brain didn't want to

00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:46.441
but I want to bring those like

00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:47.601
I'm interested in them

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:51.641
so now I'm reading the books that I should have read in high school

00:03:51.642 --> 00:03:52.641
and in college

00:03:52.642 --> 00:03:55.201
I feel like I wasted my degree and I like

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:56.121
wasted my time

00:03:56.122 --> 00:03:57.141
because I didn't

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.680
learn as much as I could have

00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:01.201
because I have the desire to learn

00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:03.061
I want to know but like

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.160
my brain just like

00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:06.881
wasn't meant to do it in an academic setting

00:04:06.882 --> 00:04:09.641
like my ADHD also affected my disorder eating

00:04:09.642 --> 00:04:12.681
like I was binge eating in high school because um

00:04:12.682 --> 00:04:14.241
I didn't have enough dopamine

00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:16.681
and food is the easiest way to increase your dopamine

00:04:16.682 --> 00:04:18.661
but like if I had just

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.500
if I had just dealt with my ADHD

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.100
it's just this has been

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.680
the most difficult part of my life

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:28.641
the most disabling thing in my life is my ADHD

00:04:28.642 --> 00:04:30.781
and it's just so

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.920
heartbreaking

00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:34.321
and more than anything

00:04:34.322 --> 00:04:34.881
the thing that I I

00:04:34.882 --> 00:04:36.681
I regret the most

00:04:36.682 --> 00:04:37.201
is that like

00:04:37.202 --> 00:04:38.441
I've let it affect my like

00:04:38.442 --> 00:04:39.121
relationship

00:04:39.122 --> 00:04:41.681
I have had so many friends

00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:42.521
business partners

00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:44.381
brands like lose

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.880
broke relationships with them

00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:46.981
burnt bridges

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.920
just because

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.781
I'm incapable of answering

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.800
emails and DMs

00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:51.401
and texts and

00:04:51.402 --> 00:04:51.881
like whatever

00:04:51.882 --> 00:04:53.041
like my closest friends

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:54.601
the only way that they can communicate with me

00:04:54.602 --> 00:04:55.481
is through Facetime

00:04:55.482 --> 00:04:57.001
because I literally

00:04:57.002 --> 00:04:57.721
I don't know

00:04:57.722 --> 00:04:58.161
I think it's

00:04:58.162 --> 00:04:58.921
pathological

00:04:58.922 --> 00:05:00.121
demand avoidance

00:05:00.122 --> 00:05:00.681
I'm not sure if

00:05:00.682 --> 00:05:01.681
I think that's what it's called

00:05:01.682 --> 00:05:02.441
but I just like I

00:05:02.442 --> 00:05:04.161
I literally am like

00:05:04.162 --> 00:05:06.961
I can't do anything that I am supposed to do

00:05:06.962 --> 00:05:08.381
and so I have burnt

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.140
so many bridges

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.460
unintentionally

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.040
because of my brain

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:13.721
and just my it's

00:05:13.722 --> 00:05:14.281
like and it's so

00:05:14.282 --> 00:05:15.521
so stupid like

00:05:15.522 --> 00:05:17.001
responding but it's so

00:05:17.002 --> 00:05:18.401
it gets so overwhelming

00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:19.801
and every day I like

00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:20.521
sit here and I just

00:05:20.522 --> 00:05:21.321
I think about like

00:05:21.322 --> 00:05:23.041
the people that like

00:05:23.042 --> 00:05:25.041
I no longer have in my life or like

00:05:25.042 --> 00:05:25.761
the connections that I

00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:27.441
can no longer rely on

00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:29.161
because I ruined that relationship

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:29.641
and also like

00:05:29.642 --> 00:05:30.681
people probably think I hate them

00:05:30.682 --> 00:05:31.081
because I'm not

00:05:31.082 --> 00:05:32.181
responding cause if I

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.960
text to someone

00:05:32.961 --> 00:05:33.721
and they didn't respond to me

00:05:33.722 --> 00:05:34.801
I would think that they hate me

00:05:34.802 --> 00:05:35.721
but I do the same thing

00:05:35.722 --> 00:05:36.521
and it just like it

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.640
it's just my brain

00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:39.161
so I have to apologize to every single

00:05:39.162 --> 00:05:40.721
new person that I ever meet and be like

00:05:40.722 --> 00:05:42.281
I'm so sorry I can't I

00:05:42.282 --> 00:05:43.321
I can't text

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:45.001
like call me anyways

00:05:45.002 --> 00:05:45.921
I'm sorry I'm like I

00:05:45.922 --> 00:05:46.681
I'm sorry for

00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:47.321
the big rant

00:05:47.322 --> 00:05:48.801
but I guess reminder that ADHD

00:05:48.802 --> 00:05:49.641
is a disability

00:05:49.642 --> 00:05:50.601
like that's what it is

00:05:50.602 --> 00:05:51.761
and I think because you know

00:05:51.762 --> 00:05:52.801
everyone deals with it differently

00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:53.561
and I think it looks different

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:54.241
in different people

00:05:54.242 --> 00:05:55.081
and like I think

00:05:55.082 --> 00:05:55.601
because so many

00:05:55.602 --> 00:05:56.241
people have it

00:05:56.242 --> 00:05:57.441
we forget but like

00:05:57.442 --> 00:05:58.521
ADHD is a disability

00:05:58.522 --> 00:06:00.461
and it is a disabling

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.440
thing to live with

00:06:01.441 --> 00:06:02.121
I don't know I I

00:06:02.122 --> 00:06:04.121
I would like to find

00:06:04.122 --> 00:06:04.681
the right meds

00:06:04.682 --> 00:06:05.321
cause vyvance

00:06:05.322 --> 00:06:06.461
like it works

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.760
obviously a little bit

00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:08.681
but like not

00:06:08.682 --> 00:06:09.441
well enough and I

00:06:09.442 --> 00:06:10.641
I need to find new meds

00:06:10.642 --> 00:06:11.921
that I can actually get

00:06:11.922 --> 00:06:12.681
and that actually like

00:06:12.682 --> 00:06:14.161
work anyways

00:06:14.162 --> 00:06:14.881
if you have ADHD

00:06:14.882 --> 00:06:15.721
let the serve as a reminder

00:06:15.722 --> 00:06:17.407
that you are definitely not alone
