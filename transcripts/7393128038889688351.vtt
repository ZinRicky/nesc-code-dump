00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Arabella and Olympia wrote a list of recipes I should make

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:04.841
with all the peaches from our tree,

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:08.141
so I chose the easiest one to make Peach Popsicles.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.040
I'm using three cups of my frozen

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:12.441
ripe peaches combined with a homemade yogurt,

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:14.301
cream cheese straight from the farm,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.040
100% pasture raised raw dairy,

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.001
and then a spoonful of raw honey,

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:19.721
bit of vanilla

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:23.321
and a pinch of mineral rich sea salt is all we put into this creamy,

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.001
nutrient dense frozen treat.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:28.321
I filled the popsicle molds and let those fully freeze overnight.

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:30.721
When I was ready to remove them from their molds,

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:32.241
I melted some good ingredient

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:34.641
dark chocolate chips with unrefined coconut oil

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:36.201
until it was nice and creamy.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.201
I dunked each popsicle into the melted chocolate

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:42.701
and then let the chocolate set on a Parchment lined baking sheet.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.760
They firmed up almost immediately and quickly. Thereafter.

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:48.381
I placed each popsicle into its own bag

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.680
so that I could store them nicely in the freezer

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:52.641
for the kids to have their own snacks.

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:54.521
These are gut friendly, low sugar,

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:56.081
and they're free of food dyes,

00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:58.001
artificial flavors, and seed oils.

00:00:58.002 --> 00:00:59.381
They're perfect for summer!
