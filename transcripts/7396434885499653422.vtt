My husband really wanted a Fanta with his meal today,

00:02.761 --> 00:04.041
and since we didn't have any,

00:04.042 --> 00:05.801
I decided to make him some.

00:05.802 --> 00:08.481
Fanta always reminds me of summer spent at the beach,

00:08.482 --> 00:10.521
so I ended up craving it as well.

00:10.522 --> 00:13.261
I started by steeping some gentian tea.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.920
After about five minutes, I popped that in the fridge so it could cool.

00:16.921 --> 00:17.561
In the meantime,

00:17.562 --> 00:21.721
I zested about four oranges and made sure to get all the skin off

00:21.722 --> 00:25.501
before combining that with some sugar and really working it in.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.640
After it was all combined,

00:26.641 --> 00:29.121
I put it away in an airtight container

00:29.122 --> 00:31.281
so that the sugar could pull out the oils

00:31.282 --> 00:33.721
for about four hours, and after that,

00:33.722 --> 00:36.261
I started combining all of my ingredients.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.040
Poured my tea, some water,

00:38.041 --> 00:41.041
the sugar mixture, some ascorbic acid,

00:41.042 --> 00:44.401
malic acid, and citric acid into my blender,

00:44.402 --> 00:47.001
started blending that until everything was combined,

00:47.002 --> 00:49.741
and then passed it through a fine mesh strainer,

00:49.920 --> 00:52.280
poured some of the Fanta syrup into a glass,

00:52.281 --> 00:54.441
top that with cold sparkling water,

00:54.442 --> 00:56.041
and our Fanta was done.

00:56.042 --> 00:59.481
This tasted so divine that lucky ended up chugging it.

00:59.482 --> 01:02.221
It was exactly what I was craving as well.
