00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.840
I think people misunderstand the entire nature of gratitude

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.361
with all of the posts I make

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:08.841
which a lot of the times have to do with setting boundaries with family members

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:12.601
or creating space for self care in motherhood

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:16.281
the number one critique I get is that I sound ungrateful

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.801
and I think this really comes down to the nature of how we view women

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:21.081
girls and mothers

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:23.781
we truly only value women

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.580
who are prepared to be selfless within their roles in life

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.640
the second you start advocating for your needs or setting boundaries

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:33.561
you are called ungrateful or selfish or entitled

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:34.641
that's the other one I get

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:37.161
and the reality is maybe this is my neurodivergent brain

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.721
but like multiple things can be true at once

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:41.241
I am in love with being a mom

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:43.401
I gave up my career to be a stay at home mom

00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:44.861
I homeschool my kids

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.640
but that doesn't mean that I

00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:49.321
don't want Mother's Day to be a day where I feel special

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:51.401
and pampered and important and celebrated

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:54.021
I can love and appreciate and respect my own mother

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.600
while still setting boundaries with how she treats me

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.121
I can appreciate the relationship that my in laws

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:01.561
or extended family have in my children's life

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:03.721
and still expect them to treat me with respect

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:06.381
and adhere to my boundaries for their care and safety

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.520
these things are never mutually exclusive

00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:10.601
but the amount that it triggers people

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:13.761
that a woman could possibly set boundaries for herself

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:17.881
for the people in her life and for her own mental health

00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:22.201
shows just how much we expect women to stay silent

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:23.741
to be agreeable

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.500
to be subservient

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.320
I have dedicated my entire life to the service of my family

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:32.581
both before I had kids and got married as a daughter

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.700
and now as a wife and mother

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.520
and I only recently Learned how to advocate for myself

00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:39.441
and it is very

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:42.941
very telling how that rubs people the wrong way

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.320
because I never said I was not grateful for everything

00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:48.721
and all the people in my life

00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:53.581
we are just so used to women not asking for what they need

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.420
we would rather a woman burn out than be disagreeable
