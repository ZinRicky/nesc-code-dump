00:00.080 --> 00:01.300
Song.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.700
That's what we do.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.960
We got a whole box of OG makeup,

00:22.961 --> 00:24.661
and Mike is here,

00:25.600 --> 00:27.140
so we're gonna go through it.

00:27.800 --> 00:28.780
Good. In yours

00:30.720 --> 00:32.720
while improving the appearance of texture,

00:32.721 --> 00:34.701
suppleness, and signs of aging.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.060
Bring it on.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.400
Little goes a long way. So good.

00:40.401 --> 00:42.281
Well, that does feel really smooth.

00:42.282 --> 00:43.621
Oh, this is nice.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.320
Yeah, it feels really good.

00:45.321 --> 00:47.861
Kind of bouncy, a little bit under my eye.

00:48.000 --> 00:48.520
Oh, yeah,

00:48.521 --> 00:50.161
that's nice. Okay,

00:50.162 --> 00:51.941
so now we got our base on.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.660
Starting off now with this.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.860
Hi,

01:02.960 --> 01:05.040
George. Hi. Bronzy.

01:05.041 --> 01:06.001
Oh, I love that.

01:06.002 --> 01:07.761
It's like a moisturizer. Wow,

01:07.762 --> 01:09.041
that blends really? Yeah,

01:09.042 --> 01:10.141
that's amazing.

01:10.960 --> 01:14.080
I wanna do it good. What?

01:14.081 --> 01:17.021
There is, I think. No,

01:19.240 --> 01:20.260
just playing.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.180
Ja,

01:29.880 --> 01:30.680
Ja.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.380
So moisturizing.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.660
Yeah, just keep it.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.260
So here's the mascara.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.820
This nice mascara.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.260
Haha.

01:50.120 --> 01:50.940
A

01:52.320 --> 01:53.140
pink.

01:54.360 --> 01:55.940
It's like that.

02:02.720 --> 02:03.815
Я знову останню
