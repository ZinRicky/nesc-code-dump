00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.440
So my kids started their new co op this week.

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:03.401
Um, if you don't know,

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:04.881
we are a homeschool family.

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:07.001
This past year was our first year of homeschool,

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.441
and I did everything

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:12.701
except for the things that I did outsource to lessons or programs.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.700
I taught them ELA, Science,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.680
social studies, um,

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:19.481
and all of their art and music stuff,

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:21.301
for the most part at home.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.720
And this time we're doing a co op this year.

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.961
And it has been a really interesting journey,

00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:27.721
because when I first started to homeschool,

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:28.481
I always said, oh,

00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:30.641
I would do a pot where I would do a co op.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.440
there has to be one or two days a week that they're with other kids

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:34.761
and they're out of the house, and,

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:36.581
you know, I can get stuff done.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.300
And that just didn't manifest.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.640
In the Charleston area.

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:43.081
There were a lot of homeschool groups and co ops and stuff,

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:45.441
but just none that really fit what we were looking for,

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:47.761
because they were either Christian based

00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:49.521
with the curriculum they were using,

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:50.801
which is fine. We just.

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:52.321
That is not the faith that we follow,

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:54.201
so it wasn't gonna be a good fit for us.

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:58.261
And or they are super outdoorsy unschoolers,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.540
crunchy. Um,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.680
and that wasn't our philosophy on educating either.

00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:06.161
So it was really, really tricky.

00:01:06.162 --> 00:01:09.921
And I think I finally have found, like,

00:01:09.922 --> 00:01:11.841
an educational home and community,

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:13.601
and I'm so, so excited.

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:18.361
It has been touted As a academically rigorous, um,

00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:21.561
but secular based education.

00:01:21.562 --> 00:01:25.401
And definitely incorporates a lot of nature as well.

00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:27.681
And outdoor time and social,

00:01:27.682 --> 00:01:29.921
emotional learning and tolerance.

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:33.381
And all of the stuff that we were already looking for.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.020
They just. They just had the whole package. Um,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.400
and I'm really, really excited for my kids.

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:40.481
They already seem to be, like,

00:01:40.482 --> 00:01:42.941
making social connections in their grade levels.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.840
Um, the kids are separated by age range,

00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:50.521
and then they can definitely do classes that are for, um,

00:01:50.522 --> 00:01:52.601
kids a little bit older or younger,

00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:54.441
depending on their aptitude at that subject.

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:57.181
So it's a very fluid concept.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.800
It looks like when, you know,

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.241
if a kid is not challenged in the class,

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:03.001
they can move to a different class.

00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:04.761
That's maybe with older kids.

00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:07.081
That will keep them challenged and engaged,

00:02:07.082 --> 00:02:08.441
which I really like that option.

00:02:08.442 --> 00:02:10.081
That's one of the things I love about homeschool

00:02:10.082 --> 00:02:14.801
is that you're continuously adjusting to meet your kids needs.

00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:17.401
Now, that doesn't mean I don't expect to be able to change classes,

00:02:17.402 --> 00:02:21.241
like in the middle of a unit or in the middle of the lesson,

00:02:21.242 --> 00:02:22.121
but again, I don't know.

00:02:22.122 --> 00:02:23.381
This is all brand new.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.800
We will be doing a take home curriculum from this program Wednesday,

00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:28.721
Thursday, Friday.

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:31.921
And we are still keeping up with our extracurriculars

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:35.041
and our supplemental stuff that we do outside of the home.

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:38.221
So they are also doing a Spanish lesson,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280
an immersion program once a Week,

00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:43.541
they are doing instrument music lessons.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.440
They each have an extracurricular that they're into right now

00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.841
that they love. My daughter's doing musical theater

00:02:48.842 --> 00:02:50.381
and my son is doing LaCrosse.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.960
So they're finding their.

00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.441
They're finding their bliss and leaning into it,

00:02:54.442 --> 00:02:58.401
which I love. And we still have that time to be together as a family

00:02:58.402 --> 00:03:00.661
and travel and have adventures

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.880
and do unit studies at home

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:05.121
and other supplemental stuff that we wanna do.

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:07.081
So this is a big step.

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:09.281
I can't wait to take you guys along on this journey,

00:03:09.282 --> 00:03:12.281
because co op life is very different than homeschooling at home.

00:03:12.282 --> 00:03:14.841
And I kind of brought you guys along on what we were doing last year,

00:03:14.842 --> 00:03:16.441
and this year's gonna look a little bit different.

00:03:16.442 --> 00:03:19.881
So stay tuned, and if you have any questions,

00:03:19.882 --> 00:03:20.881
you can leave them in the comments.

00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:22.481
I'm not gonna answer anything specific about,

00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:27.061
like, my kids specific program or location for safety reasons.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.960
But if you have any questions about co ops,

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:32.421
about curriculum, about homeschooling,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.320
about the different ways to homeschool,

00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:36.841
please leave them them in the comments,

00:03:36.842 --> 00:03:38.721
and I'll answer them as best I can. Or,

00:03:38.722 --> 00:03:39.241
you know,

00:03:39.242 --> 00:03:41.881
collaboratively answer them if you have the answers in the comments

00:03:41.882 --> 00:03:42.681
as well.
