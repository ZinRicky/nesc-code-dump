00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.080
Can we please stop shitting on motherhood and children

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:06.641
and start placing that blame on our culture where it belongs?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.760
I'm so tired of all the negative rhetoric around motherhood and babies.

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:11.701
Like, oh,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.200
just wait until you never sleep again.

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:14.881
Oh, my god,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:17.301
don't expect anything from your husband.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.800
You're gonna be so alone.

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.481
And just wait till the postpartum blues hit in and, oh, wait,

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:24.281
you're gonna be so sleep deprived

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:26.281
you might actually harm your children.

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:27.361
Guys, just to be clear,

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:31.261
that is not motherhood, and that is not babies and children.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.080
That is our culture 110,000%.

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:37.441
The amount of negative advice that I got from moms

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.241
while I was pregnant was just absurd.

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:41.401
Like, literally obscene.

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:43.961
And all it did was make you fear motherhood.

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:44.921
Like, I remember thinking,

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:47.121
I'm one of those that does not do well off no sleep.

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:47.961
And I was like, oh,

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:48.561
my god. Like,

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:51.681
what if I hurt my baby? What if I get really depressed

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:54.501
because I am so incredibly freaking tired?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.600
Everyone's like, you won't sleep again for the next three years.

00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:59.001
You're gonna go stir crazy.

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.281
The only adult you're gonna talk to is Miss Rachel on your TV.

00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:04.701
I've said this before and I'm gonna say it again.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.520
Motherhood was never meant to be that difficult.

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:08.721
Yes, it's hard,

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:10.081
it's tough, it is not an easy job.

00:01:10.082 --> 00:01:13.261
I'm not at all gonna degrade what I do at home every single day.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.680
But back in the day,

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:19.921
We weren't expected to do all the things that stay at home moms do now.

00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:22.481
You weren't expected to be a full time freaking maid,

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:26.041
a full time chef, a full time home educator,

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:29.321
a full time chauffeur. Back in the day,

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.921
people had communes, okay?

00:01:31.922 --> 00:01:34.361
It takes a village to raise a child.

00:01:34.362 --> 00:01:38.941
That is because women stayed home while the men went to work,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.880
and they stayed home and raised the children.

00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:42.521
And if you were a postpartum mom,

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:44.721
your prime job was literally

00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:47.921
to sit there and make sure that that child had nutrients

00:01:47.922 --> 00:01:49.721
and was being nursed every day

00:01:49.722 --> 00:01:51.741
that it was held, when it was cried.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.440
You slept when the baby slept,

00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:54.681
even if you had other children,

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:57.361
because other moms, other aunts,

00:01:57.362 --> 00:01:59.281
other neighbors, other sisters,

00:01:59.282 --> 00:02:01.701
other nieces would all come in,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.080
and if you needed a nap, they're like,

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.361
let me help with the baby.

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:07.681
If the village needed to be clean or the hut needed to be clean,

00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:10.561
they had other women cleaning and cooking.

00:02:10.562 --> 00:02:16.221
Your job was literally to provide nutrients to your child.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.200
My god, my child was chewing on my little suction cup,

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:20.581
and I found it.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.840
Okay? The phenomenon of isolating mothers

00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:27.021
did not happen until the turn of the century,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.820
really, closer to 1950s,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.200
when they started giving home loans to vets,

00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:37.601
and they started getting wives and moving outside of the city,

00:02:37.602 --> 00:02:39.601
and some even, you know,

00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:42.441
conquering the west, like California and Texas.

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:46.201
And you Were pretty much there was no homesteading or village.

00:02:46.202 --> 00:02:47.681
It was just you and your family

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:50.241
trying to get farmland from the government,

00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:53.201
move away from the city, try to become self sufficient,

00:02:53.202 --> 00:02:54.401
you know, all the things.

00:02:54.402 --> 00:02:58.461
But historically, women with children still lived with their families

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.040
or with their husbands families.

00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.401
They still had post menopausal women that would take care of them.

00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:05.841
They would let them bleed in a tent when they were on their periods.

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:08.541
They weren't expected to work and do all the crazy things.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.340
Motherhood was honored, your cycle was honored,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.040
childbearing was honored. And yes,

00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:18.321
it's difficult, but it was not what it is now.

00:03:18.322 --> 00:03:20.361
And you see it nowadays even more with, like,

00:03:20.362 --> 00:03:22.721
military wives. I have a lot of friends that are military wives,

00:03:22.722 --> 00:03:26.201
and they become very isolated because why

00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:29.281
they're moving from fort to fort or base to base with their husbands,

00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:31.681
and all they have are other women to rely on.

00:03:31.682 --> 00:03:32.601
And at the end of the day,

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:37.121
making friends is hard. Unless you come up with a mommy and me group,

00:03:37.122 --> 00:03:40.901
you're stuck at home. There's days I'm stuck at home alone.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.360
Now, this is not because I'm not close with my family,

00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:45.481
but mainly, like,

00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:49.501
my husband works out of state and he's a farmer,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.740
so I'm home a lot, kind of doing just the single parent role,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.240
and he provides phenomenally for us.

00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:58.561
Um,

00:03:58.562 --> 00:04:03.181
but this is kind of the state of our journey that We're in right now,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.480
um, until,

00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:06.001
you know, he grows the business more,

00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:08.121
which he's going to. He's killing it right now.

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:11.941
But my point is, that's the only reason I'm home alone,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.880
Manning the ship by myself,

00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:15.281
doing everything. Mom,

00:04:15.282 --> 00:04:17.241
dad role. It's cooking,

00:04:17.242 --> 00:04:20.141
it's cleaning, it's the education,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.160
it's. I'm the family doctor.

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:24.121
Like, everything is by myself.

00:04:24.122 --> 00:04:25.761
And I am tired, I am sleep deprived

00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:27.761
and I have a teething toddler in there.

00:04:27.762 --> 00:04:30.201
And unfortunately, my family can't even help that much

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:31.921
because modern feminism, boss,

00:04:31.922 --> 00:04:34.321
babe culture. My parents are still working,

00:04:34.322 --> 00:04:35.361
my mother is still working,

00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:37.261
she can't retire because of inflation,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.940
um, and bidonomics.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.040
There's just so much that goes into this.

00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:46.441
But stop degrading motherhood.

00:04:46.442 --> 00:04:49.641
Like, that's the reason that we're in this place,

00:04:49.642 --> 00:04:52.041
because it's not. You choosing to have a child

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:55.041
doesn't mean that you are automatically gonna be sleep deprived

00:04:55.042 --> 00:04:57.521
or alone. We choose to be alone most times.

00:04:57.522 --> 00:04:58.901
Most, like,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.640
millennials don't even want their freaking mother's input

00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:05.601
or help from their in laws.

00:05:05.602 --> 00:05:06.401
Like,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.580
sometimes I have to go outside of myself to break that

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.000
and break that pattern and actually call my in laws and say,

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:15.161
you know what? I need help today.

00:05:15.162 --> 00:05:16.401
I don't wanna be a helicopter mom.

00:05:16.402 --> 00:05:17.281
Like, take him,

00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:18.361
do whatever you want with him,

00:05:18.362 --> 00:05:20.481
I need to sleep, I need to nap.

00:05:20.482 --> 00:05:21.801
But we don't do that anymore.

00:05:21.802 --> 00:05:25.641
We don't rely on others. We all have this modern day feminism.

00:05:25.642 --> 00:05:28.041
I'm an Independent. I can do whatever I want.

00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:28.961
But then at the same time,

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:29.721
we sit on TikTok

00:05:29.722 --> 00:05:32.841
and we bitch all day long about how hard it is to be a freaking mom,

00:05:32.842 --> 00:05:35.321
when in reality, it's not the mom or the motherhood

00:05:35.322 --> 00:05:38.161
or the child who's teething and not letting you sleep.

00:05:38.162 --> 00:05:40.481
It's the fact that our culture sucks.

00:05:40.482 --> 00:05:45.541
So as an example, I went to a birthday party, slash, like, um,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.600
baby shower for someone that I didn't even know,

00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:51.361
but they were passing around these cards saying,

00:05:51.362 --> 00:05:53.401
give your advice to your. To the moms.

00:05:53.402 --> 00:05:55.241
Now, I live down here on the border,

00:05:55.242 --> 00:05:56.321
all right, by Mexico,

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.101
so I'm. I'm.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.080
I am a minority, um,

00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:02.601
and she was Hispanic.

00:06:02.602 --> 00:06:08.681
And all the cards from the white moms were just trash.

00:06:08.682 --> 00:06:12.141
It was like, don't expect to sleep for the next three years.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.900
Don't expect any help from your husband. Um,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.040
one and done. You know,

00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:20.921
get a vasectomy after he's had to get your tubes tied.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:24.741
Like, it was terrible shit advice from our white culture.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.560
And then, like,

00:06:25.561 --> 00:06:28.641
all the Hispanic advice, and I'm looking at them like,

00:06:28.642 --> 00:06:31.561
she's not gonna have to worry about that because she's Latina.

00:06:31.562 --> 00:06:33.921
Like, she has her mom helping her.

00:06:33.922 --> 00:06:36.401
She has her abuela, she has her nieces,

00:06:36.402 --> 00:06:38.481
her sabrinas, her primos.

00:06:38.482 --> 00:06:40.201
Like, she has all the.

00:06:40.202 --> 00:06:44.261
The support because their culture kept to that.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.520
And the only ones that don't hear an El Paso, honestly,

00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:49.021
just because they have been

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.840
I can't use that word on TikTok.

00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:55.501
Um, they have been, um.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.520
Their culture has kind of been washed out by our crap American culture.

00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:00.121
Okay, they.

00:07:00.122 --> 00:07:01.701
We also did it with their food.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.640
So I was laughing because I knew that, like,

00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:09.521
she had her family support and her parents and, like,

00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:11.281
all this advice they gave was crap.

00:07:11.282 --> 00:07:12.601
Like, I gave real advice,

00:07:12.602 --> 00:07:14.641
you know, co sleeping. Awesome.

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.481
Do it. That's how you get the most sleep.

00:07:16.482 --> 00:07:20.481
Um, I gave some other advice that I probably can't say on TikTok

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:21.901
because I'll get banned again.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.820
But my point is,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.980
while I am sucking out my wrinkles, you see him?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.260
Stop blaming children and motherhood.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.960
Like, if we just finally wrap our brains around that,

00:07:36.961 --> 00:07:39.401
what we have done in the last hundred,

00:07:39.402 --> 00:07:42.161
maybe 200 years is so nuanced,

00:07:42.162 --> 00:07:46.621
including diet, child rearing, everything, marriage,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.140
everything is so nuanced that we were Guinea pigs

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.320
and we are now the result

00:07:52.321 --> 00:07:53.721
and the long term effects

00:07:53.722 --> 00:07:57.641
of what we started doing at the turn of the century. And.

00:07:57.642 --> 00:07:58.801
And we sat here

00:07:58.802 --> 00:08:00.921
and we thought that we were gonna be better than our parents

00:08:00.922 --> 00:08:02.601
and our grandparents and our great grandparents,

00:08:02.602 --> 00:08:04.121
and we were gonna fight biology

00:08:04.122 --> 00:08:06.381
that has existed for thousands of years,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.960
and it's not true. So, yeah,

00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:10.881
the minute we just start wrapping our brains around that,

00:08:10.882 --> 00:08:11.921
things have to change. And guess what?

00:08:11.922 --> 00:08:13.261
You see a lot of it right now.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.200
You see a lot of Millennial families like my family,

00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:17.681
that are, like,

00:08:17.682 --> 00:08:20.701
moving out with their families and family compounds,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.420
they're getting with their best friends and their brothers

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.440
and they're building houses next to each other

00:08:25.441 --> 00:08:28.741
and they're homesteading. And we're going back to milling our own grain

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.480
and cooking right for our family

00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:33.361
and not doing seed oils and not doing all the nuance crap

00:08:33.362 --> 00:08:35.841
that they told us was so good for us for years.

00:08:35.842 --> 00:08:40.581
We're getting back into the village mentality of child raising,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.639
and that is freaking beautiful.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.881
So anyway, that is my, um,

00:08:45.882 --> 00:08:46.941
10 minute rant,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.400
because both babies actually somehow got to sleep the same time,

00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:54.221
so I had a moment to myself.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.894
Love y'all.
