00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.440
I come to you from my kitchen

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:04.581
as a woman who did not listen to those diabolical lies.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.520
I went to college,

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.641
but it was only to find my missus degree,

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:08.881
only to find my husband

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:12.801
and the man that would be able to help me find my true calling

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:14.701
of becoming a wife and mother.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.680
And I did that at 24 years old.

00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:20.121
I found him. We got married at 26 and immediately started having kids.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:22.921
My first child was born at 27 years old.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.081
I still felt a little old,

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:25.761
but I was excited to get started.

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:27.141
And my true happiness.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.200
We went on to have children every two years for four children total.

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.321
And even though one of them was disabled,

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:37.421
I chose against abortion and I kept my baby.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.260
I loved and served my family every single day.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.920
Until I woke up and realized the fucking lies were that.

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:49.321
That would make me happy.

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:52.421
And now, 15 years later,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.320
I'm finally using my college degree.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:01:02.001
Yesterday was my first day on the job using my fucking college degree.

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:04.341
And I went to bed

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.520
feeling so much more fulfilled than I ever thought was possible.

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:14.161
The joy in my heart to know that I did know myself.

00:01:14.162 --> 00:01:15.841
I knew what the fuck I wanted.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.281
I knew what I was doing.

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:19.001
And I was lying to myself

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.821
by thinking that I could be this mousey little princess

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.240
that just sits behind closed doors and supports another man

00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:27.861
for Him to achieve all of his dreams.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.200
That's the fucking diabolical lie.

00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:34.721
I hope every single woman in the graduating class of 2024

00:01:34.722 --> 00:01:37.261
and every year after that.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.900
Follows their dream in their heart and finds true happiness.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.820
Because being a mother is not all that you are created for.
