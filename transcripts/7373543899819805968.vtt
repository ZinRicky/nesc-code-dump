00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.824
we're renovating our 68 year old 

00:00:01.825 --> 00:00:03.040
family home on a budget

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:05.073
and I'm excited because today is the day our 

00:00:05.074 --> 00:00:06.520
kitchen finally gets her glow up

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:08.849
but I'm also oblivious to the minor shit storm 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.940
that may or may not be brewing 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.760
and I'm gonna cut a long story short here

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.560
but this kitchen is actually not that old

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.517
it's got great bones I'm just personally not 

00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:17.040
vibing the black and grey aesthetic

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.000
the kitchen is also on the shady side of the house

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.120
and I don't mean the side that my husband lives in

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.280
I mean the side that doesn't get a whole lot of natural light 

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.166
so it's on the same side as the lounge if you 

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:26.560
caught any of that room renovation

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:26.920
anyway

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:28.637
point being the light that it does get 

00:00:28.638 --> 00:00:30.400
is being absorbed by these dark finishes

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:32.720
making it feel a whole lot darker than it needs to be

00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:35.760
so initially I started toying with the idea of maybe painting the tiles

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.920
maybe painting the bench and giving the space a bit of an aesthetic refresh

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:41.360
but also I give my kitchens a really hard life

00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:43.920
I've got three children and I'm in this space all the time

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:45.330
so I didn't wanna have to turn around and 

00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:46.740
redo it in two years do you know what I mean 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.920
so one day like 10 months ago now

00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:51.160
I went to go browse stone at Cosentino

00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:51.880
and it turns out

00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:53.380
you can't window shop for benchtops 

00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:54.840
without absolutely falling in love 

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:57.360
and then I found a sink and a tap and some tiles that I love

00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:59.728
and anyway - almost a year of manifestation later -

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.160
cut to: demolishing my kitchen

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.840
our fabricators were Architectural Stone and they came and measured up

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:05.280
and from there it was a waiting game

00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:06.600
waiting for our install day

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.760
And they were kind enough to offer to help us remove our existing countertops

00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:11.680
and honestly I'm bloody grateful that they did

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:13.640
because I don't have enough muscles for that job

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:16.720
quick side story but we spent a few years renovating our first home

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.800
and now we've been working on this house for a year

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:20.360
and if I've learnt just one thing

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:23.440
it said it's basically fkn impossible to do a room without a hiccup

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:25.600
so naturally this room was no exception

00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:27.440
when it came time to install on the bench tops 

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.080
unfortunately there was a hiccup

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:31.120
it's nobody's fault it just is what it is

00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:32.047
and what it is is 

00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:34.160
dishes in the shower for the next 2 weeks

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.382
but the end is in sight, so come back for the update
