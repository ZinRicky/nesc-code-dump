00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
I wasn't planning on getting on here today.

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.841
In fact, I wasn't planning on getting dressed or going outside

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:06.441
or checking social media at all,

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:07.481
because I live in Charleston,

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:10.241
South Carolina, and every time I go outside today,

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.681
I see a let's go, Brandon T-shirt.

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:14.381
I see people reveling in Celebration.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.680
And if you are like me, if you are a little blueberry in a cherry pie,

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:20.341
I wanted to come here and talk to you.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.140
Charleston County voted blue,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.780
and I think that's important.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.240
It doesn't insulate us from what is going to be the red wave

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:31.501
or the majority of our friends and acquaintances and neighbors

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.600
who are celebrating Donald Trump's win.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.541
However,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.820
what it does keep is a good deal of our friends a little bit safer.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.680
Um, our queer friends,

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:44.801
our trans friends, our women of color

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:50.101
who have tirelessly been working in this city for Equality and equity,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.380
who have been carrying the banner of progressive values

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.040
for longer than we got on the train,

00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:58.241
that's for sure. So today's gonna be a hard day.

00:00:58.242 --> 00:01:00.561
It's gonna be hard week. It's gonna be really insufferable,

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:01.641
actually, up until January,

00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:02.801
and then we can all collectively

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:05.461
hold our breath and see just how bad things are gonna get.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.000
And while I sit here scared,

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.341
I also know that I occupy the privilege of being white,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.600
of having a husband who doesn't seek to objectify

00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:19.681
or subject me to a patriarchal

00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:21.341
strong arm in my household.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.800
I Have parents who are also Democrats,

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:25.901
which is very nice

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460
because I don't have to excuse their votes.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.020
And I know that I'm not done.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.280
I know that the privileges that I occupy

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:37.621
mean that I am uniquely responsible

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.500
to both do the work and call in other people with equal privilege.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.720
This may feel like two steps back,

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:46.141
and it is.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.300
But you know what comes after that?

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.540
A giant leap forward. So

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.740
stay the course.
