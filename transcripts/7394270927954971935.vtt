00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.520
Here's everything I make for breakfast on the farm

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.641
as a mom who eats an ancestral diet

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:06.401
and as someone who avoids seed oils,

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:08.721
artificial sugars, dyes and preservatives.

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:11.041
We start by walking over to the vegetable garden

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:12.501
and doing some harvesting,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.820
focusing on the overgrown summer squash.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.400
Squash can be so versatile

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:17.921
and my favorite thing to do right now

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:20.961
is shave them thin with a mandolin for a squash salad.

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:22.681
We collect the eggs from the chickens,

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:25.521
say hi to the cows who were just moved to a fresh salad bar,

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:28.641
and then put our ingredients together to get breakfast started.

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:31.601
On the menu our 100% grass fed buddivores,

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:33.781
a traditional South African sausage,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.340
corn free soy free pasta, raised egg,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.120
summer squash

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:39.961
and leftover oats that were soaked overnight before cooking.

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:43.201
I finished off the eggs by drizzling some schmaltz over the yolks,

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:46.961
creating a crispy white and perfectly sealed yolk with a soft center.

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:48.721
Breakfast was simple and delicious

00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:51.457
and we all jumped in the pool afterwards to cool off.
