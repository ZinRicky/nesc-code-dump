00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.040
Okay, so there is a total blizzard right now.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.200
Look how much snow there is.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.920
I have no power right now.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.520
No power right now.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.840
But thank god I got this freaking thing from the TikTok shop.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.960
It's solar powered,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.740
so I can just set this thing in the window

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.840
and keep my phone charged and keep doing things.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.400
So I'm just gonna stay snuggled with my dog.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.540
Oh, and we can enjoy the fucking weather.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.400
Kind of whatever this thing is.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.440
I'm so glad I got this.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.000
This isn't just for the zombie apocalypse and for fucking peppers.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.180
This is for, like,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.480
real life shit,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.100
like a normal fucking spring blizzard.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.160
It's, like, right here.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.480
If you want one from the TikTok shop,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.300
I highly recommend it.
