00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.040
So I saw this,

00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:04.041
and it's literally just a video of this girl who was, like,

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:05.681
taking her Aquaphor and filling it into, like,

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:08.081
little lip gloss thingies.

00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:08.721
You know what I mean?

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:09.521
Like, little, like,

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:10.361
see, like, those little, like,

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:11.761
lip gloss tubes, right?

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:13.001
But Aquaphor is really dense.

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:13.961
It doesn't really work like that.

00:00:13.962 --> 00:00:16.721
Let me put you on something even better. Okay,

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:18.801
basically, this is a Burt's Bees pop socket.

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.241
And it comes with, like,

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:22.361
Burt's Bees little Chapstick,

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:23.041
but I don't like it.

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:24.081
I think it's too waxy,

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:25.941
so I just fill it with Aquaphor instead.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.560
I need you to understand, I cannot function without this phone case.

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:32.741
So this is a Burt's Bees pop socket.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.140
And do you see that this.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.540
This is my Aquaphor.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.340
I cannot go anywhere without it.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.320
I have this, like,

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:44.061
big thing of Aquaphor,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.500
and, like, once a month, maybe I just, like,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.500
squeeze them in here, right,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.960
and I refill it.

00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:52.681
You can be more precise.

00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:54.661
I don't care enough to. Um,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.440
this. Like, I, I,

00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:58.201
I have a big phone, and I can't,

00:00:58.202 --> 00:01:00.021
I just can't use my phone without a pop socket.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.900
Um, and this, like,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.700
life changer. Um,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.560
that's why I have my listening angel on here.

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:08.081
And I'm Bulgarian,

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:09.841
and every New Year, we have this, like,

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:11.081
little bread that we break,

00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:11.961
and we have, like,

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:12.721
little, like,

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:13.201
messages. What,

00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:16.481
what the New Year will give to us was, like, health, wealth,

00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:17.401
luck, travel,

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:18.641
whatever. And I Got luck.

00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:19.881
And I was keeping my phone.

00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:20.401
Um, also,

00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:23.121
this is all the super glue to get the kids on. Anyways,

00:01:23.122 --> 00:01:23.561
not important.

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:25.961
Point is life changer.

00:01:25.962 --> 00:01:29.801
I cannot recommend enough. How much I love, like,

00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:30.901
this little thing.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.800
Since discovering it,

00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.121
I have not had a phone without it.

00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:34.801
Um, so, yeah,

00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:35.533
you're welcome.
