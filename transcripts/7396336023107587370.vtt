00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
I have another thought about Ballerina Farm. Again,

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.201
I haven't been able to access the whole article,

00:00:04.202 --> 00:00:06.761
but I have now at least seen a good chunks of,

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:08.001
like, the actual text.

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.521
And it doesn't escape me that this man took a woman

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:16.281
and molded her into the type of woman he thought he wanted.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.661
He didn't choose a woman who wanted these things for herself.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.320
He chose a woman who was ambitious,

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.921
who was talented, who went to Juilliard.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.521
Do you know how hard it is to get into Juilliard?

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:28.641
She had these dreams of being this prima ballerina in New York City,

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:32.841
and she has now eight children deep on a farm with a bunch of cows.

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:34.961
And although she's wildly successful at this trad

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:36.401
wife influencing stuff,

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:38.641
this is not the life that she had dreamed for herself.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.561
And now I understand that dreams change,

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:44.041
but this very much seems to be his dream come to life.

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:46.461
And he could have plugged in any woman for it.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.320
But he chose a woman who didn't grow up wanting this.

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:50.561
Which just goes to show

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:53.721
that these men want to play king of their own castle.

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:55.041
And as much as he wants a queen,

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:58.101
he wants to keep her locked in a tower of his own making.
