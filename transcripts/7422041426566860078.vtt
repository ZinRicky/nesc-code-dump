00:00.040 --> 00:02.320
We just landed after a 10 hour flight

00:02.321 --> 00:05.441
and the first thing my husband requests is a hot dog.

00:05.442 --> 00:09.481
So instead of running to the store I just decided to make it myself.

00:09.482 --> 00:12.961
I started by cutting up some pork and placing that in the freezer

00:12.962 --> 00:15.421
while I got started on my hot dog buns.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.840
Combine some yeast, sugar,

00:16.841 --> 00:18.281
and milk. Let that bloom

00:18.282 --> 00:21.761
while I started on mixing all of my dry ingredients together.

00:21.762 --> 00:25.321
I added some melted butter before combining my wet and dry

00:25.322 --> 00:29.001
and adding an egg. I gave that a good mix and once it came together

00:29.002 --> 00:32.881
I covered it for five minutes before turning it out and kneading it.

00:32.882 --> 00:37.281
I then placed my dough into a bowl and let that rise for 45 minutes.

00:37.282 --> 00:40.361
In the meantime, I got started on making some mustard.

00:40.362 --> 00:42.721
My husband doesn't have ketchup on his hot dog,

00:42.722 --> 00:44.801
so I just made some mustard for him.

00:44.802 --> 00:45.921
I took it off the stove,

00:45.922 --> 00:49.641
I set that aside to cool and diced up some onion as a topping.

00:49.642 --> 00:52.941
He doesn't care for relish so this makes it a lot easier.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.120
For 45 minutes

00:54.121 --> 00:57.841
I punched down my dough and form it into little hot dog shaped buns

00:57.842 --> 00:59.761
before brushing them with some egg wash

00:59.762 --> 01:02.221
and baking them for about 15 minutes.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.360
While those were cooling, I got started on my sausage.

01:05.361 --> 01:07.761
His favourite sausages are German ones,

01:07.762 --> 01:11.321
so I opted for that instead of the classic hot dog sausage.

01:11.322 --> 01:12.761
Once my meat Was ground up.

01:12.762 --> 01:14.821
I got started on all my spices.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.880
Pour those into my meat

01:16.881 --> 01:20.201
before letting that combine for about three to four minutes.

01:20.202 --> 01:20.921
In the meantime,

01:20.922 --> 01:24.861
I washed my casing and let it soak for about 30 minutes.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.760
For stuffing that with my meat and twisting it into little links.

01:28.761 --> 01:30.741
I worked on this in batches.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.960
Poach them for about three to four minutes,

01:32.961 --> 01:35.601
fried them off, and then it was time to assemble.

01:35.602 --> 01:37.441
I put my bun and sausage down,

01:37.442 --> 01:39.963
topped it with my condiments, and he loved it.
