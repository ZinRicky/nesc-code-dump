00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.620
custom by Fat Fab Feminist

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.160
so I was wrong

00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:05.161
um okay

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:07.921
I made a video about these glosses and how I really didn't like them

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:08.561
and to be fair

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:10.041
I really didn't like them when I first started

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.681
the problem is this is a really

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:12.981
really thick gloss

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.800
and for some reason

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:15.921
the way this applicator works um

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:19.401
it just does not pick up the amount of gloss that I need to have

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:20.801
like a super saturated lip right

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:22.361
like when it's on

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:23.881
it feels thick and it feels nice

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:25.441
it does I really like the way it feels

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:31.401
um and I've been wearing this with my Palladio lip stain because this combo

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:32.321
awesome amazing

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:33.481
love it um

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:34.121
however this

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:35.441
I just like the color

00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:37.361
not for me never use this

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:41.281
um so I am going to change the color

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:42.161
I'm gonna try and change the color

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:43.781
I don't actually know if this is gonna work

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.600
um but I've seen Daus Mendoza actually make a clear gloss into a different color

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:49.441
so I'm like okay

00:00:49.442 --> 00:00:51.641
if you can take a clear gloss um

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:53.041
and make it into a different color

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:54.741
then I'm assuming

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.320
I'm assuming if I add color to this

00:00:57.321 --> 00:00:58.541
should I try to take this off

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.040
maybe I should try to take it off

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:03.041
but I'm assuming if I add a color to this

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:04.521
it will also change

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:07.261
I'm taking this old morphe palette that I don't really use

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.320
and I think I'm gonna go in oh

00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:12.001
I think I'm gonna go in with some red

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:13.061
these are probably blue

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.460
and make it more usable

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.400
this this and this color

00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:20.261
let's see let's see what the vibe is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.440
is this bad just like

00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:22.781
tapping it in maybe

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.240
imagine this doesn't work and I just like

00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.301
ruin lip gloss

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.740
okay so

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.760
but I would feel bad ruining

00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:34.021
I don't I don't like wasting things

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.900
um I grew up like

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.080
with a family who was poor

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:39.301
like I didn't grow up poor

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.420
very privileged to have grown up with everything I ever needed

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.280
but my parents are both immigrants and they grew up poor

00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:47.361
so they had that like

00:01:47.362 --> 00:01:49.221
mentality of poverty basically

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.640
um and so they grew up the way that I grew up

00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:55.641
like they kind of still have that mindset

00:01:55.642 --> 00:01:57.321
so even though like

00:01:57.322 --> 00:01:58.941
we were financially secure

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.760
um my dad did not like

00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:03.481
get the memo um

00:02:03.482 --> 00:02:04.161
so I just like

00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:05.621
we didn't throw things away

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.060
like not hoarders obviously

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.480
however hoarder tendencies

00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:12.561
I will say so

00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:14.421
I don't know why I'm telling all this to the internet

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.500
girl just make your video

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.100
something is happening

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.660
I don't know if it's something that I want to be happening

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.400
wait

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.020
so I can't I can't go to the bottom

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.600
so everything else is changing color

00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:33.541
but this isn't

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.580
also I don't know what color I'm going for

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.900
I just want something that's more usable on my lips

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.920
we should have done a swatch beforehand

00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:41.841
but you know what

00:02:41.842 --> 00:02:43.581
you can tell that color is not gonna work on me

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.180
sorry for ruining your lip gloss R.E.M beauty

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.980
oh

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.340
see one swipe of this is just not enough

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.500
because it's like

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.060
there isn't enough of a slip for it to like be smooth

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.160
hmm

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.300
but when I pack it on

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.520
oh

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.320
I'm a genius I'm literally a genius

00:03:21.321 --> 00:03:22.781
I'm literally a genius

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.280
do I  wanna add more

00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:26.901
the thing is I also have too much gene

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.100
and I'm like maybe I could add more

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.720
I think i’m gonna add more

00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:38.921
is it like a mad scientist

00:03:38.922 --> 00:03:41.841
like scraping and mixing and scraping and mixing and

00:03:41.842 --> 00:03:42.841
like customizing

00:03:42.842 --> 00:03:43.921
get me in the makeup lab

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:45.721
actually that's what you need to do

00:03:45.722 --> 00:03:47.161
get me in the lab

00:03:47.162 --> 00:03:48.761
I can do it look at this custom color

00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:51.021
do you think it'll work should I do that way

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.000
mix mix

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:55.201
mix mix mix mix mix

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:55.881
mix mix

00:03:55.882 --> 00:03:59.761
honestly this is a little bit similar to my favorite gloss of the moment

00:03:59.762 --> 00:04:02.141
which is the Tower 28 Milky Jelly

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.680
um it's got a little purple

00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:05.661
which is cute

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.860
but I think I want more red

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.180
sorry absolutely destroying this palette

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.700
I'm Stan and I was wrong

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.180
I singing the Stan’s wrong song

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.300
I was playing that in my head the entire time I was

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.020
getting ready to make this video 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.020
I just like it

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.760
also it's like

00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:29.641
so cool you can just like

00:04:29.642 --> 00:04:30.701
make your own shit

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.120
you can just customize anything you want

00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:33.601
there's no rules

00:04:33.602 --> 00:04:34.741
isn't that awesome

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.280
isn’t it awesome

00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:36.761
that you can just like

00:04:36.762 --> 00:04:37.941
do whatever you want

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.740
like no one's being harmed in this video

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.340
I'm sure there's gonna be people who are like

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.840
why would you destroy lip gloss

00:04:44.841 --> 00:04:45.781
I'm sorry

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.580
I'm not British

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.240
I'm from Staten Island though

00:04:50.241 --> 00:04:51.381
unfortunately

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.140
and I feel like there are definitely Staten Island girls who

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.000
at least at a period of time

00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:58.621
really liked concealer lips

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.140
no shade or hate to Staten Island girls

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.580
but otherwise

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.470
I don't know 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.240
actually you know what

00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:08.181
another demographic uses that color

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.780
I think women who do like um

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.200
like brown lip liner and like a light light

00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:16.921
like middle also use that lip color

00:05:16.922 --> 00:05:18.381
I'm just not one of them

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.600
like I'll do a brown lip

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:21.521
I'm just yapping

00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:22.161
I'll just do like

00:05:22.162 --> 00:05:23.381
a brown lip liner

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.180
and then I like a little red or pinky in the middle

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.720
but it needs to have some color goodness

00:05:29.721 --> 00:05:31.561
Gracian yes okay

00:05:31.562 --> 00:05:32.801
Joey Graceffa what is wrong with me

00:05:32.802 --> 00:05:34.741
I don't know I'm just like yapping okay

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.260
guys I think this is a awesome colour

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.680
pretty and then people will be like

00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:46.281
oh my god what lip gloss are you wearing

00:05:46.282 --> 00:05:47.601
sorry custom

00:05:47.602 --> 00:05:48.521
my bad guys

00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:49.421
I'm just like

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.760
what am I saying

00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:55.741
the way that I've been doing this for 10 minutes

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.460
and I was literally cut off mid yap

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.520
but tell me tell me it's not worth it

00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:03.621
tell me this is not the most perfect color

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.940
oh my god oh I'm so happy

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.876
I kinda love this

00:06:10.877 --> 00:06:11.201
 again

00:06:11.202 --> 00:06:13.601
this gloss is best when you like

00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:16.061
pack it on uh

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.100
in my opinion

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.040
and it is really thick

00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:20.601
so if you don't like a thick glosses

00:06:20.602 --> 00:06:21.201
don't use this

00:06:21.202 --> 00:06:22.141
don't buy this

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.420
don't get mad at me

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.060
I would definitely wear a liner with this

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.760
oh god

00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:31.881
that was so fun

00:06:31.882 --> 00:06:33.221
okay done

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.500
this is the aftermath

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.260
okay

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.920
this is the aftermath of the palette

00:06:40.921 --> 00:06:43.881
it's still honestly usable if I needed to use it

00:06:43.882 --> 00:06:44.861
I just like

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.780
I haven't done anything fun with makeup in a while

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.360
and then my friend Madison just gave me all this like

00:06:48.361 --> 00:06:49.341
makeup products

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.080
and I've been playing with makeup so much more now

00:06:52.081 --> 00:06:52.881
I again

00:06:52.882 --> 00:06:55.281
I don't know how this is going to last

00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:57.121
I don't know if like

00:06:57.122 --> 00:06:57.881
this is you know

00:06:57.882 --> 00:06:58.961
a problem for the pigment

00:06:58.962 --> 00:06:59.481
I I

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:00.721
don't quote me

00:07:00.722 --> 00:07:02.381
I don't know anything

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.460
this is you know as much as I do but I think

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.600
awesome color

00:07:09.601 --> 00:07:10.881
I'm so happy perfect

00:07:10.882 --> 00:07:11.701
okay cute

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.220
now that we're here

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.440
do I ruin this one too

00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:15.601
no but this one's not ruined

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:16.621
I really like this

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.240
maybe just like

00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:18.101
a little bit of red

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.200
maybe just like a little bit of red

00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:20.081
maybe just like a little bit of red

00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:21.421
maybe just like a little bit of red

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.380
because it is a little light for me

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.480
too much gene

00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:26.421
too much gene

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.060
don't say anything

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.040
I don't wanna hear

00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:32.201
I don't wanna hear it

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:33.601
I've also used a lot of this
