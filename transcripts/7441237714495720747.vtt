00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.960
I was diagnosed with a condition called POTS

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:03.921
when I was just 15 years old,

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:07.721
and it's been 10 years of trying to figure out what works best for me.

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.681
My body just does not retain water very well,

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:14.281
and that's why it's so important to have a good electrolyte drink

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:18.241
to drink through the day for my body to help retain fluid.

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:20.321
Salty is a really great option for this.

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:24.121
I really want to remain active even with my condition,

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:25.801
and have tried to do so

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:29.381
by playing volleyball and pickleball throughout the years.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.400
I still want to be active in my daily life

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:34.201
no matter what my condition is,

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:37.041
and that's why having a good electrolyte drink is so important to me.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:40.041
The other thing I love about salty is that it is paleo,

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:41.121
vegan, and keto.

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:43.321
It tastes so good. Thank you, salty,

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:45.461
for helping me stay active.
