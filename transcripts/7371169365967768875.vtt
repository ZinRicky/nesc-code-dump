00:00.040 --> 00:01.400
My kids aren't big snackers,

00:01.401 --> 00:03.521
but today they requested some cheeses

00:03.522 --> 00:05.441
after seeing them at the store the other day,

00:05.442 --> 00:08.141
so I decided to just make them some.

00:08.160 --> 00:10.320
These are super simple and quick to make,

00:10.321 --> 00:13.001
so I started off by shredding some cheddar cheese,

00:13.002 --> 00:16.001
combining that in my stand mixer with some salt and butter.

00:16.002 --> 00:18.761
Then mix mix it all until it's pretty much combined

00:18.762 --> 00:22.621
before adding in some flour and some really cold water.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.240
Once that all comes together,

00:24.241 --> 00:27.681
I into a disc and spread it on some plastic wrap

00:27.682 --> 00:30.801
before popping it in the fridge for about an hour and a half.

00:30.802 --> 00:33.361
After it's chilled I pull it back out.

00:33.362 --> 00:34.681
Usually I cut it in half

00:34.682 --> 00:37.681
so it's easier to handle for using my rolling pin

00:37.682 --> 00:39.441
to get it as thin as I can,

00:39.442 --> 00:41.601
and then slice in whatever shape I want.

00:41.602 --> 00:44.541
Usually it's tiny rectangles or squares.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.840
Place those on a Parchment line baking tray

00:46.841 --> 00:50.881
before using the end of a chopstick to put a small hole in the middle

00:50.882 --> 00:52.481
so they resemble Cheez its.

00:52.482 --> 00:54.201
After I've done that with all of them,

00:54.202 --> 00:56.721
I pop them in the oven for about 10 minutes,

00:56.722 --> 00:59.401
let them cool, and then place them in my glass jar.

00:59.402 --> 01:00.761
That's how I usually store them,

01:00.762 --> 01:03.381
but my kids had all of these in one sitting.
