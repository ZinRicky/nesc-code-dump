00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.500
going to explain the Comstock Act

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.560
why Republicans want to revive it

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:07.961
and how it could diminish abortion access in the United States

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:09.841
so this is Anthony Comstock

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:12.961
he was known for being a village nuisance and a chronic casterbatur

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:14.121
in the late 1800s

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:17.301
Comstock became obsessed with being the morality police

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.400
he was against anything and everything that he viewed as being immoral

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.081
because he thought these immoralities were poisoning society

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:24.401
so he was against gambling

00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:25.201
prostitution

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:26.821
birth control abortion

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.560
anything seggsually explicit

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.301
even nude art

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.840
no I'm digressing here a little bit

00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:32.641
but like the people

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:36.241
even in the 1800s were just dragging Anthony Comstock

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:38.881
so like we got these unreal comics of him

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:40.101
so here he is

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.360
um being offended by mannequins

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:44.841
and here he's chasing a neked cat

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:46.201
see how the other cat has clothes on

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:48.201
and here the top right is my favorite

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:48.721
they're like

00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:51.141
joking about how he probably bathes with his clothes on

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.960
eventually this weirdo goes to Congress

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:56.641
and explains that all of these immoralities are poisoning American society

00:00:56.642 --> 00:00:58.081
and that he has an idea to stop it

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.761
that we should start monitoring materials

00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:01.781
that are going through the US Postal Service

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.080
The Comstock Act was born

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:04.721
which banned certain materials

00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:07.761
obscene materials passing through the US Postal Service

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:11.161
that are intended for the prevention of conceptions

00:01:11.162 --> 00:01:14.101
like birth control or procuring of abortion

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.800
somehow gets Congress to agree to make him a special agent of the Postal Service

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:20.401
with police level powers

00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:22.001
including the right to a weapon

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:25.401
so he starts going around personally inspecting the mail

00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:28.841
he personally seized and destroyed 15 tons of books

00:01:28.842 --> 00:01:30.521
4 million pictures

00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:33.421
and claimed that books are feeders for brothels

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.000
one of his victims was idecratic

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.521
who ended up unaliving herself before being sent to federal prison

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:40.601
and and her on a living note

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:42.721
specifically condemned Comstock

00:01:42.722 --> 00:01:45.041
do you think it's bad for somebody to blame you and their

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:46.781
on a living note oh no

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.480
of his 4,000 arrests

00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:52.701
14 other people said that he specifically drove them to doing that

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.640
naturally 150 years later

00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:57.161
Republicans would like to revive this man's work

00:01:57.162 --> 00:01:59.601
thing is that the Comstock Act is still a law

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:01.441
it was never explicitly repealed

00:02:01.442 --> 00:02:03.361
it's just over the last 150 years

00:02:03.362 --> 00:02:06.261
it kind of just went into oblivion and became obsolete

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.440
as it should until now

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:12.041
Republicans wanna bring back the enforcement of the construct act

00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:12.841
because they're saying

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:16.721
we already have a law in the books that prohibits mailing of abortion pills

00:02:16.722 --> 00:02:17.721
beauty of this for them

00:02:17.722 --> 00:02:21.521
is that they don't need to get the votes and Congress to pass a law this crazy

00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:23.121
it's already on the books

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:23.761
they would need

00:02:23.762 --> 00:02:25.081
as a Republican president

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:26.481
who would lead an administration

00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:28.121
namely the department of justice

00:02:28.122 --> 00:02:31.181
that would be amenable and open to enforcing this act

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.640
already making these arguments

00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:33.921
so in the mifipristone case

00:02:33.922 --> 00:02:35.861
coming for the Supreme Court this term

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.480
anti choice activists are already making arguments

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:42.481
that mailing mifipristone in the mail violates the Comstock Act

00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:43.241
upheld in court

00:02:43.242 --> 00:02:45.561
it would not only outlaw medication abortion

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:47.661
which is the most common form of abortion

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.120
so hoping to use it to stop surgical abortions

00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:51.681
by pointing to language in the act

00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:54.001
saying that it bans any article or thing designed

00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:56.201
adapted or intended for producing abortion

00:02:56.202 --> 00:02:59.521
so they're trying to say that you also can't mail any medical equipment

00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:01.861
that would be used to procure an abortion

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.680
far from a slam dunk

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:05.321
as you're probably anticipating

00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:10.101
there are so many legal hurdles with trying to enforce a law like this

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.480
for now I'm gonna pause

00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:13.281
if you want me to talk about those legal hurdles

00:03:13.282 --> 00:03:14.401
let me know in the comments

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.117
and let me know what you think
