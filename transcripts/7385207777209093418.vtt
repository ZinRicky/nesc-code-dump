00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.540
you do realize that if you are smaller than extra small

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.360
you can still fit into the extra small

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:10.480
like it might be a little bit loose on you

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:13.940
slightly unflattering but it's not the same thing

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.120
has been larger than the largest size

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:19.480
if you can't fit into an XL or XXL (in typical straight size retailers)

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:20.720
whatever you're done

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.720
like you physically could not get the item of clothing onto your body

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:25.800
there's no amount of like

00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:27.840
altering that's gonna make it fit you

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:29.260
if it doesn't fit you doesn't fit you

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.400
that is like in no way shape or form the same thing as like

00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:36.360
skinny people not being able to fit into a size xs

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.120
an item of clothing being too baggy for you

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.960
is not the same as it not literally being able to go over your body

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:44.960
67% of women in the United States or more are plus size

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:45.800
if I'm not mistaken

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:50.260
roughly like 19% of the fashion industry caters to plus size women

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.280
do you do you see

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:53.320
I don't I know math might be hard

00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:56.400
but I'm gonna trust your ability to understand that there's an issue there

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:59.960
I don't know why people are on Twitter arguing with me about this before 9:00am

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.700
I'm going back to bed and I pray that when I wake up

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.982
y'all have developed a little bit of common sense thank you
