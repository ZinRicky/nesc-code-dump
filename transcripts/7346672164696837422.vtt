If you're afraid to have a baby,

00:01.360 --> 00:02.320
watch this video.

00:02.320 --> 00:04.880
We just got in and out wearing cute little outfits.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.800
She just. Can we please get more content like this?

00:07.800 --> 00:11.080
There's so much negativity out there about motherhood and about babies

00:11.080 --> 00:12.060
and about children,

00:12.320 --> 00:12.680
and, like,

00:12.680 --> 00:13.400
we all get it.

00:13.400 --> 00:14.280
All moms get it.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.440
We know how hard it is.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.860
We know it's difficult,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.080
but it's also so much freaking fun.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.120
Like, it's so fun

00:20.120 --> 00:22.280
to hang out with these little people that run around your house

00:22.280 --> 00:23.760
and to do things with them.

00:23.760 --> 00:24.900
It is the best.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.440
And I often speak to moms

00:26.440 --> 00:28.160
who are struggling with postpartum depression,

00:28.160 --> 00:29.040
and I work with them,

00:29.040 --> 00:33.080
and one of the biggest things that help is seeing moms like this one

00:33.080 --> 00:35.820
who let themselves enjoy being a mom

00:36.280 --> 00:40.120
and seeing women who shed light on the positives of being a mom

00:40.120 --> 00:41.520
and how amazing it is

00:41.520 --> 00:44.900
and how parenthood is literally the best thing they've ever done.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.280
Women know how difficult it is to be a mom,

00:47.280 --> 00:51.480
but being able to be reminded of how amazing it is and how fun it is

00:51.480 --> 00:52.640
is so important.

00:52.640 --> 00:53.971
I love content like this.
