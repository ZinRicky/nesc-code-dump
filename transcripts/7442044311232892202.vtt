00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.400
An accusation commonly thrown at trap lives online

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:03.721
is that because they make money,

00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:05.961
or a small amount of money in this case online,

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:07.961
then therefore they are truly not traditional

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:09.281
and they are just cosplaying

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:11.521
being traditional. People like Anna here comment these things

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:13.641
because they hear other creators on other platforms

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:14.601
parrot these talking points

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:16.481
that are just not true. Cause most people are taught,

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:17.601
especially women are taught

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:19.561
that women have always been borrowed from the workforce

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:21.321
because feminism has been such a great thing.

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.241
Women can now work.

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:24.961
But women have historically always worked in some form.

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:27.281
Now I'm not saying it's always been sunshine and roses for women

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:28.881
in history, cause we know that's not true.

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:31.681
Women used to be borders, they used to run out properties,

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:33.921
be drink workers, selling things at market.

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:35.601
And other skilled crafts like sewing.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.601
Really earning an income from home or even outside the home

00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:40.081
is in line with traditional values.

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:41.281
The main difference today, however,

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:43.081
is that work is no longer centered around the home,

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:44.681
which thanks to the Industrial Revolution,

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:47.081
has caused a plethora of problems for both men and women.

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:48.681
The big part of the traditional movement

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.481
is re centering our focus on the home,

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:51.921
the main priority in our life.

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:54.721
And creating productive households that generated income

00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:55.565
is part of that.
