00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.840
These markers from the TikTok shop.

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:06.241
They are paint markers. My kids have spent their day,

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:07.941
they painted all these little rocks.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.200
Look at this rock that they painted paper.

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:14.621
Right now he's decorating a pumpkin.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.920
And they're amazing. It was.

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:20.861
And you get a 24 pack,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.120
48 colors because all of them are dual sided,

00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:27.381
so everyone has like two colors.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.320
These are amazing. They're acrylic paint,

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:34.621
water based, quick dry,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.540
safe to use,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.580
and keep even an eight year old little boy calm and sitting down.
