00:00.080 --> 00:02.560
My toddler stumbled into my room this morning

00:02.561 --> 00:04.681
asking for cereal for breakfast.

00:04.682 --> 00:08.221
He saw someone eating Fruit Loops and wanted those specifically,

00:08.320 --> 00:10.700
so I caved and just made her some.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.200
Started by combining some almond flour,

00:13.201 --> 00:14.961
maple syrup, coconut oil,

00:14.962 --> 00:17.721
and some tapioca flour giving that a good mix.

00:17.722 --> 00:18.761
Setting that aside

00:18.762 --> 00:22.381
and then got started on grinding up all of my dried fruit,

00:22.400 --> 00:24.800
I decided on a mango banana flavor,

00:24.801 --> 00:29.301
raspberry flavor, and also blueberry since that's her favorite fruit.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.680
My cereal dough into each bowl

00:31.681 --> 00:35.401
added a little bit more flour and gave that a really good mix.

00:35.402 --> 00:36.721
Once it all came together,

00:36.722 --> 00:40.881
I started forming my little cereal by getting a small amount of dough,

00:40.882 --> 00:45.001
rolling it out, and placing it on a Parchment paper lined baking sheet.

00:45.002 --> 00:49.481
While I was doing that, I also preheated my oven to about 350 degrees,

00:49.482 --> 00:51.201
and once that was ready,

00:51.202 --> 00:54.921
I smashed down my cereal and added a little hole in the middle.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.761
Before baking them for about eight to 10 minutes,

00:57.762 --> 00:59.441
I let them cool completely,

00:59.442 --> 01:00.601
topped them with some milk,

01:00.602 --> 01:02.626
and she absolutely loved them.
