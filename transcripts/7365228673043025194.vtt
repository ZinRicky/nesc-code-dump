00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Baking is something I'm really bad at.

00:02.001 --> 00:03.601
It's a massive science experiment

00:03.602 --> 00:06.841
that you have to get just right in order to get the right result.

00:06.842 --> 00:08.681
And for me, that's always a hit or miss.

00:08.682 --> 00:11.561
But I really want to learn how to make sourdough bread.

00:11.562 --> 00:13.361
So when my sister flew in,

00:13.362 --> 00:15.761
that was the first thing I wanted her to teach me

00:15.762 --> 00:17.901
how to make a good sourdough loaf.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.440
We got our starter and started feeding it,

00:20.441 --> 00:21.761
and once it was ready,

00:21.762 --> 00:24.641
we made two loafs of sourdough bread.

00:24.642 --> 00:25.481
One thing I didn't know

00:25.482 --> 00:28.241
is how long it would take to do the stretch and folds,

00:28.242 --> 00:30.801
and how it would take up our entire day,

00:30.802 --> 00:33.761
coming back to our dough every hour to stretch it.

00:33.762 --> 00:35.841
But after about four to five hours,

00:35.842 --> 00:39.281
we were all done with the stretch and folds and turned our dough out,

00:39.282 --> 00:40.281
split it into,

00:40.282 --> 00:43.681
and decided on what flavors we wanted the loafs to be.

00:43.682 --> 00:45.561
We wanted a savory and a sweet one.

00:45.562 --> 00:46.601
So for the savory,

00:46.602 --> 00:49.161
we opted for a Parmesan lemon loaf.

00:49.162 --> 00:51.121
And I was craving blueberries so bad,

00:51.122 --> 00:54.281
so we decided to also make a lemon blueberry loaf.

00:54.282 --> 00:56.921
We sprinkle that one with a little bit of brown sugar,

00:56.922 --> 00:59.001
and then started forming it into a loaf

00:59.002 --> 01:01.041
by creating some tension in the dough.

01:01.042 --> 01:05.041
Pop that in the fridge for a little over 12 hours before scoring it

01:05.042 --> 01:08.281
and placing it in our Dutch oven with some ice cubes.

01:08.282 --> 01:10.821
Baked it And it came out so perfect.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.600
Needed a butter,

01:11.601 --> 01:14.521
so we made a whipped brown, vanilla and maple butter,

01:14.522 --> 01:17.641
which went perfectly with how tart the blueberries were.

01:17.642 --> 01:21.001
Our savory loaf was proofing in the fridge for about 48 hours,

01:21.002 --> 01:22.281
so after two days,

01:22.282 --> 01:23.661
it was ready to bake.
