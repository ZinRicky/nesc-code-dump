When my husband turned to me this morning

00:02.201 --> 00:04.441
and said he was craving steak and fries,

00:04.442 --> 00:06.481
I knew exactly where to take him,

00:06.482 --> 00:10.561
since this little restaurant in Paris only serves those two things.

00:10.562 --> 00:13.681
Luckily, it was only a 15 minute walk from our hotel,

00:13.682 --> 00:16.901
and the line in front of the restaurant moved pretty quickly.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.680
There was no food menu, since they only served steak and fries.

00:20.681 --> 00:24.281
They immediately brought us out this mustardy green salad.

00:24.282 --> 00:26.761
They asked us how we wanted our steak cooked.

00:26.762 --> 00:29.441
About 10 minutes later, it was served.

00:29.442 --> 00:31.241
Place actually surprised me.

00:31.242 --> 00:33.161
I didn't think it was gonna be good,

00:33.162 --> 00:36.121
and even though it needed a little bit of salt,

00:36.122 --> 00:39.161
the sauce was amazing. Not only with the fries and the meat,

00:39.162 --> 00:42.081
but also the bread. After the first two rounds of steak,

00:42.082 --> 00:43.921
they said that's all they served,

00:43.922 --> 00:47.921
so we had to order another portion since lucky was really hungry still.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.481
But at this point, I was stuffed.

00:49.482 --> 00:53.161
So he finished off my steak and fries before he tapped out.

00:53.162 --> 00:55.761
And after he paid, we needed something sweet,

00:55.762 --> 00:57.681
so we found this little crepe stand.

00:57.682 --> 01:00.441
I obviously got the crepe with lemon and sugar

01:00.442 --> 01:02.092
before we headed back to the hotel.
