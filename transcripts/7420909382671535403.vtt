00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
Here's a morning in my life as a blue collar Chadwick.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.800
My husband went to work super early this morning for a meeting,

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.361
and so I didn't get up with him

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:09.441
because he has been getting over pneumonia recently

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.061
and did not have an appetite for me to make him breakfast.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.520
It's been really rainy here for the last week or so,

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:16.161
so I'm ready for some sunshine.

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:19.181
Plus, I would really like to get my garden taken care of for fall,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.560
but I do really love the cold that it is bringing with it.

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.881
Make a hot cup of coffee, and then I get dressed for the day.

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:26.841
I really wanted to share this dress with you guys.

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.821
It is from the Skirt Lady boutique.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.200
Not only is it modest and really comfortable,

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:35.301
but this is customizable. So I got short sleeves in a midi length.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.240
It has pockets, and it's nursing friendly.

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:39.401
Our mornings are spent doing cataclysm

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:41.081
and just cuddling and hanging out.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.841
Sometimes I'll have structured activities for her,

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.041
but today we just didn't.

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:47.041
I also usually do red light therapy and read a little bit.

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.241
I'm currently working through holiness by JC Rile.

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:51.681
And then it's time to get to work doing my morning chores.

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:53.701
When I put the apron on, it is serious.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.640
First off, I have so much laundry to do from having house guests.

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:57.721
It's just kind of been backed up.

00:00:57.722 --> 00:00:59.201
I haven't really been keeping up with it.

00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:00.921
I also recently Thrifted a lot of fun blankets,

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:02.761
so I've been washing those over the weekend.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.841
I did end up buying half a bushel that I then processed into cider.

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:08.361
I am now making apple crisp because I'm out of canning jars,

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:09.961
and I do not have the budget at the moment

00:01:09.962 --> 00:01:11.401
to go and buy more canning jars.

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:13.481
So these are just gonna go into our deep freezer.

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:15.641
This whole process took me straight up to lunch,

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.143
and then my morning for the day was done.
