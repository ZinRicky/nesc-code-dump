00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.680
Alana

00:00:00.681 --> 00:00:03.840
do you feel bad knowing that children will bear the brand of climate change

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.920
I totally do see why this is so funny

00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:09.440
but also I have like some very serious and real points to make about this

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:13.840
because I had this conversation the other day and it was really annoying

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:15.040
and I won the debate

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:19.000
and I wanna tell you some of the things I said because inevitably

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.600
like this is I know that this is conversation that other people will be having

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:26.160
not just me I was like drinking

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.900
having nice girls night with some girls who like late 30s

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.320
not having kids like decide not to have kids

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:33.600
um which is awesome

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.680
and like they

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:41.660
I told them like I wanted to have like a baby and they were really critical

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.840
and they were saying like

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:44.340
why would you bring a baby into this world

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.860
climate change

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.200
like the world is burning

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:52.400
none of which I disagree with in terms of the world burning

00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:54.000
but it didn't change my mind

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:55.160
and I was like well

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:56.120
you know what women

00:00:56.121 --> 00:01:00.280
like again our reproductive systems are becoming political

00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:03.000
like our bodies are political playgrounds

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:07.940
we know that we are still somehow in 2024 fighting for like abortion rights

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.980
like rights to choose

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.680
rights to access basic healthcare has been practiced for a very long time

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.560
the abortion one is just like such an easy one to point to

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:19.160
but there is like

00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:23.640
so many different ways that our bodies are political playgrounds

00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:27.720
and our reproductive systems and our reproductive potential is just like

00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:28.800
constantly common question

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:30.280
we can't win with her like a single mum

00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:31.960
we can't win with her don't have babies

00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:33.940
can't win with her do have babies

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.340
can't mother properly just like

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.240
just like a never ending like set of judgement

00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:42.460
climate crisis

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.060
let's point to the women to solve it

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.560
did you know that

00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:48.920
having a baby is the worst possible thing you can do for the world

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:52.860
in terms of like you can like become a vegan and you can recycle all you want

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.320
and you can like ride your bike everywhere

00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:56.080
but if you have a baby undoes all that

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:58.620
are men getting that type of judgement

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.600
you know what it doesn't matter because maybe they are

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:03.440
and this what I'll say

00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:07.920
that women are the ones who are socialized and conditioned from birth

00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:10.580
to give birth they are told a whole life

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.360
you will find fulfillment

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:16.660
you will be a real woman if you have a baby and re

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.960
and fulfill your reproductive potential

00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:21.720
that will be the most amazing thing that you ever achieve in your life

00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:24.880
it is drilled into us it is drilled into us right

00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:27.900
and we are told to accept that reality whether or not we want to

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.040
both things being valid whether or not we want to

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:36.280
that is it and like we are criticized if we choose a different path right

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:40.540
we are you cannot argue we are conditioned we are told

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.140
we are told in multiple ways from our families

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.500
from the media from politics

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.920
from friends that societies

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:52.480
everything

00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:58.160
we're told this is what you'll do and it'll be great and you'll be a woman

00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:01.680
it'll be amazing and if you don't do it has to be this whole thing

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.400
why I'm not doing it then the climate crisis happens

00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:06.000
and then we're told oh

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:07.760
my God if you have a baby

00:03:07.761 --> 00:03:11.800
you are the most selfish woman for having a baby

00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.720
that men are not told the same message like

00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:16.200
so yes

00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:18.400
we might criticize men as well for starting a family now

00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:23.360
but they are not the ones who will suffer as much at the hands of the criticism

00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:26.200
just the way that they don't suffer as much um

00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:30.640
when they are single dads or just dads

00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:32.640
they get a lot more kudos for a lot less

00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:34.760
so why are we now turning around climate crisis

00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:37.500
let's look at women's bodies to solve the climate crisis

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.600
I think not I don't think we should do that

00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:42.400
I don't think we should go down that route

00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:43.400
because at the end of the day

00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:45.960
it's just another way of controlling women

00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:51.520
and putting the owners on women to solve a problem that men started

00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:53.980
and created the climate crisis

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.380
men created the wars

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.580
so why should I deny myself and my body the one thing I've always wanted to do

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.320
whether or not I know that I wanna do it

00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:06.640
because I've been so socially conditioned into thinking I wanna do it

00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:09.460
I don't even know but what I do know is that I want it

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.420
and why should I not to get to have that one thing I want

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.400
because of all these problems men started

00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:17.480
cause that sounds to me like victim blaming

00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:18.600
and that's what I think about that

00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:21.160
what do you think so it's like in part of the world

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:23.880
women can't choose like in parts of America

00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:24.520
women countries

00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:27.200
in a lot of countries in a lot of cultures

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:31.160
women cannot choose discount for a lot of the struggle and the pain that women

00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:32.280
who are forced to give birth

00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:34.800
and forced to have babies also go through

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:38.120
like it acts as if we live in that world

00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:39.080
we don't live in that world

00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:43.500
like we don't live in a world where

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.680
this is not still a contentious issue

00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:53.800
where some women are forced to give birth and for variety reasons

00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:55.760
assault abortion laws

00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:59.160
contraceptive access resources to information education

00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:01.680
we don't live in a world where that's more still an ongoing problem

00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:03.360
and maybe when we live in that world

00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:04.580
let's have that conversation

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.820
we live in a world where birth and babies is very much still

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.300
something that happens to women

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.520
not for women and then people wanna turn around and be like

00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.460
well judgemental about why I'm having one

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.300
men are already judged and forced and coerced into doing it

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.200
and now we're also being the same into not doing it for different reasons

00:05:28.201 --> 00:05:29.040
then people say well

00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:30.400
like you wanna give birth

00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:32.680
but you're talking about like all the women in the world who like

00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.360
can't choose to give birth

00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:34.840
and like

00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:39.000
how becoming a mother and all that social conditioning is like patriarchal

00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:40.500
but then you wanna go and do it

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.200
you're missing the whole point

00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:44.160
okay let listen

00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:50.100
this is why we have been giving birth before the patriarchy ever existed

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.340
it is something we have been doing for literally ever

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.820
obviously men

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.120
the patriarchy did not invent giving birth

00:05:58.121 --> 00:05:59.280
they wanna control it

00:05:59.281 --> 00:06:03.640
cause it's the one thing that we have that we do that they don't get to

00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:05.000
what they try to control obviously

00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:06.340
but they we do it

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.480
they wanna control how we do it

00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:08.800
they wanna control when we do it

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.460
they wanna control if we do it

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.240
the conditions under which we do it

00:06:12.241 --> 00:06:14.340
but we do it and we've always been doing it

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.800
the patriarchy does not own women and people with uteruses

00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:20.300
giving birth and having children

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.960
they want to but we've been doing it for a long time

00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:23.640
long time

00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:28.440
before the agricultural revolution and the concept of virginity was invented

00:06:28.441 --> 00:06:31.800
the concept of marriage was invented in order to control patriarchal bloodlines

00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:33.320
we've been doing it for a long time before that

00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.000
we've been doing it since matriarchy

00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:37.800
we've been doing it for a very long time very

00:06:37.801 --> 00:06:40.900
very long time I cannot stress this point enough to me

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.300
choosing to do that is not a patriarchal choice

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.980
I am not somehow like and like

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.620
don't think that your choice to be child free is like

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.480
being a feminist hero either

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:57.660
it's not being child free is not inherently feminist

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.360
just as having a baby is not inherently feminist

00:07:00.361 --> 00:07:01.800
being able to live in a world

00:07:01.801 --> 00:07:06.580
free from structures that dictate how our reproductive systems are policed

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.900
fighting for that world is feminist

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.600
fighting for a world in which we do have choice is feminist

00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:15.180
but the having of the baby

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.340
the not having of the baby

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.240
all that shit no

00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:23.620
we have matriarchal bloodlines that go back to forever

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.620
forever and ever and ever and come along in van patriarchy start wars

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.320
create climate change through greed

00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:31.960
dictate the terms on which women have babies

00:07:31.961 --> 00:07:33.540
so that they're forced to have babies

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.120
and then we turn around create the conditions in which women turn around

00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:40.240
and judge each other for having babies

00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:45.940
that my friends is patriarchy at work stay safe
