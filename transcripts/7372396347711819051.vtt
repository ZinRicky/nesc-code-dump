00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.600
What I eat in a day as a mom on a time crunch

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.601
and as someone who avoids seed oils,

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:05.641
artificial sugars,

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:07.521
dyes and preservatives at all costs.

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:10.681
Breakfast is done in a flash with pasture raised eggs scrambled up.

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:13.201
Lunch is leftover pasture raised chicken fajitas

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:14.681
and a slice of freshly milled

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:16.601
whole grain sourdough bread with bread butter

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:20.281
that I I also made sure to take my whole food

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:23.321
animal based blend of bioavailable vitamins and minerals from

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:27.161
birthright tribute to optimal fertility and female hormonal health.

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:31.441
Dinner was 100% grass fed beef meatball source from my parents farm,

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:33.161
a fennel salad straight from my garden

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:35.781
with Parmigiano Reggiano and simple dressing.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.600
And I had a probiotic coconut yogurt with bee pollen,

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:41.705
berries and a drizzle of raw honey for dessert.
