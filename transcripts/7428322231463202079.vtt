00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
Jacket. And I just took it out of the dryer.

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:04.661
Has been washed and dried.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.740
I got it from the TikTok shop.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.520
There's a link right here.

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:14.541
My favorite part is that you can button the bottom pieces,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.180
the bottom. Bottom three,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.700
and make it look like a pullover,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.480
but it's not. It's still just,

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:21.841
you know,

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:24.261
you don't have to go through all that trouble to take it on and off.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.800
It's like fleece. It's not super thick,

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:31.321
but it's not thin at all, so it's definitely nice.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.841
You can definitely wear it, like,

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:34.761
under a jacket if it's really cold.

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:38.181
You could wear it alone if it's just a little chilly.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.860
And it's got a ton of pockets,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.360
and. Yeah,

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:47.661
it's just a cute little. It's like my Rich Mountain mom sweater.
