00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.920
I've been running around with my kids all day,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.320
but I did wanna come and drop some tags

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.280
and some handles of some accounts

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.320
that I think y'all should good check out.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.080
I think you'll like them.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.640
I'm gonna start with

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.160
the two that I'm the most familiar with.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.080
These are mutuals of mine

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.600
that I've been following for years and years

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.720
and we've had many discussions

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.160
about some of these topics.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.060
And that is Rosa Picosa and time and tenderness.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.800
Cousin Tam is a homeschool

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.280
stay at home mom homemaker.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.080
Deborah for Georgia

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.920
used to be mostly homemaking

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.960
and stay at home mom content.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.540
She has now transferred to

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.120
a political candidate in Georgia.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.280
So go Debra

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.160
and go follow her.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.480
And then two just general like

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.720
mom accounts that I follow that I love are Philip A.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.980
Jackson. Love her dearly.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.260
Beautiful aesthetic,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.240
mom content.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.520
And Patrice Taylor.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.320
She's the relatable

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.320
millennial mom that we all know and love.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.600
And then if you want more of that, like,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.160
1950s aesthetic,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.440
my favorite account is actually on Instagram.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.560
I don't think she has a TikTok,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.160
but it's so Ranna all again.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.120
Tag it down there.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.960
Full 1950s kitchen,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.680
1960s recipes,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.800
full vibe. It's awesome.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.680
I know I have more,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.960
but that's a good start.
