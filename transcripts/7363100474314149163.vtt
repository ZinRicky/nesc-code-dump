Okay, does anybody else feel like music has gotten so depressing lately?

00:04.921 --> 00:07.681
What is with all of these sad,

00:07.682 --> 00:08.881
like, vibey,

00:08.882 --> 00:11.561
slow, emotional song?

00:11.562 --> 00:13.001
I have nothing against Taylor Swift,

00:13.002 --> 00:15.081
but I tried listening to her newest album.

00:15.082 --> 00:17.701
I was like, two or three songs in, and I was like,

00:18.480 --> 00:19.520
I need to get up,

00:19.521 --> 00:21.121
I need to go outside.

00:21.122 --> 00:21.841
I need to, like,

00:21.842 --> 00:24.321
shake off this, like, feeling.

00:24.322 --> 00:25.521
It was just, like,

00:25.522 --> 00:26.401
depressing and, like,

00:26.402 --> 00:28.361
I get it. Sometimes you need a good,

00:28.362 --> 00:29.321
like, sad song, right?

00:29.322 --> 00:31.701
You need a song you can feel and you can, like,

00:31.800 --> 00:33.800
relate to, and it needs to have deep lyrics and.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.081
And those songs are great,

00:35.082 --> 00:38.281
but those songs shouldn't be every song.

00:38.282 --> 00:40.401
Our society needs to pump it up right now.

00:40.402 --> 00:42.441
We need some new music.

00:42.442 --> 00:43.761
We need some fun music.

00:43.762 --> 00:45.141
Where is the Pitbull?

00:45.200 --> 00:46.920
Where's the Jason Derulo?

00:46.921 --> 00:47.921
Where are, like,

00:47.922 --> 00:50.481
the stupid, fun summertime songs?

00:50.482 --> 00:51.241
Where are they?

00:51.242 --> 00:52.601
And on a serious note,

00:52.602 --> 00:54.281
I think it's really important to pay attention

00:54.282 --> 00:55.921
to the type of music you listen to.

00:55.922 --> 00:56.721
And I think sometimes

00:56.722 --> 01:00.661
we overlook how big of a role the media we consume

01:00.800 --> 01:02.600
affects us and affects our emotions

01:02.601 --> 01:03.841
and affects our well being.

01:03.842 --> 01:05.761
We need to get some fun music up in here.

01:05.762 --> 01:07.641
Our society needs some fun.

01:07.642 --> 01:09.306
We are too emotional.
