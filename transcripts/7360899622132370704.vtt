00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.780
There are people that would really rather hang out with a bear

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.560
than a man. I am loving this bear discourse

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.041
but I just have an issue that

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:12.481
it's not appropriate in an Australian context

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:13.981
cause we don't have bears.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.720
So I'm going to pre appropriated for an Australian flora

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:25.561
fauna landscape. I would not live with a man.

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:29.361
I refused to live with male housemates

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:33.681
because it was really important to me that in my home,

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:37.001
given what I do that it was a really safe filling space

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.521
and where I was living,

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:43.361
I just couldn't guarantee that there would be a man

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:45.681
who I would feel entirely comfortable around with

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:49.481
living with. So I chose not to live with men.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:54.781
However, I chose to live with three Sydney funnel web spiders,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.000
which if you don't know what they are,

00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:02.301
they are one of the most deadly spiders in the entire world

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.880
and people die when they get bitten by these spiders.

00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:08.761
They're really, really big and they look like cartoon spiders

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:10.701
like they have those scary eyes.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.960
I had two of them living in my shower

00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:16.521
watching me shower everyday and one of them living in my kitchen.

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:18.201
I do not advise doing this.

00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:21.121
This is not a smart thing to do.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:23.701
But I would have preferred

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.880
and did prefer

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:31.121
to live with three Sydney funnel webs than with one human man.

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:34.961
Eventually I decided that I did need to eradicate them

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:37.521
because I was scared that would Bite my dog um,

00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:45.001
but yeah, I would prefer to encounter an eastern brown snake on a hike

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.761
in the bush than a man

00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:51.561
the reason being that eastern brown snakes tend to keep to themselves

00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:53.321
and not like

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:56.741
walk behind you in a creepy way or try to engage you in conversation

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.900
um, unless you kinda step on them or intimidate them in some way

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.320
they're gonna leave you alone unlike most men

00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:09.321
the other reason that I prefer to encounter an eastern brown snake

00:02:09.322 --> 00:02:11.341
which is a very deadly snake

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.200
is because if I was to get bitten by an eastern brown snake, um,

00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:21.341
I could present at hospital with my very clear wound

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.080
and then no one would ask me like

00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:26.801
why were you there? Like why were you hiking?

00:02:26.802 --> 00:02:28.721
Like what what were you wearing?

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:30.701
Were you your shorts were too short?

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.640
Um, were you drinking?

00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:36.001
Were you drunk? Like were you asking for it?

00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:44.441
Like what did you do to like provoke the eastern brown?

00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:48.441
Like maybe you were sending the eastern brown like mixed signals no,

00:02:48.442 --> 00:02:50.001
no one's gonna ask me that

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:51.541
they're just gonna like

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.940
provide me with the medical support that I need at that time

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.440
no questions asked.

00:02:58.441 --> 00:03:02.981
I would also prefer to surf in the middle of the ocean with a shark

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.840
than with a man because if you've ever surfed with men

00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.801
you'll know that they scream at you

00:03:10.802 --> 00:03:12.821
they get really intimidating

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.120
they yell that you're on their Wave

00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:20.901
and they generally just like take over the entire surf break, um,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.120
without a thought for anyone else.

00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:26.301
It's a really intimidating environment for women to go into

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.760
and yet sharks mainly just keep to themselves.

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:31.581
Most of them aren't dangerous.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.600
Um,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.100
they could be, but they're generally like not.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.440
Um, and they'll just like be there and swim away

00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:42.488
and you probably won't even notice them unlike men.
