00:00.080 --> 00:01.640
I asked my husband what he wanted

00:01.640 --> 00:02.960
for Valentine's Day dinner,

00:02.960 --> 00:04.760
and he said steak and chimichurri.

00:04.760 --> 00:06.880
So I put him on steak duty

00:06.880 --> 00:08.900
while I started all the other stuff.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.040
One of his favorite sauces is chimichurri.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.800
So I got started on chopping up some cilantro

00:13.800 --> 00:14.900
really finely,

00:15.160 --> 00:17.080
then moved on to my parsley.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.560
I like to take a good amount of the stems off,

00:19.560 --> 00:22.440
and then I diced up some garlic,

00:22.440 --> 00:23.880
chilli, and shallot.

00:23.880 --> 00:27.180
I added that to the bowl with my cilantro and parsley.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.680
Squeeze of lemon juice,

00:28.680 --> 00:30.080
some olive oil,

00:30.080 --> 00:31.480
and red wine vinegar.

00:31.480 --> 00:32.880
Also a lot of salt.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.160
Gave that really good mix

00:34.160 --> 00:38.180
and let that sit while he started washing the potatoes.

00:38.360 --> 00:42.080
Lucky can get really specific in his shapes and cuts,

00:42.080 --> 00:45.240
so I decided that he was just in charge of

00:45.240 --> 00:48.360
cutting up all of our fries to get them really uniform.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.240
She did a really good job at well,

00:50.240 --> 00:52.960
I made us an elderberry lime mocktail.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.080
Then he questioned me putting the potatoes in ice water,

00:56.080 --> 00:57.240
but did it anyways.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.180
And I prepped some garlic for the broccolini.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.080
We put all of our food prep out,

01:02.080 --> 01:04.080
and then he dried off the potato.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.040
Or double frying our fries today.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.400
So I gave them their first fry,

01:08.400 --> 01:10.300
set them aside on a wire rack.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.720
Lucky got started on our steaks.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.880
He is always in charge of steaks,

01:14.880 --> 01:17.160
and he also reverse seasons them.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.360
But while those were resting,

01:18.360 --> 01:20.040
I sauteed some broccolini

01:20.040 --> 01:22.660
and some Mushrooms in a ponzu sauce.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.720
And then once our steak was done resting,

01:24.720 --> 01:27.280
I put our fries back in the oil

01:27.280 --> 01:28.920
to get them nice and golden.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.640
I also did this in batches

01:30.640 --> 01:32.520
just to not overcrowd my pot.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.680
And then once they were done,

01:33.680 --> 01:35.840
I sprinkled them with some sea salt,

01:35.840 --> 01:37.540
and then it was time to plate.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.600
Put our fries down.

01:38.600 --> 01:39.680
Broccolini steak

01:39.680 --> 01:41.240
and then topped it with chimichurri.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.600
And lucky said this was a 10 out of 10,

01:43.600 --> 01:45.860
so he had to have another plate after this.
