00:00.120 --> 00:02.280
My husband was on his way out to get a cookies

00:02.280 --> 00:03.520
and cream soft serve,

00:03.520 --> 00:05.720
but I told him I'll just make it for him instead,

00:05.720 --> 00:07.520
so that's exactly what I did.

00:07.520 --> 00:10.680
I started by making my Oreos by combining some flour,

00:10.680 --> 00:12.140
cocoa powder, butter,

00:12.320 --> 00:13.760
some sugar and egg

00:13.760 --> 00:17.320
and then letting that go until it all comes together.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.840
Then I grabbed a baking sheet

00:18.840 --> 00:20.840
that was lined with Parchment paper

00:20.840 --> 00:24.820
and formed little balls that I spaced evenly onto it.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.880
I ended up making two baking sheets

00:26.880 --> 00:28.440
and once the balls were formed

00:28.440 --> 00:30.760
I used my palm to flatten them out.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.880
I put them in the fridge for about 10 minutes

00:32.880 --> 00:35.160
and then pop them in the oven for 10 minutes

00:35.160 --> 00:36.240
and while those cooled

00:36.240 --> 00:38.200
I got started on my filling,

00:38.200 --> 00:39.320
which was just butter,

00:39.320 --> 00:41.480
vanilla, and some powdered sugar.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.180
I beat that until it was light and fluffy

00:44.520 --> 00:47.520
and then transferred it over to a little ziploc bag

00:47.520 --> 00:49.280
cause I didn't have a piping bag.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.920
The filling was so delicious

00:50.920 --> 00:53.940
I kept snacking on it while I was filling my Oreos.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.640
After spreading an even layer on one of the cookies,

00:56.640 --> 00:58.280
I put another one on top

00:58.280 --> 00:59.280
and there you go!

00:59.280 --> 01:01.640
I put some of them aside and then use the rest

01:01.640 --> 01:03.120
for my soft serve ice cream.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.680
I did a mix of cookies without filling and with filling.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.520
For my ice cream

01:07.520 --> 01:08.880
I combine some milk,

01:08.880 --> 01:09.560
heavy cream,

01:09.560 --> 01:10.920
some sugar, some salt

01:10.920 --> 01:11.860
and vanilla.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.480
Put that in My Kitchen Aid.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.640
And let that churn

01:14.640 --> 01:17.460
until it reached the consistency I wanted.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.920
Then I put all of my Oreo cookies in there,

01:19.920 --> 01:22.160
let it go for another five to 10 minutes,

01:22.160 --> 01:25.580
and then it had the perfect soft serve consistency.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.560
Spooned it into my little ramekin,

01:27.560 --> 01:29.680
topped it with some more Oreo cookies,

01:29.680 --> 01:32.520
and I could not resist having a bowl myself.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.461
And it was really good.
