00:00.560 --> 00:04.300
I want to give you a little Ireland trip update.

00:04.760 --> 00:07.000
Daniel is getting very good at driving

00:07.001 --> 00:09.101
on the opposite side of the road.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.400
We went to a farmer's market this morning,

00:12.401 --> 00:16.941
and I found a vendor that was selling her homemade water kipper.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.400
And this is her beetroot version,

00:20.401 --> 00:22.321
which was so earthy and delicious.

00:22.322 --> 00:28.021
I loved it. We also went on a walk to the cliffs of Bali cotton,

00:28.080 --> 00:30.160
and we walked along the path.

00:30.161 --> 00:33.601
It was there. It was breathtakingly beautiful.

00:33.602 --> 00:36.201
We all loved it so much. The air.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.761
The ocean air was so moist and humid,

00:39.762 --> 00:42.821
and honestly, I love humidity so much,

00:42.880 --> 00:45.960
but it was beautiful. Um,

00:45.961 --> 00:48.041
Fran, for some reason,

00:48.042 --> 00:51.001
here in Ireland, her hair is looking so red.

00:51.002 --> 00:52.481
Daniel was looking like Mr.

00:52.482 --> 00:55.301
Darcy in that last clip, so I had to take a video.

00:55.320 --> 00:58.307
And we watched the sunset on the cliffs. It was so.
