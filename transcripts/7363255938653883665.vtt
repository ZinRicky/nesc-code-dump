00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.180
my TikToks have clearly found the wrong side recently

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.660
but I just wanna say something

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.180
these type of comments will never ever

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.580
ever affect me

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:24.260
because I have always had a very strong and high level of self esteem

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.720
and I have also always had a really strong moral compass

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.821
I remember when I was

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.640
I think 16

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.061
and I went to a music festival

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.320
and there were guys with placards who were rating out of 10

00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:40.741
all the girls that walked past

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.220
and I knew at the time that that was wrong and that was like over 10 years ago

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.260
I recognise at a really early age that men are always gonna do this

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.360
and that I needed to create safeguards inside myself

00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:59.941
that would not to do with my physical appearance

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.780
I recognise that I was gonna age

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.380
and I knew that if I put all of my confidence and self esteem on how I looked

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.620
that I would at some stage become very unhappy with myself

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.520
I recognised that society was asking me to do that

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:29.061
to put all of my energy and money into how I looks

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.600
and that I would be rewarded as a woman for doing that

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:37.761
and that that is a trap and I thought about that a lot when I was young

00:01:37.762 --> 00:01:40.201
like my late teens my early 20s

00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:43.721
I thought about that a lot and how to overcome that

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:48.241
I decided to put a lot of therapy and energy into not

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:55.081
becoming a woman who was completely attached to the way I look

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:57.441
and needing that type of external validation

00:01:57.442 --> 00:02:02.241
especially from men in order to feel good about myself

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:07.641
so I have been training for this for a long time

00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:13.681
and I luckily have a very strong sense of self worth

00:02:13.682 --> 00:02:17.001
and I also know that I'm hot

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:25.621
like it's not a question it's not something that I'm gonna ever ask myself

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.100
I know

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.820
like I just know on a deep level and it's nothing you say is gonna change that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.340
it doesn't matter how outspoken I am and how much I annoy you

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.440
and how much I say things that are gonna annoy you

00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:46.601
there's nothing that you can say to change my mind or these issues

00:02:46.602 --> 00:02:49.661
or to make me feel bad about myself

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.960
fortunately

00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:59.541
I love myself and I have a wonderful partner and he absolutely adores me

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.020
I have incredible friends who absolutely adore me

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.520
I have amazing family who absolutely adore me

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:13.641
there is nothing that you can say that's gonna be the mic drop moment

00:03:13.642 --> 00:03:14.741
you think it is

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.780
and I know this won't stop trolls cause that's not how trolls work

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.400
but I just want to put that out there

00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:23.941
it is not doing what you think it's doing
