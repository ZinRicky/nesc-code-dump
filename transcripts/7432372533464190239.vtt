00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
As a professional content creator

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.561
that gets featured in major publications all the time,

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:06.901
CNN people, Hollywood Reporter,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.960
Tamarind Hall show. I create content for money.

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:12.801
I make money on the content I make.

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:16.921
And I truly fucking love this vlogging kit from TikTok Shop.

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:18.401
It comes with everything you need.

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:19.881
I haven't had a light this whole time.

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:21.161
I just had to use a window.

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:22.161
This thing's amazing.

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:25.001
I'm pretty sure it's exactly like the other viral light.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.721
It just also comes with a tripod,

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:29.641
the microphone. The most you have to do is get this little attachment.

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:31.801
If you have an iPhone, if you don't have a phone that has like,

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:34.361
a Jack, I'm not kidding you.

00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:37.161
This tripod also, it folds down so little,

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.561
so it's really easy to take wherever you have to go.

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:41.161
All the attachments come right off.

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:43.121
You just break this bad boy down.

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.041
And even comes with, like,

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:45.601
a little bag to carry it with you.

00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:46.321
I'm telling you,

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:49.801
if you have somebody in your life that wants to start creating content,

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:51.801
if you yourself wanna start creating content,

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:55.561
this little tripod is absolutely worth the money

00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:59.921
and absolutely gonna help you create better content.

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:02.148
It's linked right here if you want one. I highly recommend it.
