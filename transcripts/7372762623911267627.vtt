00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.440
the thing of these cunty of nails that no one tells you is

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:04.580
when you have gems on your nails

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.240
you can't do anything

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:08.800
like how am I supposed to wash my hair with my nails

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:09.960
like there's what it

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.720
look at this big ass gem

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:12.900
like I

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.860
I'm gonna go wash my hair right now

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.660
and this is how

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.840
this is the solution that I've come up with

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:24.300
because otherwise it's gonna get stuck in my hair

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.640
and I don't know

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:26.720
I don't know if this is just me

00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:27.840
I don't know if it's a skill issue

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:29.480
probably is cause my first time having them

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:35.300
but like how am I supposed to function with a big ass charm on my finger

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.660
um so I'm gonna go wash my hair right now

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.660
wish me luck
