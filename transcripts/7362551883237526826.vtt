00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
The best people in life are the ones who can pretty much find anything interesting

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:09.201
people who are curious about other people's passions 

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:13.681
if you tell someone about the book or something you enjoy cooking

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.721
any passion that you have

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:19.141
and they find it interesting and they're curious about it

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.040
That makes them a better person

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:22.001
a better friend

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.521
when they're curious about your passions

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:26.281
whatever you're passionate about

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:29.201
they genuinely care and ask you questions

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:31.913
There’s nothing worse than when you wanna talk about your passions 

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:32.561
and they're like

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:34.001
oh yeah cool..

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.281
they dismiss you or they don't care

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:39.061
or they just wanna change the topic or talk about themselves

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.560
Maybe their interest or passions aren't your thing

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.581
but why not be curious about them

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:46.445
You’re not asking too much to have 

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.081
someone emotionally understand you

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:49.361
and hear you are

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:54.081
that's why I think people who are curious and interested of your passions

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:56.021
are the best kinds of people/friends
