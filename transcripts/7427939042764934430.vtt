Sir, for $10,000,

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:03.601
name a manly thing that Donald Trump has done.

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:06.561
Nothing manly. Please.

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:08.201
What is your name? King.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:09.781
No, I really can't.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.320
Does it exist? Who is this Rudy poo?

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:15.401
Shoot socials. What? Tanking? Exactly.

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:20.821
That's what I thought, you overgrown 500 pound bag of monkey crap.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.480
See? What?

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.241
Three times? I'm sorry,

00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:24.761
my parents are business owners.

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:25.841
They've declared bankruptcy.

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:27.181
What? Zero.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.860
An elder manly thing? Maybe like shit his pants

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.800
maybe. Peace.

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:40.821
Standing up. You're talking about Kelsey.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.160
What about the fact that he spends more time blending his concealer

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:44.661
than crafting form policy?

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.940
I don't think he does. He does not know how to properly blend.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.420
Haha,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.560
maybe that is the most manly thing

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:56.241
is that he doesn't know how to blend his makeup.

00:00:56.242 --> 00:00:56.681
No, no,

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:58.681
this is My Pretty Pony. Don't touch my Pretty Pony.

00:00:58.682 --> 00:00:59.921
It's my sister's. Okay,

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:02.461
just name a manly thing that Donald Trump has done.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.700
I'll get back to you.
