00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.520
I think lots of a homemakers have this Assumption

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.320
that there is some way out there to make life easier.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.540
Like some tips,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.180
some trick that we just don't know.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.080
Something that makes the day easier

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.720
and keeps the household together.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.920
Something that keeps the Mills keep on coming.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.400
And the house clean,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.420
the children happy and educated.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.760
And the grass mode,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.940
the animals fed.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.440
But in all reality,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.720
there is no real trick to it.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.400
It's just repetition,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.340
hard work. Keep going,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.620
keep waking up,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.940
keep your smile on your face.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.140
And just keep the Mills coming.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.840
Although with practice and education,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.360
these tasks become easier,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.660
more enjoyable,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.120
and more fulfilling.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.440
When you get things right,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.740
the food tastes better,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.220
the education flows easier.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.560
But this is just your encouragement.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.440
To let you know that there is no real trick.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.980
You're not doing anything wrong.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.380
Just keep on going. Repetition,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.420
education. Practice makes everything easier.
