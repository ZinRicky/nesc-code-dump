00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
I've raised chickens now for about seven years

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:04.501
and this year we decided to do our first meat growth.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.200
With the rising cost of meat

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:08.401
and us wanting to have a bit more food security,

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:11.141
we thought raising meat birds would be a good idea for us.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.960
This week

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:14.741
we've been slowly processing them all and getting them in the freezer.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.680
So let me show you how we do it.

00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:18.641
It's pretty important that you have the right equipment.

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:20.641
You can buy this equipment or you can rent it,

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:22.801
or you can also make some of your own.

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:24.161
We decided to purchase ours

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.781
as we know we're gonna be doing some more ME bits in the future.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.360
Is a kill cone. Is pretty important step.

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.561
This keeps the chicken really calm,

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:36.241
holds it nice and snug and keeps it still while you do the, um,

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:40.081
ending right here. I use garden snips

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:43.501
as it is the most quick and efficient way to get the job done.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.560
And you will let the bird sit here and bleed out.

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:46.721
There is some movement still.

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:50.281
This is just the muscles and tendons still moving around.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:51.961
We've heard of the saying the headless chicken

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:53.561
is because if you cut a chicken's head off,

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:55.481
it will still run around. It is dead,

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:58.621
but the body still has energy built up inside it.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.840
Then I'm gonna dip the chickens in 150 degree water.

00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:03.941
This removes the skin and feathers.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.200
The heat in the water opens the Pores up on the skin

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:08.961
for the feathers to be easily removed.

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:10.601
We also put Dawn dish soap in here.

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:12.961
And this definitely gives the chicken a little clean

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:14.841
cause they are dirty. They got poop in their feet.

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.601
Um, so I like to do the step two.

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:19.021
And now we're gonna head over to the chicken plucker.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.960
Now, we did purchase this plucker

00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:23.601
as we plan on raising chickens for the year.

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:25.521
Um, you can rent yours.

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:27.521
Um, this didn't work as well as I thought it would.

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.981
The chicken thing sometimes gets stuck in the rubbers,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.220
little rubber knobs. But it did the job.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.800
I'm gonna give it a final rinse off

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:37.821
as I don't want any feathers or dirt on the chicken.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.720
Then I'm gonna start the butchering process.

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.001
First off, I cut the feet.

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:43.761
I'm gonna save the feet for making broth.

00:01:43.762 --> 00:01:45.001
I'm gonna get rid of the skin.

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.501
I don't want the skin in the broth.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.000
I have a little bin to the side of me that has, um,

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.121
stuff I wanna save for broth.

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:53.401
And then the other bin has, um,

00:01:53.402 --> 00:01:55.961
where I'm gonna put all the organs and giblets that I don't wanna keep.

00:01:55.962 --> 00:01:59.381
The next step is I'm gonna cut open in the top,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.760
underneath the neck here, and I'm gonna cut the crop out.

00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:02.721
When a chicken eats,

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:05.441
it first goes down to the crop before it goes down to its intestines.

00:02:05.442 --> 00:02:07.301
The crop kinda acts like its stomach.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.600
Um, so I'm gonna slightly, uh, slowly.

00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:12.461
Sorry. Pull this out with my hands.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.760
Try not to use a knife, as I don't wanna nip into it.

00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:19.476
And I'm gonna remove the esophagus, um, and the windpipe.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.760
I'm gonna keep using my fingers,

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.541
as it is the best way to kind of remove the membranes.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800
Some membranes are tough. This one was a pretty easy one.

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:32.401
And then I'm gonna yank on that

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.961
and pull the intestine part up

00:02:34.962 --> 00:02:37.921
into where it kind of just releases right there.

00:02:37.922 --> 00:02:39.461
And I'm just gonna nip it off.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.960
Now I'm gonna take the neck off,

00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:48.721
and I'm gonna save this for chicken broth.

00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:52.621
It's got lots of fat on it and that great bones for bone broth.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.440
Then I remove the tail. Some people call this the Pope's nose.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.761
Um, some people say to remove it,

00:02:56.762 --> 00:02:57.561
some people say to leave it.

00:02:57.562 --> 00:03:00.481
I did half and half, so I'll be able to tell if

00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:02.821
in the future that I would like to remove it.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.480
Then I'm gonna carefully cut into the bow area

00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:08.141
and remove all the internal organs.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.080
It's very important that you don't pierce open any of the bowel.

00:03:12.081 --> 00:03:14.321
You don't want any bacteria, salmonella,

00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:17.081
E. Coli or whatever to break into the meat.

00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:19.061
Here's the part where I cut off the top there.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.080
Um, that was the pipe

00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:22.901
that was leading into that part of the chicken's intestines.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.800
Now I'm pulling them all out.

00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:26.541
I pulling out some kidneys.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.180
Um, the liver's Right here.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.120
And you gonna gently and firmly pull this off.

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.001
You can see this chicken had a lot of fat on it.

00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:35.841
This chicken could have been butchered a few weeks ago.

00:03:35.842 --> 00:03:37.901
We just had some time restraints.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.360
Now I'm gonna slightly and carefully cut the butthole out,

00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:47.001
and without nicking and cutting the intestines,

00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:48.821
but I do want to keep some of that fat.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.674
These chickens have a lot of fat around their buttholes.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.540
Now that's complete, I can remove the lungs and the heart.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.160
Hmm.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.680
I'm just getting everything a little look over.

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:09.561
And just to show you guys, um,

00:04:09.562 --> 00:04:11.401
what the organs look like inside,

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:13.961
this chicken definitely had some, um,

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.381
build up of fat on the organs.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.080
It was time for it to be expired.

00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:18.041
Um, but, yeah,

00:04:18.042 --> 00:04:19.721
no disease. Um,

00:04:19.722 --> 00:04:20.561
it was a pretty healthy chicken.

00:04:20.562 --> 00:04:24.001
And I'm gonna package it in this plastic chicken bags,

00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:24.961
and I'm gonna put it on ice.

00:04:24.962 --> 00:04:28.621
And then later on, I will shrink wrap these and put them in the freezer.
