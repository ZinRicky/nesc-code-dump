Tonight is supper club.

00:03.321 --> 00:07.361
So basically, what that means is every few weeks,

00:07.362 --> 00:13.721
we invite some friends and family over, and we have a meal together.

00:13.722 --> 00:17.641
And we make a meal with food that we either raised

00:17.642 --> 00:21.101
or we buy it from a farm that we know and trust.

00:21.280 --> 00:25.100
And so everything that is made really has a lot of

00:26.360 --> 00:27.360
love poured into,

00:27.361 --> 00:28.481
and you can really feel that.

00:28.482 --> 00:31.841
I remember sitting in my interview and Miss American,

00:31.842 --> 00:33.801
and I was being asked by the judges,

00:33.802 --> 00:34.921
you know, what's your platform?

00:34.922 --> 00:35.521
Know your food,

00:35.522 --> 00:36.541
know your farmer.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.040
And I. I told them,

00:38.041 --> 00:41.681
I said, there's something so satisfying when you sit down to a meal

00:41.682 --> 00:43.281
and you know how it got there.

00:43.282 --> 00:45.461
You know how these animals were raised.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.320
You know what time it took to grow these vegetables

00:48.321 --> 00:50.441
because you helped grow them.

00:50.442 --> 00:52.161
Think there's something so satisfying,

00:52.162 --> 00:54.281
so beautiful about that, though.

00:54.282 --> 00:58.561
Supper club is a way where you can gather with friends and just, um,

00:58.562 --> 00:59.481
feel that together.

00:59.482 --> 01:00.981
It's such, uh.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.360
It's such a beautiful thing.

01:02.361 --> 01:05.161
And I always feel so grateful for, um,

01:05.162 --> 01:08.981
the meal, and I love teaching my kids that as well.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.680
So something that we have implemented in our lives,

01:11.681 --> 01:13.761
and it's definitely highlight of the week.

01:13.762 --> 01:16.161
Our friends are also band players,

01:16.162 --> 01:18.261
so they always in the night with music.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.740
I'm gonna take you to the.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.720
For these days.

01:24.721 --> 01:26.661
Hey. Oh, wow.
