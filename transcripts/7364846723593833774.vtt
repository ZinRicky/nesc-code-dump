00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
This is the first time I'm gonna be moving in with somebody since

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:04.001
my husband. You know what I mean?

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:05.121
Like, in that kind of way.

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:06.901
So, um,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.140
teeny, tiny, small update on moving.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.180
The boxes are still there,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.360
but, um. Okay,

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:15.941
so since me and my boyfriend are moving in together,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.000
and he works from home and I work from home,

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.361
we were like, let's try this out.

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:23.961
So we've literally been practicing,

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:24.801
and he's been, like,

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:26.241
staying here for multiple.

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:28.701
Because usually he would at least go home once a day or something.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.800
Just spent all of our time together aside from, like,

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:32.361
the couple hours that he would go home.

00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:33.241
But now he's been like, no,

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:33.721
I'm gonna, like,

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:34.401
do some laundry,

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:35.481
bring a few things over,

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:36.281
stay for a couple days,

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:37.461
and then I'll go home.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.020
And I'm literally, like,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.440
not seeing a problem.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.161
We are just super easy,

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:47.501
get along. People that really just want peace and love

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.620
and are super happy and willing to work together to make that happen.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.840
He calls me kids,

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:53.481
his roommates.

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:54.961
It's the cutest thing ever.

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:55.681
He's like, yeah,

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:57.381
my little rent free roomies.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.460
Hey, hey.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.680
It's adorable.

00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:01.461
It's adorable.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.200
Um, it is truly, like,

00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:06.081
making me, like,

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:06.441
fall, like,

00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:08.701
a deeper level of love with him,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.720
you know what I mean?

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:11.921
He's, like, respecting my wishes,

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:13.001
respecting me.

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:14.401
He's checking in with me.

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:15.281
It's not all about me.

00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:17.121
I'm just saying, he's the here to speak his part.

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:18.341
And I can speak for him.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.580
I'm just saying

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.600
for my experience as a single mom moving in with my boyfriend.

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:25.521
A boyfriend for.

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:27.541
I don't know. I'm super,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.680
super, super into this.

00:01:29.681 --> 00:01:30.841
I'm super excited.

00:01:30.842 --> 00:01:32.921
I'm super. I'm super,

00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:35.301
super looking forward to the future.
