As a German, there would always be Nutella in our house,

00:02.761 --> 00:04.481
and every time it would run low,

00:04.482 --> 00:06.401
a new jar would magically appear.

00:06.402 --> 00:10.301
So today I decided to introduce my husband to the concept of Nutella

00:10.320 --> 00:11.160
and crepes.

00:11.161 --> 00:15.041
I started by roasting my hazelnuts in the oven for about 10 minutes,

00:15.042 --> 00:18.881
letting them cool slightly before rubbing them to get all the skin off.

00:18.882 --> 00:21.401
I then transferred them over to my food processor

00:21.402 --> 00:25.861
and let that go until they turned into a very shiny paste.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.360
This point I added in my melted chocolate,

00:28.361 --> 00:29.521
some cocoa powder,

00:29.522 --> 00:33.021
vanilla, a pinch of salt, and some powdered sugar,

00:33.080 --> 00:34.920
turn my food processor back on

00:34.921 --> 00:38.121
and let that go while drizzling in some neutral oil.

00:38.122 --> 00:41.161
Once that all came together, I put it aside,

00:41.162 --> 00:42.321
let it cool slightly,

00:42.322 --> 00:43.981
and that was our homemade Nutella.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.720
I moved on to making my crepe batter by adding some eggs,

00:47.721 --> 00:48.801
milk, water,

00:48.802 --> 00:50.801
vanilla, a pinch of salt,

00:50.802 --> 00:53.721
whisking that while I gradually added in some flour,

00:53.722 --> 00:55.721
making sure that there's no clumps,

00:55.722 --> 00:57.521
and also some melted butter.

00:57.522 --> 01:00.401
I heated up my pan and my batter in

01:00.402 --> 01:02.601
before spreading it as thin as I could.

01:02.602 --> 01:04.161
Once my crepes were golden brown,

01:04.162 --> 01:07.701
I folded them up and drizzled them with some of my homemade Nutella.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.100
When my husband tried them, he was shocked at how good they were.
