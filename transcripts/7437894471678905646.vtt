00:00.120 --> 00:02.520
Love is never enough

00:02.521 --> 00:05.680
anyone with a brain and a pulse can fall in love with someone

00:05.681 --> 00:08.560
but that is never gonna sustain a relationship

00:08.561 --> 00:10.480
What will is connection

00:10.481 --> 00:13.360
safety, trust and communication

00:13.361 --> 00:15.040
You can love someone until you're blue in the face

00:15.041 --> 00:16.440
but that's not gonna be enough

00:16.441 --> 00:17.880
The better question to ask is

00:17.881 --> 00:20.300
Does your partner feel valued and respected?

00:20.480 --> 00:22.120
Do they feel like a priority in your life,

00:22.121 --> 00:23.480
Do you appreciate each other?

00:23.481 --> 00:25.880
Can you take accountability when you mess up?

00:25.881 --> 00:30.640
Can you repair conflicts and are you someone that they can be vulnerable around?

00:30.641 --> 00:33.840
Do you listen when they tell you what they need to feel valued?

00:33.841 --> 00:36.340
“HOW” you love each other is the biggest difference.
