00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
I think it is you,

00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:04.861
the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.240
Yes, women have been lied to,

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:08.481
but I do not think it's the way that this guy's talking about.

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:09.481
Women have been lied to

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:11.801
with the expectation that the division of labor

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:14.401
when it comes to raising children and a family will be equitable,

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:17.681
because they are also pulling in a paycheck as a working parent,

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:20.681
at least socially for the majority.

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:24.161
Societally, we've made just enough room to allow women to go to work

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.641
and then also come home and do all of the domestic labor,

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:29.961
all while making less sense on the dollar than their male counterparts.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:33.481
And that's even less if you are a black woman or a woman of color.

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:34.481
But I digress.

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:35.561
I am a Liberal,

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:36.681
progressive homemaker,

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:37.801
housewife, homeschooler.

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:38.761
I cook from scratch,

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:39.601
I have a garden.

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:42.401
So I understand the value of the work that I do

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:44.241
and the fulfillment that I get from it.

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:46.441
But I also have a university degree.

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:49.381
And you know what nobody wants to fucking hear

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.800
when they're sitting there

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:54.521
celebrating the hard work and dedication of the past four years

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:56.181
in order to get a degree,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.760
regardless of how they feel about getting married or having kids.

00:00:58.761 --> 00:00:59.941
Maybe they want to.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.560
Doesn't really matter in this context,

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.761
because that's not what they are sitting there for.

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:04.961
Cause I don't know anybody.

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:08.201
And granted I didn't go to a conservative private Catholic college.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:11.241
That probably changes the thoughts of the demographic.

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:14.101
But I don't know anybody who's gonna sit there at their graduation

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.540
and be like, huh,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.880
this was fun. This was a fun little pastime.

00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:21.281
I can't wait to be a homemaker.

00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:24.881
And I graduated with plenty of women who ended up being housewives.

00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:25.321
But, you know,

00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:28.021
when they were not thinking about that at their college graduation,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.440
I know I wasn't.

00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:31.841
Because my role as a homemaker

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:36.161
housewife did not come out of patriarchal or religious pressure.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.361
It came out of financial reasons.

00:01:38.362 --> 00:01:40.581
It came out of looking at our lifestyle,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.680
looking at how much time I would wanna be around my own kids,

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:46.281
looking at the price of child care,

00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:48.361
looking at the lifestyle that it would afford us.

00:01:48.362 --> 00:01:49.641
You know, all sorts of, like,

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.161
other reasons that are completely valid.

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:53.501
But their graduation

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.780
speech is the moment you thought these young ladies

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.120
would want to hear,

00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:02.081
like, a celebratory, good job, ladies.

00:02:02.082 --> 00:02:02.801
But, like,

00:02:02.802 --> 00:02:04.881
we all know you just wanna have kids.

00:02:04.882 --> 00:02:08.081
That's a perfectly valid life choice, too.

00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:09.281
You should do that.

00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:11.381
Look how happy my wife is.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.920
My wife, who's.

00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:16.901
Who's the wife of an NFL, Super Bowl winning kicker.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.540
Yeah. Being a housewife and a homemaker

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.380
under those circumstances

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.640
is probably gonna look a lot different than for a lot of other people.

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:26.121
I mean, I'm not really surprised.

00:02:26.122 --> 00:02:27.641
Like, this was a commencement speech.

00:02:27.642 --> 00:02:29.161
I know the entire thing is meant to, like,

00:02:29.162 --> 00:02:31.121
Just incense the general public.

00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:36.121
But like, this was a commencement speech to a very specific audience.

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:40.161
And that audience are people who are so aligned with Catholicism

00:02:40.162 --> 00:02:41.721
and the Catholic faith

00:02:41.722 --> 00:02:45.801
that they decided to go to a private Catholic University.

00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:49.241
And these are the views of conservative Christianity.

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:51.401
And truly, if you wanna talk about it,

00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:54.101
these are the views of a lot of religions.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.200
The further into orthodoxy and conservatism you get.

00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:58.121
Fun personal note.

00:02:58.122 --> 00:03:00.601
My mom was actually raised Catholic, and, um,

00:03:00.602 --> 00:03:02.101
she went to a Catholic university.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.520
And she had such a horrible experience there, um,

00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:08.661
that she met my dad right after graduation

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.160
and married him and converted to Judaism.

00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:13.821
So good job with the PR.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.062
Oh, she also went to a post grad and became a doctor. So go mom!
