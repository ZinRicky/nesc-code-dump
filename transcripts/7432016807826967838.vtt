00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.120
Three hundred pounds is actually the limit.

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:06.861
300 pounds is the limit for this little rebounding trampoline.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.360
And it's got the bungee cords

00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:12.521
and it does have safety locks,

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:14.681
so it's never gonna like, unfold,

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:16.321
because you'd be surprised at how small this comes

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:18.441
when it comes to you. It's got Protection,

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:19.441
so it's never gonna, like,

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:20.721
collapse while you're using it.

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:23.241
You're good. And this is literally

00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:27.601
one of the most low impact exercises you can do for your body.

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:30.161
That is has the same effect as jogging.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.121
Like 10, I think it's like

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:34.401
15 minutes on the little trampoline is equivalent to like

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:36.201
a 30 minute run outside.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.761
But you don't have the same pressure on your joints and everything.

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:42.161
So especially if you're at a higher weight

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:43.481
and you're trying to really get down,

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:45.021
you're not just doing it to maintain.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.041
This little thing is amazing. It's linked right here.
