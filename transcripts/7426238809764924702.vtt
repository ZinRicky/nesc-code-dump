One thing that I pride myself in is getting creative in the kitchen

00:05.761 --> 00:07.801
when I feel like there's nothing to make.

00:07.802 --> 00:10.781
So that was tonight. I went into the fridge, pantry,

00:11.000 --> 00:13.900
I felt like we had nothing to eat,

00:14.080 --> 00:16.880
but I did see this bag of masa harina,

00:16.881 --> 00:17.761
and I was like, okay,

00:17.762 --> 00:19.741
you know what? Let's make some corn tortillas.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.520
We made the corn tortillas.

00:21.521 --> 00:25.561
It's just masa harina and water and a little bit of salt.

00:25.562 --> 00:31.261
We rolled them out. We also had a thawed roast beef roast.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.340
We chopped that up, cooked that,

00:34.520 --> 00:37.800
and we also had one very large sweet potato.

00:37.801 --> 00:40.441
We diced that, we roasted it,

00:40.442 --> 00:42.161
and then we assembled everything.

00:42.162 --> 00:43.481
We had a homemade tortilla.

00:43.482 --> 00:45.521
They turned out so good, so soft.

00:45.522 --> 00:49.461
We put in some of our homemade pickled radishes,

00:49.640 --> 00:53.380
are sweet potatoes, a big dollop of sour cream,

00:53.480 --> 00:56.780
and honestly, it turned out to be one of the best meals of the week.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.960
So sometimes when you're feeling like,

00:58.961 --> 01:00.801
you know what? We have nothing to eat,

01:00.802 --> 01:02.001
you just gotta get creative,

01:02.002 --> 01:03.581
because that's where the magic happens.
