00:00.080 --> 00:01.400
Good morning, guys.

00:01.401 --> 00:03.201
I've been sick for the past few days,

00:03.202 --> 00:05.161
so I haven't been on here in a minute.

00:05.162 --> 00:08.401
But today I was in the mood for some Japanese breakfast,

00:08.402 --> 00:10.501
so that's what I'm making right now.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.560
Okay, so let's plate it up.

00:12.561 --> 00:15.321
I have some miso soup over here.

00:15.322 --> 00:16.821
I'm gonna show you guys.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.560
I love a good miso soup.

00:18.561 --> 00:19.641
I don't have tofu,

00:19.642 --> 00:20.721
so it's without tofu.

00:20.722 --> 00:22.441
This is our miso soup.

00:22.442 --> 00:24.681
Let's plate up all the other stuff.

00:24.682 --> 00:26.361
So I made some salmon.

00:26.362 --> 00:29.101
Let's do that next. I have some salmon,

00:29.360 --> 00:31.440
a charred miso salmon.

00:31.441 --> 00:33.441
I also made some rice.

00:33.442 --> 00:35.761
I've been up since the crack of dawn,

00:35.762 --> 00:37.841
so I'm so excited to have some breakfast.

00:37.842 --> 00:40.161
Right now we have our rice and salmon,

00:40.162 --> 00:42.581
and then I made some side dishes.

00:42.760 --> 00:46.720
The first side dish is gonna be some edamame that I'm just gonna salt.

00:46.721 --> 00:49.381
I've got some smoky sea salt,

00:51.680 --> 00:53.080
so that's done.

00:53.081 --> 00:56.441
And then I also just sauteed some spinach

00:56.442 --> 00:59.361
with some sesame oil and sesame seeds.

00:59.362 --> 01:00.581
This is our spinach.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.400
Oh, I made some pickled cucumber salad,

01:05.401 --> 01:07.021
so I'm gonna do that next.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.120
This is one of my favorite little sides that I make.

01:13.121 --> 01:14.201
I have it quite a lot,

01:14.202 --> 01:16.321
and I always make it a little different.

01:16.322 --> 01:18.081
Okay, I think we're ready to eat this,

01:18.082 --> 01:21.241
our little Japanese inspired breakfast spread.

01:21.242 --> 01:22.801
I'm so excited right now.

01:22.802 --> 01:25.181
So excited to try the salmon.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.620
Seaweed and the miso soup is always my favorite thing.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.940
Mm hmm. Oh,

01:34.040 --> 01:37.700
I forgot. I also made myself a cup of fennel tea.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.800
I've been really liking fennel tea lately,

01:40.801 --> 01:42.041
so that's what I've been having.

01:42.042 --> 01:44.816
But I'm gonna sit down and have some breakfast now.
