00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.240
A little over a year ago,

00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:04.521
I made a video talking about learning the joys of home making

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:06.761
and the responses were very interesting.

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:10.321
Half were very encouraging and half were like,

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:12.801
what the heck? Why doesn't your husband help you?

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:14.521
So I just wanted to clear up a few things

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:17.801
a year later about common misconceptions about home making.

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:20.681
Number one, home making is not just for women.

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:23.841
Home making is for anyone and everyone who cares about stewarding

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:24.601
their home whatever.

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:27.401
In our home, that looks like splitting a lot of the chores.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.441
Jacob does the dishes half the time.

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:31.121
I do it the other half of the time.

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:34.241
He takes out the trash, I take care of laundry.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.161
You get the job. Misconception number two

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:39.961
is that you have to be a stay at home mom or wife

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:41.841
and you have to be able to make sourdough.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:42.921
That's just not true.

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:46.521
There is an aesthetic that has been made online about home making

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:48.841
and I definitely lean into it a little bit

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:50.521
because it's fun to put on a pretty dress

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:52.041
and make things from scratch,

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:53.121
but it is not the norm.

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:56.401
Misconception number three is that this is my only job

00:00:56.402 --> 00:00:58.401
and this is all I do. That's not true.

00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:00.041
I do social media full time

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:02.761
along with working with the cast of Little House on the parade.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.801
I hope that I can encourage you to find the joy of home making,

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:07.107
cause it really is A joy
