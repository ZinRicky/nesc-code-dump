00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.340
So it's November 18th, and again, I'm wearing,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.820
basically a summer outfit with a jacket on.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.800
Um, I left the house.

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:10.561
It was 67 degrees right now in New York,

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:12.521
and it's 60 degrees now that I'm coming home.

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:13.541
But, like,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.180
I should not be this warm in November.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.160
Like, it's nice I don't have to pull up my winter wardrobe just yet,

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.041
but, like,

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:24.501
I don't know, I'm starting to worry.
