00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.360
I think the whole conversation

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:03.481
about Mother's Day being for moms in the trenches

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:05.001
has kind of gotten lost in the sauce

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.241
here on TikTok.

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:08.081
Made a lot of videos about this over the years.

00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:09.801
So I am definitely of the

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:10.961
the mom with the young kids

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:12.921
to do whatever the fuck she wants on Mother's Day.

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:14.161
But here's the thing.

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:18.081
If you, with a young child, wanna spend your Mother's Day with your mom,

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:18.761
with your grandma,

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:19.761
with other moms,

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:22.041
you should do whatever you want to do.

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:25.081
The point is that if a mom who has young kids

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:27.441
wants to spend the day reading a book on the beach by herself

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:28.881
and getting a moment of peace,

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:32.021
that she should be able to do that without obligation or guilt.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.840
A lot of what's being lost in this conversation

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:35.621
is that the mom with the young kids

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.680
probably doesn't have a good boundary set with her mother

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:39.601
or her grandmother

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:40.921
or her mother in law.

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:44.241
She routinely takes a back seat in her wants and needs.

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:46.281
And she should be allowed to have one day

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:48.341
where her wants and needs are considered,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.720
because although she's of course

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:51.281
always gonna be her mother's daughter,

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:53.241
she should be able to spend that day however she wants

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:55.801
because she's not less of a mother than her own mother.

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:58.021
She could probably use the break from packing the kids up

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.326
and taking a back seat.
