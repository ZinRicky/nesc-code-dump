00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.080
Again, the judgement that women face

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:05.981
regarding whether or not to have children

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.860
reflects the societal pressures that are rooted in long standing

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.980
patriarchal norms. This is a judgement statement.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.740
I am selfish if I want to have children.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.860
Don't think that this judgement is immune to

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.400
any sort of societal pressures

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:28.601
that you feel

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:32.081
just the way that the choice to have a child is not a man.

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:35.561
So let's start with talking about the choice to have a child.

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:37.881
So women disproportionately to men

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:42.641
are judged for exercising their right to have a child

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:45.241
due to external pressures in modern times

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:47.941
such as climate change, overpopulation,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.820
other environmental concerns for the economy.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.620
In the same token,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.440
women are pressurized to have children for the economy, I.

00:00:58.441 --> 00:00:59.721
E. Baby bonus,

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:00.801
baby boom. So

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:04.281
it's women who are often expected to balance personal aspirations

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:08.801
to start a family with these concerns about our future

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:11.101
and what am I bringing my child into

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.140
and all of that. Sometimes people see children as inflicting life

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.380
non consensually upon someone.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.600
Let's talk about the choice to not have children.

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.861
Again, women are judged for not having children,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.080
also called selfish, strangely,

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:28.421
for wanting to focus on their careers

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.520
or just wanting to indulge in a life that is child free.

00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:34.801
For whatever reason,

00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:40.101
people see women's natural role as the role of a mother.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.780
And therefore, when women

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.720
question that or choose to live differently to that social norm,

00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:50.721
they are critique judged. But my point is that

00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:52.641
it doesn't matter which way you're judging a woman,

00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:53.761
you're still judging a woman.

00:01:53.762 --> 00:01:55.941
And either of these judgements,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.560
either of them reflect rigid gender norms with proper patriarchy.

00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:06.061
So my point is not that is not selfish either way.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.640
It's not to judge either way

00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:10.201
because either way

00:02:10.202 --> 00:02:15.741
you are perpetrating patriarchy through proper government,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:24.040
rigid gender roles and believing that someone's uterus is political

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:26.901
and key to solving an external

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.360
social and environmental problem.

00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:32.781
The women are then in what is called a double bind

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.240
where it doesn't matter what choice you make,

00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:38.241
you're not free. I believe that at its core,

00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:43.021
these judgments reflect a desire to control our bodies.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.580
So if you're pro, pro choice,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.660
then you should be pro choice.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.940
If you're pro choice,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.500
then you shouldn't be saying having kids is selfish

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.060
because you might as well be saying having an abortion is selfish.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.800
And I don't know, maybe you do believe that.

00:02:57.801 --> 00:02:59.241
But if you're pro choice,

00:02:59.242 --> 00:03:03.461
you have to take into consideration what that means morally.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.340
And that means free to make a choice without that type of judgement.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.020
Stop holding women and people with uteruses

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.520
accountable for societal problems.

00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:16.161
We should be holding governments

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:21.161
and large resource companies accountable for climate change,

00:03:21.162 --> 00:03:24.761
not women and people on an individual level.

00:03:24.762 --> 00:03:26.861
If you really think that judging women

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.280
for having a baby is gonna solve climate change,

00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:34.881
it's the same as people thinking that controlling women's right

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:39.301
To abortion is going to solve the economy.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.260
You need to look closer

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.860
because it sounds like you just wanna control women.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.000
You wanna continue to control our agency

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:49.121
and make sure that we exist in a,

00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:51.108
a bind where we can never win.
