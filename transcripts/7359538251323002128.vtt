The most relatable thing about the new Taylor Swift album

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:13.140
is that the two month situationship was more of a stab in the guts

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.960
than the six year relationship.

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:17.421
We've all been there, babe.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.360
It makes no sense at all. Yet it makes so much sense. Anyway,

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:27.401
what I really wanna talk about is, um,

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:30.061
this message that I got from Abdul

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.180
whose family would like to leave and

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.080
they really need your help.

00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:41.861
You probably seen this. This family really need to get out.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.000
I just don't understand how there are billionaires

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.001
who don't just go through every single one of these links

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:48.621
and top up all the crowd funds.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.500
But there's not clearly, or they would have. Um,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.740
a lot of people sharing this. It's really legit.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.200
The borders are closing really,

00:00:58.201 --> 00:00:59.181
really soon.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.440
They're almost halfway there.

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.041
So, um,

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.121
we just really need to get this over the line.

00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:07.601
Please repost this, share this,

00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:10.081
donate, do whatever you can.

00:01:10.082 --> 00:01:10.941
Um,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.000
just think about what you wanna be able to tell your grandchildren

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:17.461
you were doing at this time.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.320
I put the name of the page down here. Um,

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:26.381
and I put a link in the comments as well.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.540
Um, and yeah,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.300
sending love.
