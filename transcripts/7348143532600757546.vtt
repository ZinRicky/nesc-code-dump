00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.600
I just stopped a near parenting disaster okay

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.880
I'm dropping my kids off for their math class

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:06.400
and my daughter has a water bottle

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:07.040
and I look at it

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:09.320
and I see her crawling out of the car out of the corner of my eye

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:10.000
and I was like huh

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:11.240
what water bottle is that

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:13.020
and she shows me which one it is

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.600
and I was like

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:14.500
oh no baby

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.980
you can't take that

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.920
you can use it at home

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:20.980
can't take it to a place with other children or other adults

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.380
this is the water bottle

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.420
can you imagine

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.180
the questions or the call I would have gotten if she had taken that in with her

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.180
oh my god
