00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.660
We know that Manitoba children,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.400
regardless of their background,

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:07.741
do best when they are connected to their families and communities.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.140
For many decades, indigenous peoples have been blocked

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.660
from being able to provide this care.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.540
But together with indigenous leaders,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.120
we are writing a historic wrong

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:23.241
and taking a major step towards investing in strong

00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:25.461
family and community connections.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.340
I'm really excited to announce today that as of October 1st,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.540
our government has amended Manitoba's Child and Family Services Act

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.740
to introduce four new agreement types

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.020
to fundamentally reshape child welfare here in Manitoba.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.780
These new agreements,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.540
family support, kinship care,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.220
customary care and voluntary care,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.200
means more options are available

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:05.221
to keep children out of the child welfare system

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.700
while keeping their parents actively involved in planning

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.560
for their own children.

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:14.921
I am glad to see that parents will retain guardianship

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:16.421
with these new agreements.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.640
Parents will continue to exercise their rights as parents.

00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:24.641
Our families need to be supported through our own customary laws,

00:01:24.642 --> 00:01:27.621
traditions, not through the court system.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.300
You know, and I thought I would get my kids back in a year,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.460
two years,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.860
five years, 10 years.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.740
It still didn't happen.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.560
And yet I had, I had individuals,

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:45.761
people in power and professionals who had confidence in my parenting.

00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:47.821
I just need a little bit of support.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.160
There is nothing more damaging to a mother,

00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:55.341
to a parent then taking away your children.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.280
I know that first hand in my own personal life and the effects.

00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:05.101
Of having been in child welfare and what that did to my own mother,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.200
which ultimately ended up,

00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:10.541
you know, losing her life to drug overdose.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.880
What we proclaimed on October 1st

00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:17.301
and the path that we are currently on here in Manitoba

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.300
of customary and kinship care agreements

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.240
keeps children with their,

00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:24.541
their families

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.940
and keeps parents involved in the well being of their children.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.120
That is fundamentally decolonizing work.

00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:36.201
And so my message to families and to parents

00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:39.481
is that we are here to work with you.

00:02:39.482 --> 00:02:41.081
And I know that our partners

00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:45.410
and stakeholders are here to work with families as well.
