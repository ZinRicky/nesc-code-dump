My mom introduced me to an organic makeup about a year ago called OG,

00:05.641 --> 00:07.801
and I use it every single day.

00:07.802 --> 00:11.481
So first what I do is I use their sculpted complexion stick,

00:11.482 --> 00:14.301
and I just put that in the areas that need a little attention.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.160
I blend that in,

00:15.161 --> 00:17.681
and then I use their contour collection set,

00:17.682 --> 00:18.601
which is three colors.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.781
It has the bronzer,

00:20.040 --> 00:21.320
the rose color,

00:21.321 --> 00:23.301
and then it also has a.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.240
A shimmer highlighter that I put underneath my eyes

00:26.241 --> 00:27.581
in a few other places,

00:27.640 --> 00:28.440
and I love that.

00:28.441 --> 00:30.001
It just gives me a light,

00:30.002 --> 00:31.201
dewy look on the skin.

00:31.202 --> 00:32.101
It's my favorite.
