00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.560
Ron  Desantis is threatening to prosecute TV station

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:06.440
that air pro choice ads that he doesn't like

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:09.400
as if the First Amendment doesn't apply to him

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:11.000
first and most importantly

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.460
let's watch the ad that he's trying to ban

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.020
my first thought was am I gonna be able to see my daughter again

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.480
the doctors knew if I did not in my pregnancy

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:25.620
I would lose my baby I would lose my life

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.860
and my daughter would lose her mom

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.500
Florida has now banned abortion

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.700
even in cases like mine amendment for is gonna protect women like me

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.560
we have to vote yes the ad is encouraging voters to vote for amendment for

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:41.080
which would untried abortion rights into the state constitution

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:45.000
and Republicans know that abortion access is overwhelmingly popular

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.680
even among Republicans so they don't like ballot initiatives

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.880
because they generally need to keep the issue of abortion out of voters hands

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:54.800
every time abortion has been on the ballot

00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:59.160
even in red states voters have come out and said that they want abortion access

00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:01.680
so Desantis is doing everything possible to try to get in the way

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.720
he's spending taxpayer dollars to fight the amendment

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:09.060
he is sending out election police to interrogate and intimidate residents

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.920
and apparently now

00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:12.600
he is threatening to prosecute TV stations

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:15.240
that run ads to promote the amendment

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.760
the letter um

00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:19.040
claims that the ad spreads false

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:20.440
dangerous information

00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:24.840
because Florida's six week abortion ban actually does not pose any health risks

00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:26.620
to women I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.760
oh my god

00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:32.880
forcing women to carry unwanted pregnancies is incredibly dangerous

00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:37.000
maternal mortality in abortion ban states is skyrocketing

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:38.720
see what the letter is saying is no

00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:39.480
actually see

00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:40.960
we have these exceptions for

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:44.880
to save the life of the woman or if she's at serious risk of substantial

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:46.960
irreversible physical impairment

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.640
as I and physicians all over the country have explained

00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:51.360
is you can't legislate on healthcare

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.360
you can't say well

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:54.100
you can treat someone if they're on

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.520
you know if it's to save their life

00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:56.080
it's like what

00:01:56.081 --> 00:02:01.040
what point is that do we need to wait until women go into organ failure

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:03.120
do we need to wait until they go into septic shock

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.120
do we have to try organ transplants first

00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:06.800
like this doesn't make any sense

00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:09.320
and in Florida if a doctor gets it wrong

00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:11.040
they face five years in prison

00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:14.520
physicians are understandably reluctant to provide care in the state of Florida

00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:16.320
because they are risking prosecution

00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:19.160
and having the state disagree with their medical judgment

00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:20.240
the state basically saying well

00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:22.800
she wasn't sick enough yet to qualify for the exception

00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:23.920
every time I explain this

00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:25.400
I'm like this is so insane

00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:28.400
what really makes me wanna just send myself to the moon is in this letter

00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:29.200
they're like you know

00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:32.480
because of your ad women may believe that treatments are available in Florida

00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:35.620
so they might travel out of state and not get care here

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.560
oh my god

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:38.620
oh my god

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.920
you guys are threatening physicians with five years in prison

00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:46.240
if they provide an abortion that you don't like

00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:50.600
you are the reason that Florida residents are in danger

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:55.280
their life is in danger and that they are being sent out of state for care

00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:56.800
before I digress even further

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.040
um in the United States

00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:00.000
we have something called the First Amendment

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.200
the government doesn't get to pick and choose

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.000
and regulate speech it doesn't like

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.840
Rhonda Santos doesn't get to threaten to prosecute TV stations

00:03:08.841 --> 00:03:10.520
for running ads he doesn't like

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:14.040
Republican efforts to keep the issue of abortion out of voters hands

00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:15.040
and doing things like this

00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.200
threatening to prosecute um

00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:19.240
speech that it doesn't like

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:24.000
all of this is emblematic of how attacks on abortion are attacks on democracy

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:25.200
if you wanna learn more about this

00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:27.360
I cannot recommend Jessica Valentie enough

00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:29.120
and her new book is out on abortion

00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:30.360
I highly recommend getting it

00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:31.920
there's so much more I could say about this

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:33.180
um but for now

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.920
let me know what questions that you have

00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:37.663
I'm the feminist lawyer follow me if you enjoy being miserable
