00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.400
Guys, this is a good comment,

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.921
so don't hate on her for asking.

00:00:02.922 --> 00:00:04.401
She says, what happens when,

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:06.881
just like your boss, he finds you no longer valuable?

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:08.201
She's talking about my husband.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:09.841
We've all heard the horror stories of men

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.561
leaving their wives with absolutely nothing

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:14.641
when all they've done is stay home for decades raising children.

00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:16.401
The truth is, the statistics now

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:20.281
is that 70 to 80% of all divorces are initiated by women.

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:24.041
And that number goes up to 90% if they are college educated

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:25.841
or have a degree. This is important

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:28.121
because I feel like there's a lot of fear mongering

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:29.321
when it comes to marriage

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:30.881
and becoming a stay at home mom

00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:32.841
because we feel like we're putting down our lives

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:34.281
and we're ruining our resumes

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:38.241
and there's nothing we can go back to when if the man pulls the plug.

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:42.521
But the truth is, it's really unjustified to even have that fear

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:45.481
when it's really women that are leaving the most marriages,

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:46.801
not men. Now, yes,

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:48.681
I have heard of men, you know,

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.741
sometimes taking everything from a woman.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.640
A lot of the times it's they cheated

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:56.241
and it's still the woman who's initiating the divorce,

00:00:56.242 --> 00:00:59.121
not the man. I think there's also way to be smart about this.

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:00.681
I got a degree very young

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:03.961
and my parents knew that I wanted to be a wife and a mom.

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:07.801
And I just got the degree to have in my pocket now.

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:10.361
Yes, that's a Safety net that most of us want or desire.

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.361
But the truth is, if you pick a good man from the beginning,

00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:14.721
then none of this is an issue.

00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:17.081
It's all a meet point. At the end of the day,

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:18.761
there are so many more women

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:21.561
that take almost everything that a man works for

00:01:21.562 --> 00:01:23.561
and they take his children and his home.

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:24.841
I live in a communal state.

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:26.641
We Teeter taught between Mexico and Texas.

00:01:26.642 --> 00:01:28.521
And let me tell you, at the end of the day,

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:30.441
almost every judge is gonna side with me.

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:32.481
Quite frankly, I don't think that's completely fair.

00:01:32.482 --> 00:01:34.841
Especially when women are leaving marriages

00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:37.761
because they just don't feel satisfied anymore

00:01:37.762 --> 00:01:39.721
or emotionally. There.

00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:41.401
I have a ton of other videos on this.

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:43.481
Go scroll my page. But at the end of the day,

00:01:43.482 --> 00:01:46.001
women are way more protected than men.

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:46.961
And this fear mongering

00:01:46.962 --> 00:01:50.021
we have around being a stay at home mom and a wife

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.280
is really, again,

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:52.641
just unjustified. Again,

00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:54.201
I've seen some in real life,

00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:55.161
but for the most part

00:01:55.162 --> 00:01:58.801
this is really coming from Hollywood and bad rap songs.

00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:01.641
There's also things that you can do to be very smart about this.

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:04.521
My husband's building a business and he will make me an employee of it.

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:06.761
When I am 65, I will qualify for Medicare,

00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:10.241
Social Security, and all the things that a normal working person would.

00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:12.561
You live in a communal state like New Mexico or Texas.

00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:14.441
Guess what You already are entitled

00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:17.161
to half of what y'all come into the marriage with

00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:21.641
and build together. I have never once felt endangered in my marriage

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.881
if he even was to consider leaving me.

00:02:23.882 --> 00:02:26.001
But again, back to my main point.

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:30.541
The main reason we have all this bad narrative about men

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.740
is because women don't choose the right ones

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.080
at heart, and I'm speaking from experience.

00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:40.041
We're a little bit toxic. Want the toxic love and the UPS and the downs.

00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:42.921
And then we sometimes get pregnant by men that we shouldn't,

00:02:42.922 --> 00:02:45.881
and we merge our lives with someone that we shouldn't.

00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:49.881
I bow my knee to him only because I know who he bows his knee to.

00:02:49.882 --> 00:02:51.801
Find a good man, find an honorable man,

00:02:51.802 --> 00:02:53.001
and you won't have these issues.

00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:54.081
But at the end of the day,

00:02:54.082 --> 00:02:56.201
we look past 90% of the good men.

00:02:56.202 --> 00:02:58.281
I know that truth stings a little bit,

00:02:58.282 --> 00:02:59.881
but it's something that I had to realize,

00:02:59.882 --> 00:03:01.781
too, as I was getting older into my thirties.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.520
So with that said, thank you for this comment.

00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:05.601
I absolutely don't blame you for asking.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:09.041
I explain this a lot to my nieces and the younger women around me.

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:09.441
Sometimes

00:03:09.442 --> 00:03:12.481
we just have to sit back and look at how truly indoctrinated we are

00:03:12.482 --> 00:03:14.261
as a society and as a culture

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.611
that makes women fear a relationship in a nuclear family so much.
