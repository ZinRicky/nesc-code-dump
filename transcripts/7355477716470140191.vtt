00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.220
Clothes not being in every single person size

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.160
is very much of this video off by saying,

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:07.841
I really do like and respect Leah,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.880
I do think that this video shows a very fundamental misunderstanding

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:11.601
of what the actual

00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:13.681
issue is. So I want to push back at some of the points that you made.

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.401
I hope you can understand where I'm coming from.

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:16.401
Show this video off by saying,

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:18.361
not every brand needs to make everything for everyone.

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:19.161
And on the surface, yes,

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:22.121
I agree. But this push for inclusivity is not about one specific brand.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.061
It's about brands as a whole

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.560
being more inclusive and including more people in their size ranges.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:28.961
You say if a brand doesn't have your size,

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.681
to go where they have your size,

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:31.801
but, like, that's the problem.

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:32.961
We don't have that option.

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:34.241
I can count on my fingers

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:38.241
what stores actually make plus size clothes that are available to me.

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:40.361
I can't shop at a place that doesn't exist.

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:41.201
List of places that I

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:43.401
can shop at has definitely increased over the years,

00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:46.441
but it is still not nearly close enough to reflect

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:48.801
the actual population of plus size people in this country.

00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:51.241
Two thirds of United States women are considered plus size.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:53.841
Like, the average clothing size is a 1618,

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:57.061
meaning the average women cannot shop at stores.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.800
Out of all clothing brands in the United States,

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.281
only 19% of them carry plus sizes.

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:02.721
And of those 19%,

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:05.321
the majority only up To a 3 x.

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:07.641
So there's an even smaller amount of, like,

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:09.361
companies that carry above a size 3 x.

00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:09.921
Last I checked,

00:01:09.922 --> 00:01:13.621
between 66 and 72% of United States women are considered plus size.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.480
This lack and gap of available clothing doesn't affect, like,

00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:18.561
a small group of people.

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:20.001
This is a very millions.

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:21.441
Millions of women are affected by this.

00:01:21.442 --> 00:01:23.361
Compare it to being a size 16 shoe, and, like,

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:24.761
obviously you're not gonna get mad

00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:26.521
at companies who don't cater to your shoe size,

00:01:26.522 --> 00:01:27.361
but it's a false equivalent

00:01:27.362 --> 00:01:29.281
because a sheer amount of people that are affected

00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:31.641
by the lack of sizing is, like, much,

00:01:31.642 --> 00:01:33.841
much greater. Last fashion week, I had a similar conversation.

00:01:33.842 --> 00:01:34.521
I was talking to someone

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:37.181
who said that they thought that brands were forced to be inclusive.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.760
Um, like,

00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:39.001
that's just not the reality.

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.761
Fashion Week point nine % of the models were plus size.

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:44.081
And again, that's the smallest end of plus sizes.

00:01:44.082 --> 00:01:45.481
Not even a full percent of the models.

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:49.281
And 99, over 99% of the models were straight size.

00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:49.921
They were skinny.

00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:52.041
No one is being forced to do anything.

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:55.081
Push towards inclusivity is happening from consumers

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:57.761
because we're telling companies what we want and what we need.

00:01:57.762 --> 00:01:59.361
But, like, there's no gun to anyone's head.

00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:00.801
Like, at that is ultimately their choice

00:02:00.802 --> 00:02:03.321
just as much as our choice and prerogative

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.321
to be able to speak about it.

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:07.001
And I think because it's a conversation that we have primarily online,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.880
A perception that we have access to much more than we actually do.

00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:10.761
But when you look at this,

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:12.721
when you look at the less than 1% of models were plus,

00:02:12.722 --> 00:02:14.641
and that less than 19% of clothing retail,

00:02:14.642 --> 00:02:15.081
supposedly

00:02:15.082 --> 00:02:17.841
supposed to cater to two thirds of the entire population of women,

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:19.921
how that number has been decreasing since covid,

00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:21.161
we see that just not the case.

00:02:21.162 --> 00:02:22.521
Still not being included again.

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:23.521
So I'm a follower of yours,

00:02:23.522 --> 00:02:25.081
so I know that you previously were fat,

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:26.281
and you put a lot of work into it,

00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:28.881
and you care very much about maintaining a certain,

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:30.241
you know, look now.

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:31.601
And your body and your health are very important to you,

00:02:31.602 --> 00:02:33.081
which is totally awesome for you.

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:34.121
I'm in no way criticizing.

00:02:34.122 --> 00:02:35.801
Think everyone should be able to do what they want with their body.

00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:36.481
That being said,

00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:37.681
that the clothes weren't flattering.

00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:38.961
It was a body that was a flatter,

00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:40.641
which obviously I can't change your opinion on your body.

00:02:40.642 --> 00:02:41.961
As a person with a fat body,

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:43.641
some people may think is unflattering.

00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:46.161
Can tell you that there are still clothes that look good

00:02:46.162 --> 00:02:47.761
and are flattering on my body.

00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:51.041
And there's a very big difference between the way that I look and feel

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:52.761
are created with a fat body in mind.

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:54.801
The way that I feel with clothes are ill fitting

00:02:54.802 --> 00:02:56.661
and not made with fat bodies in mind.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.080
With your personal journey to weight loss,

00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:00.441
you no longer feel The effects of fat phobia.

00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:02.161
And you may think that's a solution for everyone,

00:03:02.162 --> 00:03:05.241
it's not. Even if tomorrow every single person on the planet decided,

00:03:05.242 --> 00:03:05.961
I'm gonna lose weight,

00:03:05.962 --> 00:03:07.041
I'm gonna go on weight loss journey,

00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:08.121
people would still be fat.

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:09.801
And what are they supposed to do in the meantime?

00:03:09.802 --> 00:03:11.281
The time when we have conversations about fat people,

00:03:11.282 --> 00:03:12.241
the dominant narrative,

00:03:12.242 --> 00:03:14.241
if we are talking about fatphobia,

00:03:14.242 --> 00:03:15.721
we experience is to just lose weight,

00:03:15.722 --> 00:03:16.801
and then that phobia will disappear.

00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:19.441
And we also may save an individual from experiencing fatphobia.

00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:21.161
But it doesn't change the lived experience

00:03:21.162 --> 00:03:22.601
for every other fat person on the planet.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.481
It doesn't change the fact that there are still fat people that exist.

00:03:25.482 --> 00:03:27.721
There are still fat people that deserve to wear clothes

00:03:27.722 --> 00:03:28.521
that make them feel good.

00:03:28.522 --> 00:03:31.241
You shouldn't have to lose weight to have access to clothes.

00:03:31.242 --> 00:03:33.881
I'm not saying every single brand needs to include up,

00:03:33.882 --> 00:03:38.161
but also more brands than currently do should also make sizes for us.

00:03:38.162 --> 00:03:40.121
A lot of time people are talking about department store,

00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:41.121
not like luxury brand.

00:03:41.122 --> 00:03:41.961
Like, obviously, again,

00:03:41.962 --> 00:03:43.481
they're all included in the same conversation.

00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:44.321
I live in New York City,

00:03:44.322 --> 00:03:45.441
right? The center of everything.

00:03:45.442 --> 00:03:47.121
There are three stores in the city.

00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:48.961
If I had to put clothing on my body,

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:50.641
does not even my style,

00:03:50.642 --> 00:03:51.681
just clothing on my body,

00:03:51.682 --> 00:03:53.281
I would be able to go out and buy that.

00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:55.361
You say being a human being is a beautiful thing.

00:03:55.362 --> 00:03:57.321
And we shouldn't waste our time with useless nonsense.

00:03:57.322 --> 00:03:59.921
But I'll push back and say to me, fashion isn't useless.

00:03:59.922 --> 00:04:01.361
It may be a minute thing to you,

00:04:01.362 --> 00:04:02.881
but as someone who spent my entire adolescence

00:04:02.882 --> 00:04:04.281
shopping at Macy's and Walmart,

00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:07.681
buying ugly, ill fitting clothing that further isolated me from my peer,

00:04:07.682 --> 00:04:08.801
that reminded me every single day

00:04:08.802 --> 00:04:09.961
that I was different from everyone else

00:04:09.962 --> 00:04:11.881
and constantly made me feel like there was something wrong with.

00:04:11.882 --> 00:04:13.161
That wasn't a small thing.

00:04:13.162 --> 00:04:14.681
First time I stepped into a tour

00:04:14.682 --> 00:04:17.961
and bought a bra that I thought was cute and fashionable and trend,

00:04:17.962 --> 00:04:19.561
I cried in that dressing room.

00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:22.601
Memory of that experience is like a flash bulb in my mind

00:04:22.602 --> 00:04:23.801
because it was so impactful.

00:04:23.802 --> 00:04:24.681
Because my entire life

00:04:24.682 --> 00:04:27.601
I had gone without feeling good in the clothes that I wore.

00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:30.761
And finally we're at a point where there is more options,

00:04:30.762 --> 00:04:33.321
yes, for inclusive sizing. Again, it's.

00:04:33.322 --> 00:04:34.681
It's still a very small amount.

00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:37.121
Getting access to clothing that fit me and I thought was cute,

00:04:37.122 --> 00:04:38.281
fundamentally change my life.

00:04:38.282 --> 00:04:39.601
Cause the way that I move to the world,

00:04:39.602 --> 00:04:42.521
the way that I feel about my body is impacted by the clothes I wear.

00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:44.601
Because if I'm leaving the house in an outfit that I feel good

00:04:44.602 --> 00:04:45.881
and that I feel stylish in,

00:04:45.882 --> 00:04:46.721
that I feel fashionably,

00:04:46.722 --> 00:04:49.921
I feel more confident and happy in my being able to wear clothes

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.401
that make you feel good about yourself.

00:04:51.402 --> 00:04:52.561
I don't think It's a small thing.

00:04:52.562 --> 00:04:55.781
It took me a long time to get to a point in my life where I'm

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.680
comfortable in my body

00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:57.961
and I don't hate myself

00:04:57.962 --> 00:04:59.401
and hate what I see in the mirror every single day.

00:04:59.402 --> 00:05:00.761
Was the way that I dress

00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:04.201
and finally being able to start wearing clothing that I,

00:05:04.202 --> 00:05:05.201
you know, I think is cute.

00:05:05.202 --> 00:05:06.321
That's only been able to happen

00:05:06.322 --> 00:05:08.081
because of this push towards inclusivity.

00:05:08.082 --> 00:05:09.801
But again, the options that we have are very limited.

00:05:09.802 --> 00:05:11.441
I'm able to make it work with what we have,

00:05:11.442 --> 00:05:12.561
but it takes a lot of time,

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:16.881
money, and privilege to be able to be fat and look cute and, like,

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:17.601
be fashionable.

00:05:17.602 --> 00:05:19.801
That should be something that I think everyone deserves access to.

00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:21.121
It's not just about the clothes.

00:05:21.122 --> 00:05:22.301
It's about, like,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.480
being humanized,

00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:25.761
but being seen and being considered as people.

00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:27.521
You know, when I go shopping with my thin friends

00:05:27.522 --> 00:05:29.881
and I enter a store that doesn't have my side,

00:05:29.882 --> 00:05:31.241
I'm not gonna say anything,

00:05:31.242 --> 00:05:32.521
but when I walk into the store,

00:05:32.522 --> 00:05:34.521
I am reminded that I am not considered,

00:05:34.522 --> 00:05:35.801
not wanted, and not welcome.

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.881
Looks well. I do shop at

00:05:37.882 --> 00:05:41.041
and support the companies that do support me and make clothes for me.

00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:43.641
I don't think it's wrong to want more and to desire more,

00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:45.401
and to think that, at the very least,

00:05:45.402 --> 00:05:46.681
the fashion industry as it exists

00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:49.241
should be more reflective of the average consumer,

00:05:49.242 --> 00:05:51.121
because ultimately, these brands are Not your friend.

00:05:51.122 --> 00:05:52.441
Their only purpose is to make money,

00:05:52.442 --> 00:05:54.061
and they don't need you to defend them.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.200
They're going to become more inclusive and listen to

00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:58.281
or saying is because we're bitching about it.

00:05:58.282 --> 00:05:59.321
Then, like, sorry,

00:05:59.322 --> 00:06:00.081
that's working.

00:06:00.082 --> 00:06:02.241
I think the lived experience of fat people

00:06:02.242 --> 00:06:04.081
should be considered more than

00:06:04.082 --> 00:06:05.641
the feelings of a few corporations.

00:06:05.642 --> 00:06:06.561
And unless we push forward,

00:06:06.562 --> 00:06:07.361
it's not gonna happen.

00:06:07.362 --> 00:06:09.681
Which I hope I was able to give you some perspective and, like,

00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:11.681
understanding of the issue as a whole

00:06:11.682 --> 00:06:14.001
and why we care so much about pushing for inclusivity

00:06:14.002 --> 00:06:15.561
and why it matters so much to us.

00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:16.481
I do really respect you.

00:06:16.482 --> 00:06:18.481
I just. This take I had to push back on.

00:06:18.482 --> 00:06:19.481
This video was educational,

00:06:19.482 --> 00:06:20.601
informative, help, just, like,

00:06:20.602 --> 00:06:22.041
you know, give you my perfect.

00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:23.961
Also, I am more than willing to talk about this more.

00:06:23.962 --> 00:06:25.741
I understand that not everybody,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.720
you know, engages in fat politics,

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:28.841
so you might have

00:06:28.842 --> 00:06:30.681
spend a lot of time researching and talking about them.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:31.641
More than willing to,

00:06:31.642 --> 00:06:32.921
you know, give you my perspective,

00:06:32.922 --> 00:06:35.401
to talk and to educate if you are willing to listen.

00:06:35.402 --> 00:06:36.041
And that goes for everyone.

00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:37.321
I'm sorry it's such a long video,

00:06:37.322 --> 00:06:40.121
but, like, if you have any questions and you are respectful about them,

00:06:40.122 --> 00:06:41.721
I would be more than happy to, like,

00:06:41.722 --> 00:06:43.201
give you more information and,

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:43.841
you know, my perspective.

00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:47.921
I hope the comments are respectful and understanding and empathetic,

00:06:47.922 --> 00:06:49.201
and I hope you guys are Open enough to,

00:06:49.202 --> 00:06:49.841
you know, maybe

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:51.823
see a different perspective that you didn't agree with previously.
