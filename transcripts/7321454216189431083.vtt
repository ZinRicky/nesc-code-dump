00:00.080 --> 00:02.000
My dad hopped on a 10 hour flight

00:02.000 --> 00:03.080
all the way from Germany

00:03.080 --> 00:06.020
to spend the next two weeks with me and the babies.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.320
Lucky's out of town for two weeks,

00:08.320 --> 00:09.600
but maybe even two months.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.640
We don't know yet.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.440
So since my dad arrived the night before,

00:12.440 --> 00:15.120
he stocked me up on my favorite treats and snacks,

00:15.120 --> 00:17.060
and also some German flour.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.520
First thing I did was make myself some tea.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.640
He also brought all of my favorite tea,

00:21.640 --> 00:23.800
so I obviously had to use that.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.300
And then it was time to make some breakfast.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.680
Since I had this flower,

00:27.680 --> 00:29.800
I decided to make a super nostalgic

00:29.800 --> 00:31.360
pancake recipe to us.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.320
I had this all the time growing up,

00:33.320 --> 00:36.320
so it felt good having it again after a while.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.320
I usually put applesauce on these pancakes.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.280
Sometimes jam,

00:40.280 --> 00:41.700
but usually applesauce.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.160
So I made the kids one,

00:43.160 --> 00:43.880
rolled it up,

00:43.880 --> 00:47.160
and then they also had some clementines with that

00:47.160 --> 00:48.520
while they were having their breakfast.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.200
I made myself some breakfast

00:50.200 --> 00:52.240
and then also did my morning scriptures,

00:52.240 --> 00:53.280
wrote my to do list,

00:53.280 --> 00:54.360
did my journaling,

00:54.360 --> 00:56.960
and also updated a few substack things.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.680
This part of my morning is so crucial

00:58.680 --> 00:59.760
because if I don't do it,

00:59.760 --> 01:02.080
it feels like I'm kind of behind in a way.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.120
I don't know what it is.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.200
And then I went upstairs,

01:04.200 --> 01:05.160
did my skincare.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.240
I could not talk about this hyaluronic

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
acid serum enough.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.460
It's so good.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.760
I also ran out of my Favorite facial oil,

01:11.760 --> 01:13.200
which is always a bad sign

01:13.200 --> 01:15.120
because my skin is always kind of dry when I

01:15.120 --> 01:16.040
don't use it.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.680
Hopped on my jewelry for the day

01:17.680 --> 01:19.200
and then started on my hair.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.340
Halfway through

01:20.680 --> 01:22.600
people came to pick up our Christmas tree

01:22.600 --> 01:24.300
cause it was time for it to go.

01:24.440 --> 01:26.660
My dad did not wanna pay these guys.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.280
I think it's the German in him.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.480
So he suggested going to Home Depot

01:30.480 --> 01:32.320
and getting a saw to do it ourselves,

01:32.320 --> 01:33.840
but I just couldn't be bothered with that,

01:33.840 --> 01:35.460
so I just let them pick it up.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.360
And then made the bed,

01:37.360 --> 01:38.120
got dressed,

01:38.120 --> 01:39.920
and then we had errands to run,

01:39.920 --> 01:42.240
so I obviously had to get the kids dressed

01:42.240 --> 01:43.040
and in the car,

01:43.040 --> 01:44.440
which is always a struggle,

01:44.440 --> 01:45.580
but we made it.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.920
The first stop was FedEx to.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.580
Actually I think it was UPS

01:49.640 --> 01:51.320
to drop off a package.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.600
And then we went to target

01:52.600 --> 01:53.840
because I didn't realize that it

01:53.840 --> 01:55.420
was Slim's birthday tomorrow

01:55.640 --> 01:57.480
and I hadn't gotten anything yet.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.240
I'm also the most indecisive person,

01:59.240 --> 02:00.600
so this took quite a while.

02:00.600 --> 02:01.880
But I got some wrapping paper

02:01.880 --> 02:03.500
that I thought was really cute.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.560
And then our last stop was Whole Foods.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.040
I just picked up some essentials.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.160
I didn't do a full on groceries shop.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.320
Also, this is my favorite gluten free pasta.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.640
And then also this.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.460
Smoked sea salt is the best on tomatoes.
