00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.960
Okay, I don't know.

00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:03.601
I don't know if you watch that Ashley Madison fucking show,

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:05.441
but I binged it cause I remember that shit.

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:06.321
I remember that shit.

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:10.361
I remember that fucking YouTube couple with their fucking frozen song.

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:14.481
And he fucking swears to god that he took piss out of the toilet.

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:17.241
Like, diluted piss out of the toilet.

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:18.521
And he told her she was pregnant.

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:21.381
Like, they are just still fucking,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.220
like, calm the fuck on.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:33.880
But I loved it because for all the young women who think,

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:35.561
my husband would never do that,

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:37.361
no, we have a loving marriage.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:38.401
No, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:42.961
All the shit that this cute little woman is saying,

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:43.681
you know what I mean?

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:46.481
I'm. It sucks that she fucking stayed with him.

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:49.141
Sounds like he put her through the fucking ringer.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.640
He's gonna do it again, probably.

00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:53.641
Or at some point in his life he's gonna be like,

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:54.201
you know what?

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:55.661
I just can't like.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.160
Like

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.120
when someone shows you who they are,

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:03.641
fucking believe them.

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:05.121
Believe them in every way.

00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:06.841
When someone shows you they're a good person,

00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:07.761
they like, oh,

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:08.921
a little bit of vulnerability.

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:11.061
Cling to that and like, okay.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.980
But when they flip that shit and show you that they're a piece of shit,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.800
like, oh, my god,

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:19.781
oh, my god, oh, my god.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.240
That shit was like,

00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:24.381
I'm just.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.640
It's just so validating.

00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:28.081
It's so. That's what it is.

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:32.021
It's so fucking validating, because I'm like, Okay,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.640
so she chose a different route.

00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:36.601
She decided to stay with him and work on her marriage.

00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:37.761
And what does that get her?

00:01:37.762 --> 00:01:41.821
A lifetime of every fucking memory they have is tainted with

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.540
if he ate some other girl's pussy.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.660
He was fucking digging some other bitch out.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.960
And then you're just gonna be like, sitting by the pool happy with him.

00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:55.641
Mia, I hope you fucking see this.

00:01:55.642 --> 00:01:56.801
I hope you fucking see this.

00:01:56.802 --> 00:01:57.721
Cause then I looked it up

00:01:57.722 --> 00:01:58.161
and then

00:01:58.162 --> 00:02:00.441
they're still trying to get mad views on their fucking YouTube

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:01.821
using this shit. Like.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.860
Like maybe re.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.200
Like take a different fucking path on the journey sometimes.

00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:12.661
Oh my god, I'm just.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.500
That couple blows my fucking mind and.
