00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
I got this bag from the TikTok shop,

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:03.161
and I just got back from the grocery store.

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:06.541
And I want to show you how much shit is in this bag. Look,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.040
this is my heavy shit bag.

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:09.841
Look.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.920
Glass bottle. Kombucha.

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:12.721
Tastes like shit,

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:14.141
but it's good for your gut.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.200
Salad dressing,

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:18.581
hard, heavy shit.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.020
More heavy shit.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.560
These fucking teas are delicious,

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:26.101
but this is all heavy shit.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.080
Heavy,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.020
heavy.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.300
Check this shit out.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.900
Boom! And a gallon of milk in this fucking bag.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.180
In Colorado, we.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.680
Plastic bags are illegal.

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:41.081
They don't even sell them at the fucking grocery store.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.281
You need something like this.

00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:43.541
And this shit is.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.360
I initially was like,

00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:45.241
I wanna go to the beach.

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:46.201
My ass is in Colorado.

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:47.041
I'm not going to the beach.

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.421
This shit perfect for the grocery store.
