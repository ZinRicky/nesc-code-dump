00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.920
So I got a lot of questions about our Greek mythology unit,

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:05.721
and we're about to start another round of Greek mythology unit

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:07.281
because the kids were loving it so much,

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:08.921
so I wanted to show you some of the resources

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:10.621
that I use to put it together.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.520
The first thing I used was this Greek Mythology Unit study

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:16.381
that I got from Teachers Pay Teachers.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.080
It is by Nicole Shelby, and it's for third and fourth grade.

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:22.841
It comes with great instructions for the teacher of how to,

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:24.321
you know, decorate your room,

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:25.861
how to go through the unit,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.140
and then some close reading passages.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.240
Um, this is one we did about all the Greek gods.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.081
We don't always do it written down.

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:35.481
We do a lot of discussion work.

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:37.001
So, as you can see,

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.081
we did Hera,

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:41.401
but we ended up writing a lot of stuff during our discussion.

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:43.841
I always have written resources as well,

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:46.421
like physical books that I teach from.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.500
Oh, they're my daughter's drawings of Athena and Hera.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.200
I found this one in Barnes and noble,

00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:53.861
and it was really great. It has kind of, um,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.240
a lot of the ancient art as well that the kids can look at.

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:00.001
Our local library, we found these.

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:04.981
Choose your adventure based on Greek mythology. Perseus, um,

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.540
Hades and the Olympians, first Titans,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.360
as well as a book on Athena,

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:12.321
which ended up being my daughter's favorite.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:14.881
So with homeschooling, it's really important to find a Balance.

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:17.121
So we did this unit study, um,

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:20.341
this was really heavy on social studies and ELA,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.000
so we didn't really do tons of math or science with it.

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.081
The important thing for us

00:01:25.082 --> 00:01:28.201
then is to focus on those subjects for the following week

00:01:28.202 --> 00:01:29.321
to make sure we're balancing out

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.641
how much they're getting exposed to all the curriculum.

00:01:31.642 --> 00:01:35.081
Right now, we are doing a math unit on financial literacy.

00:01:35.082 --> 00:01:37.841
I have a book that we got off Amazon

00:01:37.842 --> 00:01:40.561
that's going through financial literacy lessons with the kids.

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:45.061
It is this one. And we are also starting back with our chemistry.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.760
But the great thing about homeschooling is

00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:47.521
you can lean in

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:49.601
when your kids are particularly interested in something.

00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:52.541
So although I didn't plan to continue on with Greek mythology,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.760
we are just about to start another unit on Greek mythology

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:59.381
in heroes and creatures and monsters.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760
And if you want another video about that unit,

00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:04.301
I would be happy to share my resources there, too.
