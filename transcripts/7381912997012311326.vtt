00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.280
One of the most important ways to convince people

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:03.001
that you're a chadwife

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.841
is by what you wear.

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:07.041
I found that if I can wear something really convincing,

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:09.301
people won't notice the holes in my cosplay.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.720
Since I don't have time to go clothes shopping myself,

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:12.841
I found a personal shopper

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:15.221
and gave her some descriptions of what I was looking for.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.920
Definitely 90s homeschooler,

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:19.021
Little House on the Prairie, and Amish.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.200
Then she chooses clothes in the size up from what I normally wear.

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.661
So looks frumpy on me.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.240
Sometimes we have to get it tailored just right for that perfect

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:29.601
frumpy look. My personal shopper charges $1,000 an hour,

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:31.561
but I don't actually need to hire her that often

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:34.741
cause I wear the same clothes over and over again in my videos.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.160
This communicates that I'm poor,

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.741
which makes people take pity on me and buy my e books.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.300
All in all, I think I've really succeeded the costumes for my content.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.340
My clothes are definitely a detail people comment on the most

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.880
and most people hate them.

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.641
But you know, that just gets me more engagement

00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:51.741
and in the end it funds my Jimmy Choo and Louis Vuitton obsession.
