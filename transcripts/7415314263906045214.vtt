00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.840
Another big perk of getting a fucking divorce

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.241
after being a stay at home mom

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:06.741
and then getting to have your own house.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.280
You get to design shit yourself.

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:13.641
Super fun to have your own shit and your own space.

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:15.921
I get to like put plants everywhere.

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.401
And I get to have my like

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:21.041
fucking bold pattern couch with my solid color pillows.

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:26.141
And like, I don't ask nobody's fucking permission for the shit.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.300
Do you know what I mean? I would have never.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.660
I just.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.040
I love it. I get to love my house,

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:37.321
I get to love my life. I get to be the mom I wanted to be.

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:41.221
I get to make the rules of the house. Like, I love this bear.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.440
It's not worth it to stay in a marriage just cause you have kids.

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:47.881
Because then

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:51.401
your kids don't even fucking get to know you for who you are.

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:53.081
So they grow up thinking you're one thing,

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:56.841
but you're not. And then they get to know you as their adults.

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:58.921
Like, I don't know,

00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:02.081
I just wasn't willing to sacrifice my whole entire life

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:03.841
because I suddenly became a wife.

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:06.021
If I didn't get to be a person,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.320
then I just. I'll leave that situation.

00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:10.011
And I fucking hope you do too.
