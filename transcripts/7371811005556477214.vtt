00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.120
What I eat in a day as a 22 year old tribewife.

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:06.821
So first off, I start the day on an empty stomach with some tincture.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.360
Then I'm gonna have my raw milk protein shake.

00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:10.761
I'm using just ingredients.

00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:13.821
Chai Protein powder is one of my current favorites.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.300
Then I'm gonna take my supplements.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.400
I've got some freeze dried bananas to take them with

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:21.461
because I cannot swallow pills.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.180
Then at lunchtime, I'm gonna make my just ingredients electrolyte drink.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.280
And then I'm gonna eat some tuna salad wrap with fresh tomatoes.

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:34.121
I tried to wrap it and I warmed up my tortillas too much,

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:36.381
so they just broke.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.320
I'm gonna have some ranch cottage cheese and carrots.

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:41.741
And then for supper, I'm having sourdough buns with barbecue beef,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.220
some potato salad and cauliflower.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.000
And then for dessert, I'm gonna have some leftover strawberry cobbler.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:49.561
That did not turn out like cobbler,

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:50.981
but hey, it was still good.
