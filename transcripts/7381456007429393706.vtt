00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.960
I know we talk about different phases of parenting and especially how hard like

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:05.000
the little years are

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.900
but there's something so rewarding

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.960
about when your kids get to an age where you can like

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:12.660
watch them thrive in an activity that they are talented in

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.280
we've tried a lot of activities as the kids were little

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.040
you know seeing what sticks

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:20.200
and we're finally at an age where each kid has found something that really

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:21.240
really like

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.560
they feel confident in

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:23.720
they love doing

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:24.320
and they're like

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:25.680
naturally talented at

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.760
and this is why I love like

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.080
the one week camp thing

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:29.600
it's inconvenient timing wise

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:32.040
but you get to try so many different types of activities

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:32.720
so for example

00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:34.520
my daughter last year did a theater camp

00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:35.280
and now she is like

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:36.120
super into Broadway

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:37.340
super into musicals

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.120
starting to do theater in the fall

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:42.960
and my son has really taken to skateboarding and skateboards with his dad

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:45.040
and we go to the skate park as a family

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:48.560
and I just love this phase of parenting and getting to see your kids like

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.020
become their own people

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.000
and although we look at activities as things that enhance our life

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.160
not define our life

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:57.460
it is really cool to watch them grow in their confidence and their interests
