00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
My phone is dead, as usual, and.

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:03.961
And then I remembered I have this amazing thing.

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:05.881
Look, it plugs into your car.

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:07.421
And outlets that all cars have.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.800
You can adjust it so even if it feels big and bulky,

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.341
it will fit in the space.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.060
This is my favorite part.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.380
The little cords are retractable,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.600
so you can pull it out and give it the slack,

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:21.681
so it's not like pulling.

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:23.761
I always feel like that's gonna damage my shit.

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:25.421
And it's got.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.320
It's got for apple,

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:29.201
for anything else,

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:31.701
and then it's got open spaces for other chargers.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.720
So even though I'm not an Uber driver,

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.401
I feel like an Uber driver. As a mama.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.701
For kids with their friends and their phones and their shit.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.780
And this thing helps us all survive.
