00:00.080 --> 00:01.400
It was way past our bedtime,

00:01.401 --> 00:03.361
but I needed a little late night snack,

00:03.362 --> 00:06.621
and I was violently craving some strawberry sorbet,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.080
but I was too tired to make it,

00:08.081 --> 00:10.401
so lucky offered to make me some.

00:10.402 --> 00:13.241
He started off by roughly chopping half a lemon

00:13.242 --> 00:15.401
and adding that to a blender.

00:15.402 --> 00:16.761
Once that was in the blender,

00:16.762 --> 00:19.801
he combined that with some sugar as well

00:19.802 --> 00:24.301
and blended that until it was all combined and good to go.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.280
Trust me, you need to leave the lemon peel on the lemon.

00:27.281 --> 00:30.461
It makes such a difference in how the sorbet taste.

00:30.480 --> 00:33.120
Then he moved on to washing some strawberries.

00:33.121 --> 00:35.041
He make sure to wash them really good

00:35.042 --> 00:38.361
because of all the videos he keeps seeing about dirty strawberries.

00:38.362 --> 00:39.841
After they were thoroughly washed,

00:39.842 --> 00:43.141
he cut the tops off and then sliced them in half.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.640
He used about a pound of strawberries.

00:45.641 --> 00:47.361
I don't know whether it's his ADHD,

00:47.362 --> 00:50.361
but watching him cut things and arrange it is

00:50.362 --> 00:51.881
one of the cutest things to me.

00:51.882 --> 00:53.761
Once all of our ingredients were prepped,

00:53.762 --> 00:56.761
he transferred the strawberries over to a blender,

00:56.762 --> 01:00.401
added the lemon and sugar mixture that he pureed earlier,

01:00.402 --> 01:02.581
and a squeeze of half a lemon,

01:02.920 --> 01:06.680
blended that up until there were no chunks visible and it was smooth.

01:06.681 --> 01:08.841
Before pouring it into our ice cream.

01:08.842 --> 01:11.161
Turner let that go on medium speed,

01:11.162 --> 01:13.281
and once it got a little bit more solid,

01:13.282 --> 01:16.421
he turned the speed down to a slower speed.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.320
Let that turn for about 20 minutes

01:18.321 --> 01:20.561
until it reach the consistency he wanted

01:20.562 --> 01:23.361
before spooning some into a bowl for me.

01:23.362 --> 01:24.401
The rest of the ice cream,

01:24.402 --> 01:26.601
he just transfer that over to the freezer.

01:26.602 --> 01:27.241
At this point,

01:27.242 --> 01:28.521
I needed my sorbet,

01:28.522 --> 01:29.881
so I came to try it,

01:29.882 --> 01:32.421
and it was exactly what I was craving.
