00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.040
do you wanna know how absolutely fucking insane mom brain is

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:07.200
I just forgot how old I was when I was talking to somebody

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:08.680
and I told them the wrong age

00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:10.180
confidently I might add

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.360
a lady asked me for an interview and she asked me how old I was

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:15.540
and I was like I'm 38

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.000
fine fine and dandy right

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.440
she calls back to confirm some details

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.160
cause I just wanna double check that you're 38

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:23.640
because I just I found some like

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:25.200
like a conflicting age I guess

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:27.920
and something else that was posted about me or whatever

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:28.520
I'm like no no no

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:31.020
I just turned 38 I'm 37

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.320
and I don't even confidently believe this myself um

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:37.380
because I had to Google it

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.900
hey Google

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.920
if I was born on this day and this year

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:42.860
how old am I

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.240
she was like bitch

00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:45.340
you're 37

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.180
you're 37

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.380
you're 30 fucking seven

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.880
it doesn't really matter anymore

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:53.182
but like um for publication sake
