00:00.000 --> 00:02.520
Have you ever had one of those pinch me moments

00:02.521 --> 00:04.941
where you can't believe that this is your life?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.840
Today was one of those days for me

00:06.841 --> 00:09.761
since I got invited to my first Bottega show.

00:09.762 --> 00:11.681
The ones that have stuck around for a while

00:11.682 --> 00:13.321
know how much I love the brand,

00:13.322 --> 00:16.321
so it's truly an honor that I got invited today.

00:16.322 --> 00:18.521
Even though I had two hours to get ready,

00:18.522 --> 00:19.921
I was still running late,

00:19.922 --> 00:23.061
so I hopped in the car and headed over to the venue.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.200
Once I got there,

00:24.201 --> 00:27.361
we took all the pictures and did the press moments before

00:27.362 --> 00:31.481
I headed inside and saw all these comfy seats for the first time.

00:31.482 --> 00:34.001
Once everyone was seated, the show started.

00:34.002 --> 00:36.541
It was so classic but playful.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.800
I loved all the different layers and the oversized coats,

00:39.801 --> 00:40.641
the silhouettes.

00:40.642 --> 00:44.881
But what I still think about is this white dress that was so stunning.

00:44.882 --> 00:47.481
I caught up with some familiar faces after,

00:47.482 --> 00:50.961
did some more press I couldn't do before the show,

00:50.962 --> 00:54.281
and then we headed to the after party that was right next door.

00:54.282 --> 00:54.841
Was lovely

00:54.842 --> 00:58.201
chatting to Matthew about his collection and thought process

00:58.202 --> 01:01.221
and all the work that went into his beautiful designs.
