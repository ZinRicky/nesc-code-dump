My daughter doesn't like cake,

00:01.601 --> 00:03.441
but it is her birthday in the morning

00:03.442 --> 00:05.881
so she requested a blueberry cake

00:05.882 --> 00:07.681
and even though I'm not a good baker,

00:07.682 --> 00:09.481
I'm trying to make this work.

00:09.482 --> 00:10.921
So when everyone went to bed,

00:10.922 --> 00:15.661
I started baking. Started by making a blueberry compote and a blueberry

00:15.840 --> 00:19.720
and then moved on to mixing all of my dry ingredients

00:19.721 --> 00:22.121
and wet ingredients for my cake.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.401
I combined some eggs with buttermilk,

00:24.402 --> 00:26.321
some vanilla, avocado oil,

00:26.322 --> 00:29.961
and some blueberry puree before whisking that all together.

00:29.962 --> 00:32.321
Then poured my wet into my dry

00:32.322 --> 00:36.321
and mixed it all until combined for adding some blueberry compote

00:36.322 --> 00:40.361
and melted butter, mixing until my batter was nice and shiny.

00:40.362 --> 00:41.921
While my oven was preheating,

00:41.922 --> 00:46.041
I spoon it onto baking sheet and baked it for about 20 minutes.

00:46.042 --> 00:49.481
Once it was done baking, I popped in the freezer for about an hour

00:49.482 --> 00:51.701
before starting on my buttercream.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.840
I whisked together some butter and cream cheese

00:54.841 --> 00:58.761
before slowly adding some powdered sugar and blueberry compote.

00:58.762 --> 01:00.441
After about an hour in the freezer,

01:00.442 --> 01:02.321
I cut out some round circles.

01:02.322 --> 01:04.721
Since I was making a four layer cake,

01:04.722 --> 01:06.561
I spread some buttercream on it,

01:06.562 --> 01:08.441
followed by blueberry compote,

01:08.442 --> 01:10.401
and then I added on my next layer

01:10.402 --> 01:12.801
and repeated that for all four layers.

01:12.802 --> 01:16.641
Once I reached the top, I spread my blueberry buttercream all over

01:16.642 --> 01:19.141
and tried to get it as neat as possible.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.980
For taking some fresh blueberries and creating little clusters.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.820
Since she is turning 4. I opted for four blueberries and four
