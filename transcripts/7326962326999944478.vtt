00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.600
yes absolutely

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.721
this narrative that having an abortion is the worst

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:08.801
most traumatic day of a woman's life is not at all backed by research

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:10.081
and it's a really harmful narrative

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:11.941
because the anti choice movement

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.640
uses it to fuel a stereotype that women regret their abortions

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:21.041
and therefore we should not allow women the choice to get one

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:23.401
which in the turnaway study

00:00:23.402 --> 00:00:24.841
which is the largest study done

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:27.761
comparing women who were denied wanted abortions

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:30.241
versus women who received a wanted abortion

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:31.561
they talk about this

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.761
it's called the dignity of risk

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:34.441
that basically

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:37.881
women should have the right to make their own personal decisions

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:40.621
even decisions they might regret

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.760
however the research shows that regret is not the most common

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:48.381
or even close to the most common response to having an abortion

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.240
overwhelmingly

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:53.961
the most common emotion felt after having an abortion was relief

00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:57.521
at 90% those who were denied an abortion

00:00:57.522 --> 00:00:59.881
the most common emotions were sadness

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:01.521
followed by regret

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:05.181
the most common emotional response to having an abortion is actually none

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.400
over time two thirds of women say that they experience no

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.241
or very few emotions about the abortion anymore

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:13.541
they also talk about how this is because

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.000
women have a lot more going on in their lives than their abortion um

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:24.001
95% of women reported that having the abortion was the right decision for them

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.561
and if you're wondering about that remaining 5%

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:29.921
the 5% reported high community stigma

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:31.121
that their groups

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:35.841
their social groups shamed them and made them feel very bad about their abortion

00:01:35.842 --> 00:01:38.481
and it LED them feeling like their decision to have an abortion

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:39.401
was very difficult

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:41.101
and that they somewhat regretted it

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.320
the women who had the hardest time emotionally

00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:45.841
were those who placed the child for adoption

00:01:45.842 --> 00:01:49.041
so this idea that we should just force women to have birth

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.981
because they can just give the child up for adoption

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.780
adoption is not a band aid for forced birth
