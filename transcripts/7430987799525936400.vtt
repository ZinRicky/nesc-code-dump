00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.440
I think we've finally done it

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:03.360
we've finally bitten off more than we can chew

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:05.840
so welcome to side quest No. 798

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:08.080
where we attempt to renovate a 50 year old pool

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:10.400
with no pool renovation experience

00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:12.437
and instead, should I be focusing on my 

00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:13.660
creepy laundry makeover?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.106
probably but am I also very easily distracted 

00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:17.320
by shining new side quests

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:18.760
you already know the answer to that

00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:20.416
and as you can see this pool

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:22.132
 for lack of a better phrase 

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:22.724
is fkd 

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:23.080
Itâ€™s filthy

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:24.960
for starters we've got tiles coming off

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:27.154
paint coming off holes in the plaster and 

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:28.200
an algae infestation

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:30.320
but like everything else that we found in this house

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.800
she's got fantastic bones

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:33.360
she just needs a little.. shaping ðŸ’… 

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.500
and this is a sentence I don't say often

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.289
it's enormous 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.520
it's about 10 metres long

00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:40.160
five metres across and well over two metres in the deep end

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:42.440
and she's made of concrete so she's a sturdy girl

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.800
We had a great summer here last year

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.160
but we decided that by the time summer rolled around again

00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:47.880
we were gonna have done some work on the pool

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.880
and summer's coming so we better get to

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:50.920
first step was to drain it

00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:53.520
and Goldie was deeply curious about the circles on the bottom

00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:55.440
which are left over from previous repairs

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:56.600
and I just wanna let you know that

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:58.800
we haven't gone into this project completely blind

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.160
We had multiple pool people come over and give us their thoughts

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.663
we've had experts come and check

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:04.120
 out all of our pipes and pumps

00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:05.400
and make sure that they're all good

00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:06.920
And prior to starting the aesthetic work

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.920
we did have one pump in the spa replaced

00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:10.120
but that was only because

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:11.815
one of the kids thought it would be a good 

00:01:11.816 --> 00:01:12.880
idea to post a sinkie into

00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:14.687
so the boys and by boys I mean 

00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:16.320
my husband and my eldest son

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:19.480
made a start by chipping off all of the existing waterline tiles

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:21.800
and these are obviously a gorgeous vintage tile

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.815
we did actually go down the route of exploring 

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:25.360
whether or not we could salvage them

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:27.680
and we hunted and hunted but we couldn't find a match

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:30.960
and the reality is they're really just hanging on by a thread at this point

00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:32.120
so they did need to go

00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:33.911
and I have got an idea in mind about how I 

00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:35.120
might be able to upcycle them

00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:37.800
so that they can continue to live on here at the pool

00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:39.400
but I'll have to keep you posted on that

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:44.160
so anyway you've just seen Mark remove about 16,133 tiles

00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:45.960
which I find oddly satisfying

00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:47.640
and I don't know what it is about this man

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:48.536
he loves to vacuum

00:01:48.537 --> 00:01:49.880
 but only on a job site

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:51.640
I don't know if anyone wants to know the history

00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:53.360
but I personally find it fascinating

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:56.840
this pool was put in about 20 years after the original home was built

00:01:56.841 --> 00:01:59.120
I think around a similar time that they built the extension

00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:00.320
and if I have my facts straight

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:03.160
at the same time there were also horses roaming around this property

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:04.760
it was definitely a homestead at one point

00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:06.000
but it has been subdivided

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.240
if I understand correctly

00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:08.520
the mum was an avid swimmer

00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:09.735
maybe even competitive?

00:02:09.736 --> 00:02:11.480
 which explains this massive pool

00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:12.960
by the way I'm posting in real time

00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:14.200
and there is still so much to do

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:15.806
so you have to come back I'm sorry!!
