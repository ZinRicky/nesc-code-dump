00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.740
I'm sorry, Lisa.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.080
I am pumped about protecting abortion.

00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:07.121
It's the economy I really care about.

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:09.861
And Trump, he's keeping this economy yoked.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.480
But you do realize that abortion is an economic issue.

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:14.881
I thought abortion was just about, like,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.601
morals and feelings and stuff.

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.401
Well, when women are denied access to abortion,

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:19.601
that affects their ability to work,

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.201
to finish school, to earn money.

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:23.761
And banning abortion slows down the economy.

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:27.021
I want the house of Congress to be a house of gains.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.360
When women have access to abortion,

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:30.561
they can decide to have kids,

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:33.841
which means that they are more likely to finish their education

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:36.081
and get better jobs. That means that they make more money,

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:38.181
which boost the economy. OK,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.160
no offense, Lindsay,

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:43.741
but I'm no soy boy. This is just about women,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.160
not about me. Being forced into parenthood early hurts men's wallets,

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:50.681
too. Studies estimate that abortion restrictions cost the US economy

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:54.541
$173 billion a year. Wait,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.400
billion?

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.140
Like with a B? It's all connected, Kevin.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.960
Economic mobility is like a protein shake.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.641
If you don't get the nutrients that you need,

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:07.021
you can stay strong. And with strict abortion bans,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.680
neither can the economy. So abortion access isn't the way

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.661
protein of the economy,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.069
sure.
