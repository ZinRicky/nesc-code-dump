00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.440
Let me show you how I taught syllabication with magnetiles.

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:03.761
If you don't know what syllabication is,

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:05.481
is how you break down words into their syllables.

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:06.801
And the number of syllables is determined

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:08.041
by how many vowels there are in a word.

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:09.881
The exceptions being vowel teams in silent e.

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:12.001
But for this activity, we're focusing on open and close syllables,

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:13.521
and how to determine where we're gonna split them.

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:15.281
So on my large square magnet tile,

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:16.681
you could also use four small square tiles.

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:17.761
I wrote a two syllable word,

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:18.761
breaking in two different ways.

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:20.201
One way with an open syllable first,

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:21.721
and the second being with a closed syllable. First,

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.881
my daughter read them both ways and decide which one was correct,

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:25.761
covered up the one that was wrong with triangle tiles.

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:27.441
Doing this activity with familiar words

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:28.881
helps them to hear the difference.

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:30.761
And it's such an important skill to practice,

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:32.721
so they can decode longer and harder words later.

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:33.761
And when they know the rules,

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:35.501
they can become confident readers.
