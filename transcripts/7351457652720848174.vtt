00:00.800 --> 00:05.460
I'm going to take you along my morning workout routine.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.360
Typically, I do the hour before the kids wake up,

00:08.361 --> 00:10.201
and then Daniel takes the next hour.

00:10.202 --> 00:13.501
We kind of tag team on working out in the mornings.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.580
I woke up to a hefty amount of snow again.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.480
It froze last night,

00:18.481 --> 00:20.121
a pretty hard freeze,

00:20.122 --> 00:23.561
so the windshield was solid ice.

00:23.562 --> 00:26.981
It took me a good 10 minutes and to scrape all the ice off.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.400
Then we got going.

00:28.401 --> 00:30.881
The meadow was beautiful this morning.

00:30.882 --> 00:33.721
It was overcasty and really cloudy,

00:33.722 --> 00:35.101
and everything was white.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.240
It was really beautiful.

00:36.241 --> 00:40.561
I love driving by the dairy because, guys,

00:40.562 --> 00:42.681
we are so close to finishing this project.

00:42.682 --> 00:45.801
We should be getting our milk cows early spring,

00:45.802 --> 00:47.301
which is really exciting.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.180
Our winters are really long up here in the valley,

00:50.920 --> 00:53.180
but they're beautiful.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.420
Very long. I got to the gym,

00:55.600 --> 00:59.040
and I am really bad at filming while I work out,

00:59.041 --> 01:00.901
so this was my last exercise.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.620
Today was shoulders.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.080
So after an hour of shoulder exercises,

01:05.081 --> 01:06.901
my shoulders were completely shot.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.960
Like, in a good way.

01:08.961 --> 01:10.821
I'm gonna be really sore from today.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.000
On the way home,

01:13.001 --> 01:15.701
the sun was starting to peak through the clouds,

01:15.920 --> 01:18.660
but it was still really foggy and Misty.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.180
It almost felt like you were actually in the clouds.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.780
It's so beautiful.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.120
But it's gonna be warm today and sunny,

01:27.121 --> 01:29.681
so I'm sure most of the snow will melt today.

01:29.682 --> 01:32.481
We're kind of on the Snow during the night,

01:32.482 --> 01:33.561
but during the day,

01:33.562 --> 01:34.941
most of it melt off.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.320
Haas is, of course,

01:39.321 --> 01:40.401
always on the lookout.

01:40.402 --> 01:43.601
Haases are our Great Pyrenees guardian dog.

01:43.602 --> 01:47.941
He's huge. He's already starting to lose some of his winter coat.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.860
He's very, very fluffy in the wintertime.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.940
And that was my morning gym routine.
