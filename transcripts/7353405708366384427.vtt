00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Have you ever met a guy while dating,

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:03.601
he's genuine, funny,

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:06.121
smart, the most charismatic

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:08.201
nice guy that you've ever met

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:12.801
and then he opens up about his horror stories of his ex

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:14.801
and you're like you?

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:16.218
there's no way that happened to you.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.321
you're like the most genuine

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:19.921
nice person, how does that even happen?

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:21.361
Which got me thinking,

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:24.041
Some women are ruining it for us,

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:26.861
making men think that all women are horrible.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.560
So I think that we all need to step it up as woman,

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:33.479
put some respect on women's names.
