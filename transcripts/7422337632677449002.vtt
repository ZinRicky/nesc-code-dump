If your man or woman does not share locations with you,

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.241
then you should be worried.

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:06.201
Okay? Cause I cannot think of a single reason

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:09.541
why I would not share my location with my partner

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.160
or anyone that I care about.

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:12.321
All of my friends, family,

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:13.601
they all have my location.

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:15.921
And it's usually for safety reasons. Honestly.

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:16.961
Sometimes it's for snooping.

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:18.921
I'm sure it's fine. We all do it. Okay?

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:20.401
Never. Because we don't trust each other.

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:23.461
If your partner refuses to share locations with you.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.440
Kind of sus a little sketch.

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.721
What are they doing? Know so many people are torn on this,

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:29.361
but I will die on this hill

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.981
if they refuse to share locations with you after you've asked.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.249
Little suspicious.
