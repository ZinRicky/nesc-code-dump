00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.860
So my last video on MLM's multi level marketing

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.600
did ruffles and feathers,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.400
and honestly,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.160
it was a joke.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.120
But now, um, ha ha ha.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.960
I'm gonna show you

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.240
financial disclosure list of how much, um,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.540
the average person makes with MLM companies.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.880
Okay, so let's start with Monet. Okay,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.120
so these are the different tears that you have here.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.320
Okay, this tear right here,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.720
that's 92% of people who sell Monet.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.200
Let's take a gamble on how much they make.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.800
Do you have your guess?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.640
Okay, on average,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.840
they make $133 a year.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.920
Okay, now let's look at young living.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.160
Okay, this is 64.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
64% of their partners.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.460
What do we think they made

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.380
the highest?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.360
Almost $600.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.500
The average is $22, guys.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.320
The average is $22.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.020
And now let's look at Amir. Amir,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.080
I don't know how you say this one,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.440
to be honest,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.520
but it's the people that sell, like,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.560
the happy juice stuff

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.520
who are promising you that you're gonna have great gut

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.080
health food,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.180
drink this juice.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.520
Um, Brand Partners.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.040
Let's see what percentage, uh,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.080
it is 86% of the people who sell it.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.740
And now let's see if you got your guess.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.620
$25 a month.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.780
See average compensation that.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.640
Only picking these companies

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.040
because they're probably the most popular ones

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.600
that I see a lot.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.880
But just so you know,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.560
MLMs who promised you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.160
that you're gonna make thousands of dollars.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.400
Unless you were in like

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.160
the top percentage,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.120
you're not person who's promising You

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.320
that you can make a lovable income at home

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.380
on your phone?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.000
No. Based on these stats, no.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.120
Can you? Sure. Maybe.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.640
I don't know

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.480
cause I've never done it.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.840
But I would like to see actual income stats

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.000
from people who say this.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.700
Some line is that

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.440
MLMs are not a get rich quick situation.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.560
You're not gonna make

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.520
the average person.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.960
I'll just say

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.120
the average person is not gonna make, um,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.520
thousands of dollars doing it.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.200
So just have some discernment.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.440
Probably going to be the last time

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.560
I'm talking about Emma Lunch

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.560
because for some reason

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.560
they're so controversial.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.880
But just thought I'd put this out there

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.500
if you want the general info.
