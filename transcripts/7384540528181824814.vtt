00:00.040 --> 00:02.720
We've been spending a lot of time outside by the pool,

00:02.721 --> 00:05.121
and I realized that we ran out of sunscreen,

00:05.122 --> 00:06.921
but asked lucky to make me some.

00:06.922 --> 00:08.281
We all burn pretty easily,

00:08.282 --> 00:11.221
so we went with something with a little bit more SPF.

00:11.360 --> 00:14.800
He started by adding some coconut into his bowl.

00:14.801 --> 00:17.841
He's a baker, so he makes sure that everything is very precise

00:17.842 --> 00:20.761
before moving on to adding some beeswax,

00:20.762 --> 00:23.361
shea butter, and also some cocoa butter.

00:23.362 --> 00:25.481
Once all of that was combined in the bowl,

00:25.482 --> 00:27.961
he added some jojoba oil as well.

00:27.962 --> 00:31.401
He then filled a pot with some water before placing it on the stove,

00:31.402 --> 00:32.641
letting it come to a boil,

00:32.642 --> 00:35.041
and placing the glass bowl on top of that,

00:35.042 --> 00:39.021
he continuously stirred until everything was melted and combined.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.280
Once it was taken off the heat,

00:40.281 --> 00:43.161
he added some zinc oxide powder to that

00:43.162 --> 00:45.921
before whisking that all together for about a minute,

00:45.922 --> 00:48.501
just making sure that's all coming together.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.000
Once everything was combined,

00:50.001 --> 00:52.201
he transferred it over to a glass jar

00:52.202 --> 00:56.201
before closing that and popping that in the fridge to solidify.

00:56.202 --> 01:00.161
About an hour later, it was all solid and ready to apply.

01:00.162 --> 01:02.858
This went on so smooth and didn't leave a white cast on.
