00:00.120 --> 00:00.720
Earlier today,

00:00.720 --> 00:02.120
I wrote my husband a note

00:02.120 --> 00:04.360
asking him to surprise me with dinner reservations,

00:04.360 --> 00:05.640
and he did! He asked a

00:05.640 --> 00:08.080
few New York locals what their favorite spots were

00:08.080 --> 00:09.300
and then picked one,

00:09.360 --> 00:10.320
made a reservation,

00:10.320 --> 00:12.480
and here we are at the Monkey Bar.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.760
I loved how cozy the atmosphere was.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.040
If there's mocktails on the menu,

00:16.040 --> 00:17.040
we get the mocktails.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.400
I didn't like the one I ordered,

00:18.400 --> 00:19.760
so lucky traded me

00:19.760 --> 00:21.360
even though he didn't like mine either,

00:21.360 --> 00:22.780
but his was really good.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.100
We got some artichoke dip and vodka pasta for starters.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.320
Vodka pasta was very mediocre.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.560
Make better vodka pasta

00:30.560 --> 00:32.020
so I wasn't impressed.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.440
But lucky ended up finishing off the pasta and the dip

00:35.440 --> 00:38.760
because I limited myself to only eating a little bit

00:38.760 --> 00:40.760
cause I knew I wouldn't be able to have my main

00:40.760 --> 00:41.980
if I had more.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.440
We both got steaks

00:43.440 --> 00:46.040
and then I got some creamy mushrooms and buttery

00:46.040 --> 00:47.520
garlic mashed potatoes with it

00:47.520 --> 00:49.860
while he got some French fries with his.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.400
My favorite thing were the mushrooms.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.280
They were so good

00:52.280 --> 00:53.760
with the steak key.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.640
Having steak with ketchup felt criminal,

00:55.640 --> 00:57.620
but it was a lot better than it looked.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.600
I was in a food coma at this point

00:59.600 --> 01:01.400
and I couldn't finish my food,

01:01.400 --> 01:02.640
so lucky had the rest.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.000
I still needed something sweet

01:04.000 --> 01:06.700
so we got some ice cream and headed back to the hotel.
