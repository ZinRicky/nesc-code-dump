00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.040
Come shopping with me for spooky stuff at Marshall's Home Goods!

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.641
I never get to do things like this

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:06.241
because I usually have a toddler with me

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:08.681
and I love Halloween. The first thing I spotted though,

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:11.821
was this discarded sweater that I'm definitely gonna pick up.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.720
It was meant to be.

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.601
Now my daughter is having a Wednesday Addams themed 10th birthday

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:18.321
and I wanted to get some of these really cute sparkly pillows.

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:21.621
How cute would those be for her little glamping sleepover tents?

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.200
They were kind of on the pricey side,

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:26.281
so I only got a couple. They were each 2999.

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:29.721
They also had all of their pumpkins out of every type of decoration,

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:31.401
but I was really drawn to Medusa.

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:33.161
But I definitely brought home Medusa.

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:35.841
Next I found some really cute clothes that I wanted to try on

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:37.521
because again, I never get to try on clothes.

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:40.401
I always online shop. I loved these two pieces.

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:41.681
They were both statement pieces,

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:44.401
but together with a pair of sneakers they're absolutely wearable.

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:46.041
I loved the netting on the top.

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:47.281
It's from house of Harlow.

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:49.081
It definitely reminded me of the sixties.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.081
And speaking of the 60s, here was another house of Harlow dress.

00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:53.881
This one was not quite perfect.

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:55.201
The fit just wasn't there.

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:57.521
I was heading to Utah, so I really wanted a denim dress,

00:00:57.522 --> 00:00:59.961
but this one just did not have the right cut.

00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:02.141
But the metallic skirt and top definitely made it.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.000
Then I scooted over to the bag aisle

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.321
because look at these adorable themed bags for Halloween.

00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:10.281
I can't describe it, but something like this just gives me so much joy.

00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:12.041
And I saw somebody wearing this out.

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:13.441
I would just die.

00:01:13.442 --> 00:01:15.761
They also had some loungeflies and some Harry Potter stuff,

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:16.961
which I was really surprised by

00:01:16.962 --> 00:01:19.161
because I don't usually shop at Marshalls. Again,

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.761
I don't get to shop in person a lot.

00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:22.961
I almost got this loungefly cause it was only $40,

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:25.041
which is. But then I saw these real leather bags.

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:27.241
They smelled incredible. And if you know about real leather,

00:01:27.242 --> 00:01:28.961
you know that you can smell the difference.

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:31.161
I was shocked by the price point and the quality.

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:32.961
But if you wanna know what actually made it home with me,

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:34.641
I was looking for a side table for my office,

00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:36.861
and this macaroon table definitely came home.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.607
Such a random basket, but such a fun trip to Marshalls.
