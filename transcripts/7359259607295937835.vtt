00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.800
y'all will post things like this

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:06.361
and genuinely not see a single issue with this fact

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:10.441
you can buy 3 shirts 3 shirt for less than a price of a burger

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:13.841
does that not ring like a single alarm bell in your brain

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:17.281
are there like any thoughts further than oh I can get more

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:18.201
I can consume more

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:24.561
you have no thoughts that are like oh I wonder how can this shirt be that cheap

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:28.301
what's going on behind the scenes that will make these three shirts

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.760
cheaper than a burger

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.841
I'm not even one of those people that demonizes fast fashion

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:33.561
because I think it's a very complex issue

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:36.121
and I do know that at least for plus size people

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:37.961
fast fashion is often the only option that we have

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:40.441
but like we need to work on a relationship to clothing

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:42.681
cause the way that fast fashion has genuinely changed

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:44.081
the way that we think about clothes

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:44.921
the average consumer

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:48.881
fast fashion does not comprehend how much clothing is actually worth

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.026
because every time you buy these items of clothing 

00:00:52.027 --> 00:00:53.321
for like less than $5

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:56.301
it almost always means that somewhere along line

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.320
there are people being exploited to make that garment for you

00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:00.441
I know this will get people to change their opinion overnight

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:03.921
but like think about your relationship to consumption into clothing

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:07.391
and understand the consequences of you being able to buy a three dollar shirt
