Okay, you guys know that I moved,

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:04.921
and the only thing I don't love is my kitchen is super teeny tiny.

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:09.641
But look at this little space saver fruit basket.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:12.761
It just has these little hooks that go under your cabinet.

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.841
I literally put them in with my own hand,

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:18.481
and then you can keep your fruits and veggies off the counter

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:20.321
and save space. I absolutely love it.

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:22.781
It's linked here in the TikTok shop if you want one.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.785
It's really necessary for this teeny tiny kitchen that I have.
