Dylan Movaney has no idea what girlhood is.

00:02.320 --> 00:04.800
Girlhood is spending the entire summer you turn 13

00:04.800 --> 00:07.640
crying and trying to figure out why you feel like a little girl

00:07.640 --> 00:09.400
and a grown woman at the same time.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.440
It's always having a sweater on hand in high school,

00:11.440 --> 00:13.320
just in case you need it to tie around your waist

00:13.320 --> 00:15.240
so nobody will see blood on your pants.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.600
Finding yourself as a teenager

00:16.600 --> 00:19.760
feeling both awkwardly sexualized and not sexy enough

00:19.760 --> 00:21.040
somehow at the same time.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.800
It's spending hours on your knees

00:22.800 --> 00:25.120
praying that your body will be able to get pregnant,

00:25.120 --> 00:26.880
and then falling back down on your knees

00:26.880 --> 00:28.860
feeling devastated and like a failure.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.920
Your body loses a baby you desperately wanted.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.520
It's worrying about endometriosis,

00:32.520 --> 00:33.480
ovarian cancer,

00:33.480 --> 00:34.600
yearly mammograms,

00:34.600 --> 00:36.920
pelvic exams, ectopic pregnancies,

00:36.920 --> 00:38.720
birth control, and postpartum depression.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.360
It's being afraid to walk alone at night.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.560
It's dedicating your body to the growth,

00:42.560 --> 00:45.320
development, and nutrition of a new human being

00:45.320 --> 00:47.860
that is completely dependent and reliant on you.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.920
And using your body to play a major role

00:49.920 --> 00:51.680
in keeping the human population alive.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.560
And still feeling like it isn't good enough,

00:53.560 --> 00:54.480
it isn't skinny enough,

00:54.480 --> 00:55.880
it isn't perfect enough.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.080
It's watching your little babies grow

00:57.080 --> 00:59.080
from fetuses to infants to toddlers

00:59.080 --> 01:01.520
to children to teenagers and into adulthood.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.040
Feeling your heart swell with joy at watching them grow

01:04.040 --> 01:06.900
and heartbreak at the same time because it means they need you less.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.320
It's going through the long and Slow process of menopause

01:09.320 --> 01:12.440
and watching as your body and your mind drastically change

01:12.440 --> 01:13.440
all back over again,

01:13.440 --> 01:15.400
almost the way they did when you were 13.

01:15.400 --> 01:15.920
And, of course,

01:15.920 --> 01:18.280
it's being expected to sit back and quietly watch

01:18.280 --> 01:20.120
as males dress up like you,

01:20.120 --> 01:21.080
as they mimic you,

01:21.080 --> 01:22.340
as they mock you,

01:22.400 --> 01:25.080
and as they get brand deals and millions of dollars for doing so.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.040
It's wonderful.

01:26.040 --> 01:26.840
It's difficult,

01:26.840 --> 01:27.720
it's heartbreaking,

01:27.720 --> 01:28.480
it's exciting,

01:28.480 --> 01:30.560
it's fun. And it's very deep.

01:30.560 --> 01:31.520
So deep, in fact,

01:31.520 --> 01:33.600
that it is intertwined in your very DNA.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.400
And it is something that can never,

01:35.400 --> 01:38.666
ever be purchased nor surgically manufactured.
