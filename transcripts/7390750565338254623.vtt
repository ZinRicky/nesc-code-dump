00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
Men and women are not the same.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.420
And that is a blessing. He provides and protects,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.060
I multiply. He is the head of the family,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.460
I am the heart. He provides the shelter,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.300
I give it a heartbeat. He provides the ingredients,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.060
I make the meal. He provides the house,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.220
I make it into a home. He takes care of my outer world,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.380
I take care of his inner world.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.740
He gave me love, I gave him life.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.180
Our roles compliment rather than compete.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.580
Where god created two from one,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.340
two became one in marriage.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.700
Equal value, equal honour.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.700
Equally needed for the family.
