00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.153
I woke up this morning 

00:00:01.154 --> 00:00:02.413
trying not to panic because

00:00:02.414 --> 00:00:03.160
 I've bitten off

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:04.800
a hell of a lot to do but if I panic

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:05.480
I won't get done

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:07.468
so I just need to get through this day and 

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:09.040
every other day one step at a time

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.800
the good news is that the days are flying by

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:11.610
and the bad news 

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.040
is that the days are flying by

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.880
and there's just not enough hours within them

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.640
I started my day the way that I always do

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:18.338
by raiding my anti anxiety station 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:19.600
and doing some breath work

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:21.296
because I think that that's the only thing 

00:00:21.297 --> 00:00:22.520
that's keeping me slightly sane

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.520
made a coffee checked on the pool progress

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:25.440
snuggled my babies

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:28.200
and then it was time to get busy with my first chore of the day

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:30.103
and genuine question but how we keeping 

00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:31.960
lunch boxes fun and exciting year round?

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:33.800
I try to vary what I give them day to day

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.622
but I think I need some fresh inspiration 

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:38.160
today we had ciabatta and plain white bread for my daughter

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:40.960
beetroot hummus lettuce from the garden and some roast chicken

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:43.360
and don't get me wrong I would love to get some more veggies in there

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:44.840
but this is all that they wanted

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:46.480
I gave them a side of fruit salad each

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:48.551
and then for the snacks I kinda got lazy and 

00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:49.840
gave them a side of pretzels

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.520
mini Oreos and a gummy watch

00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:52.960
but I was running out of time at this point

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:54.720
I finished the lunches packed the bags

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.720
raced through the bathroom

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:56.584
did some skincare 

00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:57.880
forgot to turn my camera on

00:00:57.881 --> 00:00:58.633
love that for me 

00:00:58.634 --> 00:00:59.920
and then into the car we went

00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:01.320
once all the babies were dropped off

00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:02.320
I raced through the shops

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.118
because I needed to get some tomato plants 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.080
to donate to the school

00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:06.669
and then because I think the theme of 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.840
the day today must be racing

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.400
and forgetting to turn my camera on

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:11.720
I raced through the chores and only captured part of them

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:13.080
I did a bit of email admin

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.560
and then it was time to make some breakfast for my tradie

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:17.120
I toasted up a couple bagels

00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:19.040
top that with avocado lettuce

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:20.760
bacon and some cheesy eggs

00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:22.940
can't forget pepper and a dollop of hollandaise

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.080
then I took that outside

00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:25.783
to where Mark had been working tirelessly 

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:27.000
since first thing this morning

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.120
because we're not only racing the clock with this pool

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:30.440
but we're racing the weather as well

00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:32.400
but you just can't leave an old pool empty for long

00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:34.360
cause it can cause some really major issues

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:35.720
so as soon as we get a fine day

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.720
it's all hands on deck and by all hands

00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:39.393
I mean just Mark and Iâ€™s because 

00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:40.560
nobody wants to help us

00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:41.600
I picked the kids up from school

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.040
made everyone some afternoon tea

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.680
and my husband got a beer as part of his afternoon tea

00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:47.920
and then it was time for olive and I to head out again

00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:49.480
because she's got a piano lesson

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:51.160
and while I was waiting for her to have her lesson

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:53.360
I went to the florist and then the supermarket

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:55.120
you know really fkn riveting stuff

00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:57.160
and then I got home and straight into cooking dinner

00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:59.760
I've been really loving these Cassia at home curry sauces

00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:01.080
they taste very authentic

00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:02.720
and it made dinner so quick and easy

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.040
I sauteed up some chicken

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:05.080
onion capsicum

00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:07.000
and then added the curry sauce

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:08.807
meanwhile I had my rice cooking before 

00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:09.920
frying up some poppadoms

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.880
it was quick and hearty and comforting

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.280
which was exactly what I needed after a long day

00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:16.720
but can someone please tell me how we're plating up rice these days?

00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:18.760
cause I still do it like it's 1989

00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:20.331
then I hit the wall, had a shower 

00:02:20.332 --> 00:02:21.394
and was asleep by 8:30 

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:21.950
it was bliss
