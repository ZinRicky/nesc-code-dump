00:01.040 --> 00:03.500
I'm slowly getting kicked out of the kitchen.

00:03.520 --> 00:06.300
The kids are cooking more and more lately.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.400
Today they wanted to make pizza.

00:08.401 --> 00:10.961
So they first started by making mozzarella.

00:10.962 --> 00:13.001
They got two gallons of raw milk.

00:13.002 --> 00:13.961
They left the cream on,

00:13.962 --> 00:16.101
so this was a whole milk mozzarella.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.640
They added their citric acid and animal in it.

00:19.641 --> 00:21.301
Then they cut the curds,

00:21.520 --> 00:23.800
and they strain them from the way.

00:23.801 --> 00:25.721
And then they put the way back on the stove,

00:25.722 --> 00:26.401
heated that up,

00:26.402 --> 00:28.501
and they started to stretch the mozzarella.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.360
It turned out to be a beautiful batch of cheese.

00:31.361 --> 00:33.821
It was so smooth and so creamy.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.720
They did do quite the number on the stove,

00:36.721 --> 00:38.241
but it was really good.

00:38.242 --> 00:40.041
And they got to work on their fire.

00:40.042 --> 00:42.781
The boys are very talented firemakers,

00:43.840 --> 00:44.800
way better than I am.

00:44.801 --> 00:46.221
So they made the fire,

00:46.840 --> 00:49.320
and then they started shaping the dough.

00:49.321 --> 00:50.201
So they shape the dough,

00:50.202 --> 00:51.861
got into a pizza shape,

00:52.240 --> 00:54.560
added the, uh,

00:54.561 --> 00:55.281
the red sauce,

00:55.282 --> 00:57.141
and they added their homemade mozzarella,

00:57.400 --> 00:58.580
some nice meat.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.800
Their goal today was trying to figure out how to slide the pizza off

01:02.801 --> 01:04.581
as easily as possible

01:05.200 --> 01:06.300
from the paddle.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.920
Of course, this one didn't work,

01:07.921 --> 01:11.761
so they had to take it back in and add more flour underneath.

01:11.762 --> 01:15.281
But they later Learned that corn mill was the best option,

01:15.282 --> 01:16.221
not flour.

01:16.960 --> 01:17.320
But, yeah,

01:17.321 --> 01:20.701
the pizza turned out so well with the.

01:21.040 --> 01:21.960
The homemade mozzarella.

01:21.961 --> 01:23.321
It was so stretchy.

01:23.322 --> 01:25.521
Today was so delicious.

01:25.522 --> 01:26.581
Everyone loved it.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.120
Then they just made a bunch of different pizzas,

01:29.121 --> 01:34.201
different toppings with basil and tomatoes.

01:34.202 --> 01:38.621
But overall, there's me and flora just watching them do their things.

01:38.800 --> 01:42.860
Overall, the favorite pizza was mozzarella, pepperoni,

01:42.880 --> 01:49.240
jalapenos. And then when the pizza is hot out of the oven,

01:49.241 --> 01:50.721
you drizzle honey on the top.

01:50.722 --> 01:53.581
And this is all the kids favorite pizza at the moment.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.440
Even Mabel and Martha.

01:55.441 --> 01:55.921
Everyone loved.

01:55.922 --> 01:57.041
It's a little bit spicy,

01:57.042 --> 01:59.661
but everyone loves this pizza.
