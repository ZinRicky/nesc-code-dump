00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.280
men rule the world they're in charge of everything

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:05.241
I think we just need a little place to get

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:10.101
do you think that spaces that are designed specifically for women

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.940
are discriminatory

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.160
that's exactly what a Tasmanian court is currently debating

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:21.881
I'm Doctor Zoe and I start my PhD at the school of design

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:25.201
specifically looking at gender and place

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:27.321
so I obviously wanna talk about it

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:29.081
now if you're not familiar with Australia

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:31.441
there's that little triangle at the bottom

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:37.421
which is called Tasmania Tasmania has a pretty famous art gallery called Mona

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.440
and in that art gallery is something called the Ladies Lounge

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.541
it is a lounge where you get served champagne

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.980
and you get to relax on velvet couches

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.240
and it's only for people who identify as women

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:52.921
so one man went to Mona

00:00:52.922 --> 00:00:58.201
and he soon discovered that he would not be allowed access into the ladies lab

00:00:58.202 --> 00:01:00.421
so what did he decide to do

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.780
he decided to take the artist to court for discrimination

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.900
because he feels it's unfair that he doesn't get to experience the artwork

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.720
and he also thinks that men should be able to experience it

00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:17.281
or that women should have to pay more for access to the entire art gallery

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:21.501
because they get access to more spaces than men do in the art gallery

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.860
but that's not actually true

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.080
men do get to experience the artwork just as much as women do

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:31.121
not in the same way but just as much

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:31.801
as women do

00:01:31.802 --> 00:01:37.861
men get to experience what it feels like to feel excluded from certain spaces

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.460
men get to experience what it feels like to pay the same but get less

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.960
men get to experience what it feels like to be jealous

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:50.861
of the level of comfort that another gender get to experience

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.040
men get all of those things as a part of the artwork

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:56.281
and if men were allowed in the ladies lounge

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.961
then it wouldn't be the artwork

00:01:58.962 --> 00:01:59.361
so

00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:03.781
why should women have to pay more for something that men also get to experience

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.780
just because men might not like it as much as women

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.500
is art there to be liked enjoyed

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.920
or is art there to make us ponder

00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:19.821
think question I hope that these are the things that the judge considers

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.700
but the thing that really gets me about this case

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.360
is that it's men who invented gender segregation in the first place

00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:31.821
there is a seat in the city of Melbourne that is for ladies only

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.080
that was designed by men

00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:39.061
there are still clubs that only get to be experienced by men

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.900
even Rotary International

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.080
uh I think until recently all men might still have some male only

00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:47.081
but of course

00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:51.421
we know that women are still excluded from many leadership positions

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.340
but this was formalised until relatively recently

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.500
women were not allowed in certain spaces of leadership or government

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.500
women weren't allowed in pubs

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.180
women weren't allowed bank accounts

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.960
and even though we're now allowed in these spaces

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:14.681
have you ever walked into a pub and just felt completely like it's not for you

00:03:14.682 --> 00:03:19.741
like you feel unsafe you feel overly perceived

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.400
you don't feel comfortable because there's this underlying um

00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:29.181
energy that it's not for you

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.080
I really hope that the court finds

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:34.281
that the Ladies Lounge can continue to operate

00:03:34.282 --> 00:03:34.681
because

00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:39.741
I think that it will set a really interesting precedent in the court system

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.640
one that doesn't already exist

00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:43.561
which is why this is such an interesting case

00:03:43.562 --> 00:03:50.161
it will set a really interesting precedent for the way that space and gender

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:52.341
and discrimination intersect

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.680
and I believe it will set a precedent that

00:03:54.681 --> 00:04:02.821
basically says that these types of spaces can exist under certain circumstances

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.620
IE for equity reasons rather than for discriminatory reasons

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.960
either way I think it's really excellent

00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:17.041
that the artist is choosing to use this moment as an extension of the artwork

00:04:17.042 --> 00:04:19.521
itself it's basically performance art

00:04:19.522 --> 00:04:21.681
every interview she is giving

00:04:21.682 --> 00:04:22.841
every um

00:04:22.842 --> 00:04:24.201
court appearance she has

00:04:24.202 --> 00:04:28.461
she's using it as an extension of the artwork to make the point

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.780
prove that point continue that point

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.686
double down and I love it so much
