00:00.680 --> 00:04.660
One year ago today, here at this Westgate hotel,

00:04.880 --> 00:07.620
I embarked on a life changing adventure.

00:08.320 --> 00:10.720
As I pass on my crown as Mrs.

00:10.721 --> 00:14.641
American, I am filled with gratitude and joy

00:14.642 --> 00:16.981
to have been able to be a part of this journey.

00:17.120 --> 00:21.160
What a year it has been. I'm deeply

00:21.161 --> 00:25.261
and forever grateful for the unwavering support of my husband, Daniel,

00:25.280 --> 00:27.160
and our children, Henry, Charles,

00:27.161 --> 00:28.041
George, Francis,

00:28.042 --> 00:28.721
Lois, Martha,

00:28.722 --> 00:30.101
Mabel and flora.

00:30.440 --> 00:33.820
Your love and encouragement has been my greatest strength.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.040
I'm also so grateful to the Mrs.

00:36.041 --> 00:38.641
American Organization, Elaine and Tana,

00:38.642 --> 00:40.861
and my directors, Jackie and Jolie.

00:41.240 --> 00:44.400
Their dedication has been instrumental in my journey

00:44.401 --> 00:45.821
and I'm so thankful.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.860
Another highlight of my year

00:50.160 --> 00:52.880
was growing and giving birth to my daughter,

00:52.881 --> 00:56.781
Miss Flora Joe. I was pregnant with her during the pageant,

00:56.840 --> 00:59.920
and my due date was just two weeks before the Missus World pageant

00:59.921 --> 01:04.141
in January. Flora was born January 2nd.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.100
And 13 days after she was born,

01:07.720 --> 01:11.300
we checked in to the Missus World pageant here in Las Vegas.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.060
With our supportive family and community,

01:15.560 --> 01:16.720
together, her and I,

01:16.721 --> 01:18.061
we made it happen.

01:18.360 --> 01:22.180
It was a sweet and tender experience that we will cherish forever.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.480
Another cherished memory I hold forever

01:26.481 --> 01:28.681
will be competing on the Missus World stage

01:28.682 --> 01:30.541
while my father watched proudly.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.300
He passed just two weeks after.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.640
His memory continues to be a guiding light in my life

01:36.641 --> 01:38.381
and I miss him everyday.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.100
I know he's been my guardian angel the past Few months.

01:42.680 --> 01:46.960
My reign has allowed me to shine a spotlight on the know Your Farmer,

01:46.961 --> 01:48.581
know your food initiative,

01:48.960 --> 01:51.800
emphasizing the importance of sustainable farming

01:51.801 --> 01:53.581
and food chain diversity.

01:54.120 --> 01:58.260
I love sharing our farm and our story with so many of you.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.120
As I pass on the Crown, I celebrate the achievements,

02:01.121 --> 02:04.621
but more importantly, the friendship this role has allowed me to make.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.020
With all the love and gratitude,

02:07.360 --> 02:10.980
Hannah Neelman, Mrs. American 2023.
