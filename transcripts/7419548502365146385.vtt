00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
this is my easy sushi recipe

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:03.657
because it's birthday season in my house 

00:00:03.658 --> 00:00:05.120
and the birthday boy requested it

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:07.120
and on top of organising all his presents

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.915
baking an elaborate cake and putting on a 

00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:10.240
party for him and all his mates

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:11.970
of course I also have time to source 

00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:13.280
all of the right ingredients

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:15.980
and prepare everybody's own personal favourite sushi

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.840
and that's my story and I'm sticking to it

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:20.640
and funnily enough it's also birthday season at St Pierres 

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:22.320
they're turning 40 and to celebrate

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.875
they're giving away 40,000 pieces of sushi 

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:26.480
on October 1st from 11:00am

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:27.840
and you don't even need to buy anything

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:30.260
you can just roll on up and get some free sushi

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.400
their key ingredients coming direct from Japan

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:34.501
alongside locally sourced items such as the 

00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:35.600
New Zealand King Salmon

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.120
the food is phenomenal so get your free sushi

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.728
pop it on a plate, hide the evidence

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.470
 and your family will be none the wiser
