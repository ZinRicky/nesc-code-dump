00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.760
roll call

00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:02.693
who saw my first anti anxious station 

00:00:02.694 --> 00:00:04.321
and who saw that concept blow up

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:05.761
I was kinda surprised if I'm honest

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:07.983
because what started out as an inside joke 

00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:09.121
that I had with myself

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:11.481
ended up helping me and a whole bunch of other people

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:12.121
you might know that

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:13.713
BraveFace has been a staple of my 

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:15.681
anti anxious station for almost two years

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.641
now and I'm so excited

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:17.681
because we've teamed up

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:20.401
and also looped in a couple of my other favourite local brands

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:23.761
so that you can easily curate a calming and uplifting little space

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:27.641
with the sole intent and purpose of making you feel fkn fabulous

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:30.361
you can pick and choose which products you like to add to your bundle

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:31.721
and whether or not youâ€™d like the tray

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:32.441
and I must admit

00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:35.201
the four words on the tray were the hardest four words I've ever written

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.981
like how difficult to encapsulate your entire ethos into one short sentence?!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But I have this theory in life

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:41.881
that the things that actually terrify you

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:43.481
are the things that you need to run towards

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:44.561
and for an anxious person

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:45.121
that's hard so

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:48.321
this serves as a twice daily reminder to keep showing up for yourself

00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:49.681
and to keep doing brave things

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:50.441
word to the wise

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:53.681
don't get the brave face cool head and the calm mood face mist confused

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:56.721
the face mist acts like therapy and reminds me to feel calm

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.521
and all the Brave Face products are taken orally

00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:00.401
so that you absorb those active ingredients

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:02.641
top it all off with a feel good smoked lavender candle

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:05.407
it's all limited edition and just went live right now
