00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.040
the biggest problem with relationships these days is

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.187
everybody thinks 

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:05.960
“you're supposed to meet my needs”

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:08.240
here's why that's never going to work

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:11.120
People usually have a relationship that goes one of three ways

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:14.490
the “if you don't meet my needs, I'm going to leave” 

00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:16.080
which is pretty immature 

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:19.094
Or the Equality route which is great, 

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:21.573
the “you do your part, I'll do mine” 

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:24.120
but there's no real passion there okay

00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:28.760
and then there's the third relationship that will always work

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:32.200
which is the “I'll do whatever it takes to meet your needs”

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.700
these relationships always work

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.200
Their equally passionate about meeting each other's needs

00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:40.040
because it fuels them every day when they wake up

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:41.600
when they first open their eyes

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.520
they want to meet your needs because it drives them

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:48.762
that is the key essential component to a long lasting relationship
