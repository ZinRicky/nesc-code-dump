00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.133
We have all been lied to 

00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:04.365
Men and women have been lied to

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:09.120
It's so easy for us to compare ourselves with other couples online

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:12.880
compare ourselves with other women who get “princess treatment”

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:17.571
bragging about their men paying for their nails, hair, shopping sprees 

00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:20.280
I am going to be brutally honest with you

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:23.400
that is not princess treatment

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:28.120
princess treatment is how he can support you and emotionally validate you

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:31.760
he's patient with you, he won't let you go to bed upset

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:34.160
You feel safe and vulnerable with him

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:36.840
and he doesn't raise his voice towards you

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:41.040
You can bring up any concerns that you have without him getting upset

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.700
because he can handle it

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.640
he can handle anything that you throw at him emotionally

00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:48.960
he'll handle it with logic and reason

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:52.680
empathy and patience he tries to understand you

00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:55.200
princess treatment is how he talks to you

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.480
how he touches you

00:00:56.481 --> 00:01:00.900
I'm not afraid to admit that I like when I get spoiled with gifts

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.520
makes most women happy and elated

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.080
but I still don't consider that princess treatment

00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:09.880
I think we all need to stop letting social media convince us

00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:12.700
that princess treatment is in lavish gifts

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.160
or things that you buy because princess treatment

00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:18.739
true princess treatment cannot be bought
