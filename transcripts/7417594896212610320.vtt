00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.280
I don't know if it's just me

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:03.152
but I feel like this is the time of the year 

00:00:03.153 --> 00:00:04.400
where most of us get burnt out

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:05.240
because hear me out

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:07.240
but it's been so long since Christmas break

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.560
and yet we've still got all of the busy months to get through

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:11.360
so I'm calling it Self Care September

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:13.572
and honestly it's been so long since I've had 

00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:15.160
a facial or any kind of pampering

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:17.400
so I decided to treat myself to a luxurious

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:20.160
Red Door spa service with Elizabeth Arden at Farmers

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.680
and I might have been living under a rock

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:24.600
but I had no idea that you could get an Elizabeth Arden facial

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:25.920
at selected Farmers stores

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:28.480
they do an express for 15 minutes or you can do 

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:29.760
a 60 or 90 minute facial

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:32.120
and the cost of the booking is redeemable on products

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.155
which I think is great 

00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:35.040
my amazing aesthetician Jobyda 

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:38.680
decided I would benefit most from a Lift and Firm Ceramide Facial

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:40.960
we started off with a double cleanse and an exfoliation

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:42.560
before giving me a lifting facial

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.720
massage with the Advanced Ceramide Capsules

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:47.960
we did a face mask which was just so satisfying to peel off

00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:50.280
and then she used their unique Skintervention tool

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.640
which I've never seen before

00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:52.960
but honestly I want one

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:54.780
it used light and heat to reduce the 

00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:56.600
appearance of fine lines and wrinkles

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:58.400
leaving you with firmer and smoother skin

00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:01.320
I walked out of there feeling so relaxed and at this time of the year

00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:03.160
and for me at this time of the month

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:04.440
I really needed that 

00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:06.680
Jobyda show me what she used on me during my treatment

00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:08.348
and also recommended a couple of things 

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:09.600
that I should be using at home

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:11.800
and one of them was these Advanced Ceramide Capsules

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:13.220
which I've been using at home 

00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:14.120
for over a year now

00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:15.720
and these are precise premeasured

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:17.291
biodegradable capsules with 

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:18.920
high potency targeted actives

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:21.460
and they feel absolutely beautiful on the skin
