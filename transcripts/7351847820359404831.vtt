00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.160
I got this new necklace and I have not added a new necklace to like

00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:06.121
my vibe in so long

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:07.921
and I just cleaned it

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:10.721
I am so obsessed with it

00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:13.181
also if you've never gotten vintage sterling silver 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.840
I cannot tell you how satisfying it is

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.681
to clean the gunk off of vintage Sterling silver

00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:21.361
in another life I think I definitely worked with Sterling silver

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:24.381
like either I was jeweler or as a cleaner or something

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.520
cause I do that a lot in my free time cause it's really fun

00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:27.681
I love silver

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:28.921
this is what it looked like when I bought it

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:31.561
do you see how like black and like dirty this necklace is

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:34.481
like I love it but it's like black and dirty and like oxidite

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:37.121
also I spent $63 on it which is like a little bit much

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:38.881
but it is 53 ounces of silver

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.200
a heavy necklace

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.941
in the way that I gauge whether or not I should buy Sterling silver

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.080
also I don't know if this is right

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:46.721
but this is my like biggest silver purchase

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:50.601
it's $200 it was 400 leva (for my 22nd birthday) I got in Bulgaria translates $200

00:00:50.602 --> 00:00:53.101
and this is 64 ounces of Sterling silver

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.380
to be fair it is I think like hand

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.560
apparently it's like hands made so that also makes it more expensive

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:02.941
but since this was 64 ounces for $200

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.880
this being 53 ounces for $63 feel like was a good deal

00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:10.201
also now that it's clean

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.061
look how good it looks anyways

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.520
also I realized on the days that I wanna show more cleve

00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:17.641
I have to wear less necklaces cause they kind of like

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:18.241
they all just sit

00:01:18.242 --> 00:01:20.921
sit here and interrupt on vibe

00:01:20.922 --> 00:01:21.941
you know them tryna

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.100
I also got these from Arizona

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.926
that's my new jewelry
