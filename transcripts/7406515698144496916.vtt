WEBVTT


00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.440
we slowly starting to defrost here

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:02.520
 in the Southern Hemisphere

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:03.806
which means our Father's Day 

00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:04.960
is right around the corner

00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:07.400
and I'm planning on hosting a Father's Day brunch out here

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:09.320
but not while my patio looks like this

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:11.000
and I don't know if it's just cause emotionally

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.600
I'm really ready for some warmer weather

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.427
but lately I've been feeling that spring 

00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:15.720
cleaning energy possessing me

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.600
if you wanna give the father figure in your life

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.320
and not so subtle hint to get cleaning

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:21.160
might I suggest a Karcher for Father's Day

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:23.000
I highly recommend their range of water blasters

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.720
and also as someone who's renovating

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:26.840
another idea is the wet and dry vacuums

00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:28.609
you can plug some power tools directly into it 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.170
so if you're sanding, for example 

00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:31.640
it will extract all of that dust

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:33.680
and bag it before it has a chance to get into

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:35.280
literally every corner of your house

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.347
and that one feature has saved my sanity 

00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:38.457
more than a few times 

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:40.664
anyway it always horrifies me how filthy the 

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:42.480
exterior of a house can get in winter

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:44.680
if you've been following along on our renovation journey

00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:47.163
you'll know that this patio isn't even a year old 

00:00:47.164 --> 00:00:49.800
And surprisingly this isn't even the first time that I've cleaned it

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:52.329
but a side effect of being alive that they don't tell you

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.511
 is the sheer amount of admin you'll have to do 

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:56.240
just to stay on top of all of the jobs

00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:58.520
but one thing I've learnt in my 33 years on this planet

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.160
is having the right tool for the job makes life so much easier

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.138
I cleaned the tiles with the paver attachment 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:04.600
and gave the furniture a once over

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:06.320
and now the space is looking brand new again

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:08.478
ready for some Father's Day festivities
