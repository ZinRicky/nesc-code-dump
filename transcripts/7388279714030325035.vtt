00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.400
pack with me for a little parents

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.760
weekend getaway. we are only gone for 

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:05.000
like 24 hours and I can way too much stuff

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:05.920
but so next time

00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:07.840
he's super cute I think I love this time

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.920
and when you turn up so we are going for 24 hours

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.960
like I just said and I've no idea what we're doing

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.920
we're either going to have a 24 hour rot

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:17.680
and do nothing but relax and watch TV and read books

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:18.600
or like

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:19.640
a pool or check out the beach

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:21.280
downtown area who even knows

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.420
so we're packing a little bit of everything

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.360
packing my bathing suit cover up

00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:29.000
just in case we go to the pool or hit the beach

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.240
one case the beach so that's probably not gonna happen

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:32.980
but just in case you never know

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.640
now for the outfit we need pair of pajamas

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:38.980
these might be the only thing I wear if we decide to bedrock all weekend

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.800
and I know my husband is from practice sweatshirt

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:44.020
that man lights our room at 65 degrees and does not care if I'm freezing

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.560
show me that and all different kinds of outfits

00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:49.800
because you never know what you're gonna feel like

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:50.960
don't know what the weather is going to be like

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:53.800
there's apparently a Hurricane making its way towards the Gulf

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:55.280
so we could have really windy

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:56.840
rainy weather or maybe sunny

00:00:56.841 --> 00:01:01.120
and how you do it so I got all the things just in case

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.360
I'd wear dresses if it's really hot in here

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.100
cause sometimes it's got a little bit of breeze

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.080
and I'm obsessed with this two piece set

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:09.620
it is so cute but

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.520
but it is open and these are all tasty bras

00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:15.600
and when it is 100 degrees in here

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:18.320
those things slide off so pack it because I like it

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:19.500
might not get to wear that one

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.960
and a two piece car ride set

00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:23.440
because girls gotta come to the car

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:26.580
but I can't lounge and drive at the same time I don't want

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.980
and there we go
