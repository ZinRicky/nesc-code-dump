00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.880
the next time I feel like parenting is hard

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:03.920
I'm gonna remind myself how much harder it is

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:06.186
parenting three children on the side of a mountain 

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:06.720
at 0 degrees

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.480
while they're flying at speed on skis

00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:10.209
compared to that, the day to day is a 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.120
walk in the fkn park

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:12.400
it's day three in Queenstown

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:15.200
and it's just occurred to me that the last time my children saw snow

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:16.267
was six years ago 

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:18.041
it was 2018, I was pregnant with baby girl 

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:19.280
and the boys were six and four

00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:21.120
so olive has never encountered snow

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.280
and the first thing she wanted to do was eat it, naturally 

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.280
we got all of our shit where it needed to be

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:26.720
which was a workout within itself

00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:28.440
I was tired before we even began

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.200
and for some reason

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:32.120
I thought it would be a good idea if I taught the children how to ski myself

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.840
despite the fact that I haven't skied in about 15 years

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:37.360
Ok so I don't know if this is in my head or if it genuinely helped

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:39.440
but I feel like it genuinely helped? anyway

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:40.624
you know how I said I was keeping

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:41.880
 this trip a surprise from the kids

00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:44.440
well recently I dug out the rollerblades and the roller skates

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:47.360
and I got the kids on them for a couple hours a week for the last few weeks

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:49.920
and I could be wrong but I feel like it's kinda comparable to skiing

00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:51.400
I was definitely pleasantly surprised

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:53.400
at how quickly they found their footing with the ski

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.188
we practice for a while in the beginners meadow 

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.120
before taking them up the chairlift 

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:57.760
and doing a few big runs

00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:59.760
and little olive was just off like a rocket

00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:02.320
which was both impressive and deeply concerning

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:03.480
every time somebody bailed

00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:04.679
I tried unsuccessfully

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.080
to suppress a memory that I have

00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:08.240
of watching my brother break his leg on a mountain

00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:09.239
not too far from this one

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.200
 while he was lying there

00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.560
I fell through a hole in the ice

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:13.720
and nearly got dragged away by an underground stream

00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:15.360
and he had the audacity to laugh

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:17.800
my poor fkn parents, that must have been the day from hell

00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:18.675
no wonder they split up 

00:01:18.676 --> 00:01:19.880
And that's a roundabout way of saying

00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:22.394
I was surprised at how much my inner child showed up today

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.480
I parent her almost as much as my actual children

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:27.120
I quietener her down with a mulled wine in a 65 degree sauna

00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:28.400
which was actually insane

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:30.600
And because I literally devoured a court of thorns and roses

00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:31.360
Iâ€™m onto book two

00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:33.950
which I had to buy on the iPad cause I couldn't find it anywhere
