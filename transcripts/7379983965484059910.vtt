00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.800
bake with me as I prep food for my husband's boys weekend at the cottage

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.760
I started off by making a couple loaves of sourdough bread

00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:09.820
because you always need some bread

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.160
and then I made a big tray of macaroni and cheese

00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:15.500
just a perfect little snack or lunch

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.640
and then their main meal was going to be some sourdough pizza

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:20.200
so I made the dough the night before 4

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:23.400
and then I just rolled it out in the morning and I suck the crust with cheese

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:26.800
so delicious because I wanted the pizza to just be stored in the freezer

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:28.240
so it was super quick for them

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:29.280
they could just throw in the oven

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:32.380
it's ready to go the secret is to pre bake the crust

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.540
put on all the toppings let it cool down and then just wrap it up

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.240
and then of course

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:37.760
I had to make a couple of treats

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:42.000
so I made some chocolate chip cookies and some sourdough banana bread muffins

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.540
they're so good and yeah that's everything
