00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.000
So excited to try out this new camera from wise.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.480
Going on a trip soon and I need to make sure I can

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.720
see what's going on in my backyard.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.400
It is. Camera moves 3 60

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.560
and that it's weather resistant is just perfect

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.280
what I need.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.660
I'm also super impressed with the picture quality

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.460
and how easy it was to install.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.320
Just look how it rotates 3 60.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.720
When I'm away from the homestead

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.560
I really wanna be able to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.340
see what's going on with the animals.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.920
And this camera even tracks the animals.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.420
Look, it's tracking my cow

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.540
so I can be

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.980
anywhere in the world and keep an eye on my baby.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.240
It even follows the dogs in the backyard.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.940
I can keep an eye on everyone.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.200
And with the app I can record and save any clips.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.440
I have other cameras

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.680
and I'm super impressed with this one.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.180
And with the price you can't beat it.
