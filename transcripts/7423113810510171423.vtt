00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.280
oh hey look

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:02.760
a Planned Parenthood yeah no

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:03.800
that's a fake Planned Parenthood

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:04.480
what are you talking about

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:09.200
it says plan choices and women use all those words on purpose

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:10.680
they use all those words on purpose to lure unsuspecting women

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:12.560
into thinking that they're gonna be offered all the choices

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:14.480
but they're just gonna be convinced not to get an ab0rs!on

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:14.960
okay well

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:16.120
if they don't offer ab0rs!on

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:18.340
then why does their website literally say that they do

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.220
because they're lying

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.000
most of these fake clinics don't even have a single doctor on staff

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.420
to perform the medical services that they say that they do

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.360
that's bad okay

00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:29.840
well I guess performing ultrasounds on pregnant women can't hurt

00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:32.200
yeah if the staff had medical licenses

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:35.040
that they don't and so they're performing ultrasounds on pregnant women

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:36.480
and could miss serious conditions

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:38.840
like ectopic pregnancies that's bad

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:39.440
okay well

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:42.260
at least they can't harm women who already had ab0rs!on right

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.900
no they tell those women that they can reverse their ab0rs!on can you

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.080
yep

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.940
that's common sense up here

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.640
but you don't know that

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:57.120
this clinic essentially telling women that they can reverse their abortion

00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:59.500
so literally their pin post on Facebook

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.520
I fear Okey dokey

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.520
okay so our elected officials must be doing something about this right

00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.920
well a bunch of them have actually already passed laws

00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.060
that force doctors to say that abortions can be reversed

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.660
my god I'm itchy everywhere

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.400
oh I know

00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:15.840
okay there's a presidential election coming up

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:16.940
what can we do

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.360
when Kamala Harris was age of California

00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:22.220
she actually mandated these fake clinics to stop lying to women

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840
okay okay

00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:24.720
and then what about uh

00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:25.840
Donald Trump and JD Dance

00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:28.660
they don't really have a plan about how to protect women

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.400
okay so they don't have a plan to protect women from the fake clinics

00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:32.560
but it's not like they have a plan

00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:35.460
to make it harder for women to access the real ones right

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.060
uh

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.360
you know I gotta go

00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:42.660
wait didn't Donald Trump probably pay for ab0rs!ions

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.220
probably he's just doesnâ€™t want you to
