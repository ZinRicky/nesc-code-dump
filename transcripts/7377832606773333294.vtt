00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm gonna show you how to make your own vanilla extract at home.

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.121
It's easier than you think it is.

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:06.841
These are Grade a Madagascar vanilla extract beans.

00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:09.061
Will smell the vanilla through the bag that strong.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.960
And to make vanilla extract,

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:15.681
you just need to soak these vanilla beans in some sort of alcohol.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.001
I'm gonna use vodka today,

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.041
and I'm gonna use some pretty cheap vodka

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:20.601
that I just picked up from the package store.

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:21.901
And use Bourbon,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.280
you can use whiskey,

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.641
you can use Grey Goose,

00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:26.641
you can use the most expensive vodka you can find.

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:29.161
And I've heard Bourbon vanilla extract is really good.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.101
But today I'm just gonna use the cheap vodka.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.880
is gonna extract the essence of the vanilla out of the vanilla bean.

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:35.801
Few ways you can do it.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.721
You can just shove the beans into the bottle,

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:38.961
pour the vodka in,

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:40.361
let it sit for six to eight weeks,

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:41.361
and call it good.

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:45.281
Or you can split the beans open and scrape the vanilla bean paste out,

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:46.741
shove that in with the bottle,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.000
and mix it up with the vodka.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:49.481
That makes it work a little bit faster,

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.861
and then the vanilla essence, or extract,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.340
depending on where you're from,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.700
um, will become darker and more potent.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.720
Uh, you could also do the quick method,

00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:00.761
which I'm not gonna do today.

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:02.681
I'm just gonna let mine sit in the bottle for six to eight weeks.

00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:04.801
Since I have a lot of Extract already.

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:07.001
But what you can do is put them in a pressure cooker,

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.161
and I heard that works really well,

00:01:09.162 --> 00:01:11.361
and I'm probably gonna try that out next time, um,

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:12.441
cause I actually wanna see if that works.

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:15.561
But you can put it in a pressure cooker with the vodka and do it for,

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:18.661
you know, pressure it for a few hours and then it's ready to go.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.680
Don't know if that works,

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:20.921
but you can always try.

00:01:20.922 --> 00:01:23.761
I put my vanilla extract in these kind of bottles,

00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:25.981
and you can see this is how much I've gone through.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.300
I use vanilla extract in pretty much all my cooking around here.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.140
So I'm gonna take these old beans out.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.160
Of course, the little ripping bit didn't work,

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.221
so I need to go grab some Scissors.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.520
This is what the beans look like when they come out the bag.

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:46.321
I'm gonna split some of these beans, cause I want them to work faster.

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:50.521
Slice the bean down the middle to open up the inside of the bean.

00:01:50.522 --> 00:01:55.401
And that's all that vanilla bean paste in there that we wanna extract.

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:58.541
Let's start putting the beans inside the bottle open.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.600
Gonna leave the rest of these now.

00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:05.001
I'm actually going to try the canning method,

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:06.721
so I'm gonna leave some of these back.

00:02:06.722 --> 00:02:08.001
I'm just gonna add the vodka.

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:11.041
I as I said, I got this really cheap vodka.

00:02:11.042 --> 00:02:13.821
Was around $10, I believe.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.560
Make sure the vanilla bean is completely Covered

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.001
and I'm gonna leave a little room at the top

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:22.761
cause I wanna be able to shake the.

00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:25.281
The bottle and have the vanilla bean squash around in there.

00:02:25.282 --> 00:02:27.941
I'm gonna leave this in the pantry for six weeks now,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.080
and then every week or two, when I walk by and notice she's there,

00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:32.781
I'm gonna shake the bottle

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.680
and that will help the vanilla bean breakdown.

00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:36.841
So you gonna need leave a little room in the top there

00:02:36.842 --> 00:02:40.441
so you can shake the bottle and have the beans slush around.

00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:41.761
This package of vanilla beans

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:44.521
could probably do two to three bottles at this size

00:02:44.522 --> 00:02:46.101
bottle of vanilla extract.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.200
So that's a great savings. If you do a lot of baking,

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.801
a lot of cooking with vanilla extract,

00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:52.201
I definitely recommend trying this.

00:02:52.202 --> 00:02:54.501
This is so easy to make your own.
