00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.080
what do we do with all the milk from our family dairy cow

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:07.040
welcome to the series that explains what we do daily with about a gallon of milk

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:08.840
when our Cora first in latation

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:10.560
should bring us four to five gallons of milk a day

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.800
right now she's in about the 18th month of lactation

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:15.360
so he's given us a solid gallon

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:16.560
a gallon a half a day

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:20.040
so with our family we could probably drink about a gallon of milk a day

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:22.880
but I also still make lots of different things with our milk

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:24.740
today I'm gonna make some rice pudding

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.720
I ate this a lot as a child

00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:28.120
but it always came from a can

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:29.720
so it's interesting to make my own

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.320
and I start with some milk

00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:33.600
I'm did skim the cream off the top of this milk

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.320
I added a cup of sugar a half a cup of rice

00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:41.920
and a little bit of salt this pink Himalayan salt is really kinda strong

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:43.480
so I cannot wait to put less salt in

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:44.760
because a little bit too salty

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:49.140
I'm gonna let that boil down and simmer for about an hour

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.280
and then I added in a little bit more cream

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:55.720
because this actually boiled over and spilt milk everywhere

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:59.000
so it needs a little bit more liquid content to it

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.000
so I added a little bit more cream on top

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:05.340
and then I added some canned jam that I canned in the spring and it was delish
