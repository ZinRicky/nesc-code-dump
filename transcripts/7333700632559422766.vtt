After being gone for a week,

00:01.440 --> 00:03.980
my husband's on a six hour flight back home,

00:04.040 --> 00:06.040
and what better way to surprise him

00:06.040 --> 00:07.920
than with some fresh vanilla ice cream

00:07.920 --> 00:10.400
and some gooey chocolate brownies?

00:10.400 --> 00:12.880
I started making my custard for my ice cream

00:12.880 --> 00:14.120
with some milk,

00:14.120 --> 00:15.200
vanilla, sugar,

00:15.200 --> 00:16.540
and some eggs.

00:16.720 --> 00:19.000
Combined my egg yolks with my sugar

00:19.000 --> 00:21.400
and then slowly put some of the warm milk in there

00:21.400 --> 00:22.440
just to get it warm

00:22.440 --> 00:24.860
and then added it to the rest of my milk.

00:25.160 --> 00:26.680
Strained all the vanilla out

00:26.680 --> 00:29.160
and then let it come down to room temperature

00:29.160 --> 00:31.460
before transferring it over to the fridge.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.280
In the meantime,

00:32.280 --> 00:33.920
I started on my brownie batter,

00:33.920 --> 00:35.520
mixed all of my dry ingredients,

00:35.520 --> 00:37.280
and then added my wet ones,

00:37.280 --> 00:39.120
which were some eggs,

00:39.120 --> 00:41.160
some oil, and some water.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.440
I then combined that mixture with my dry ingredients,

00:44.440 --> 00:45.760
gave it a really good mix,

00:45.760 --> 00:47.880
and then transfer that over to my loaf pan

00:47.880 --> 00:49.580
before putting that in the oven.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.600
Then I pulled out my custard and churned it.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.800
When I hit the consistency of soft serve,

00:54.800 --> 00:57.480
I transferred it over to a separate container

00:57.480 --> 00:59.860
to pop it in the freezer for a couple hours.

01:00.080 --> 01:00.720
At this point

01:00.720 --> 01:02.640
my brownie was good to go,

01:02.640 --> 01:04.400
so I pulled it out of the oven

01:04.400 --> 01:06.660
and let it cool completely,

01:07.040 --> 01:08.800
and then my husband walked through the door,

01:08.800 --> 01:11.720
so I decided to serve him up some of that brownie

01:11.720 --> 01:12.920
and ice cream.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.800
This is one of his favorite Sweet treats.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.100
So I'm excited that he really liked it.
