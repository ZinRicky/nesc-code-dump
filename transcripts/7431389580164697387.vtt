00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.720
Once it clicks that you can make anything you want from scratch,

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:04.181
yes, including Snickers,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.160
you'll never go back to buying the ultra processed junk again.

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:08.681
I started by making my new got

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:11.241
first by whipping egg white until stiff peaks formed,

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:12.441
then cooking the unrefined

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:16.041
natural sugars into a thick caramel at 200 2 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.801
I slowly drizzled this hot syrup into the whipped egg white,

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:21.041
but quickly moved it to a bowl with a hand mixer,

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:23.521
which worked much better. This was like marshmallow fluff,

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:25.281
it was so smooth and satiny.

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:27.161
I poured the fluff into a butter dish,

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:28.881
although I would use Parchment paper next time,

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:31.281
then move that to the fridge to firm up for a few hours.

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:33.401
Then I got to making the caramel filling with butter,

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:34.921
coconut sugar, water and cream.

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:37.441
I chopped up some almonds and added those into the thick caramel

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:39.881
and then spread this on top of my chilled newgot.

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:41.041
While that firmed up in the fridge,

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:43.561
I made my dark chocolate. A very quick process.

00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:47.041
Lastly, I cut the newgot and caramel nut filling into small pieces,

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.601
dipped each piece in the chocolate,

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:51.121
then placed in the fridge to firm up for a few minutes.

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:51.441
Afterwards,

00:00:51.442 --> 00:00:55.361
I dunked each Snickers again for an extra thick double dunked candy.

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:57.281
I can't tell you how good these were.

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:58.681
They're actually drool worthy

00:00:58.682 --> 00:00:59.881
and if I keep making them,

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:01.001
I'll get better at the shape.

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.521
I can confidently say I feel good About feeding my kids a Snickers bar.

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:07.061
As long as it's homemade with real ingredients.
