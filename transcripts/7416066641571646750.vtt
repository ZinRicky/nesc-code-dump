00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.180
do you feel the vibes okay good

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.800
let me tell you my vision

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:05.520
my kids want to share a room in the new house

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.760
but one was an animal theme and one was a Dinosaur theme

00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:10.840
so I thought how can I merge these two ideas together

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.620
and I thought of a mountain theme

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.200
on one wall we're gonna have this big mountain mural

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:16.800
and when I think of sleeping in the mountains

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.000
I think of the stars and the beautiful night sky

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.680
so I had to get this Galaxy Star projector

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:24.520
it has music it's Bluetooth

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:27.660
it has a beautiful night galaxy sky

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.360
The Galaxy Starlight is going to make them feel like

00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:31.760
one is sleeping with the animals

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:33.520
and one is sleeping with the dinosaurs

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:37.020
it is going to help set the whole mood for the entire room

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.480
and of course I had to try it out to see if it fit the vibe

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:41.160
and my kids are already so obsessed

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:43.120
this is their favorite thing at that time

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.880
so if your kids love the Galaxy Stars

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:47.764
all the things you wanna get this too
