00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.920
The reality is, I would choose the bear.

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:02.681
You would choose the bear.

00:00:02.682 --> 00:00:04.161
We would all choose the bear. Collectively,

00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:05.881
as the internet is female presenting people,

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:07.441
we all would choose the bear.

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:08.881
And I can't speak for everyone's reasons

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:09.841
why they would choose the bear.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.881
But the reason I told my husband is this.

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:15.381
Because a bear doesn't hate people the same way men hate women.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.140
And if I'm gonna die anyway,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.620
I would choose the dignity and death of being mauled by a bear.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.040
Then a scary, scary man who wants to take his time.

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:25.921
Because the scariest of bears

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:29.261
will never be scarier than the scariest of men.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.060
And if I'm gonna die anyway,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.920
I will take the dignity and death of a natural death

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:35.261
from a wild animal.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.260
Then I would take the creative torture that a man can provide.
