00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.920
bake with me as I make some food to bring to my very pregnant friend

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:06.640
first thing I wanted to do is make some chicken pot pie

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:08.240
this is just really freezer friendly

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.520
the perfect thing to have postpartum

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:14.280
a quick homemade meal that you can just pop into the oven

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.840
and this is with a sourdough crust

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.560
and then I made some granola

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:19.360
this is not pregnancy related at all

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:22.200
it's just really fun to gift and also delicious

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:25.860
and I also got these cute bakery bags that I wanted to try as well

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.520
so once it cooled I just added in some chocolate and coconut flakes

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:32.800
it was so good and then I made two different kinds of muffins

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.960
firstly some orange cranberry ones

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:37.220
these were so fresh and delicious

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.400
and then also a classic banana chocolate chip and walnut muffin

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:44.400
this is with sourdough so it's fermented overnight

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:47.040
and then lastly I made some nut butter snack balls

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.520
I just thought this would be perfect for middle of the night

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:54.180
breastfeeding sessions and then I just put everything into a cute little basket

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.520
added some homemade labels

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.160
and I also included these cute little baby overalls

00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:00.960
it just made me so happy and there you go

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.520
that is my basket of goodies

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.598
