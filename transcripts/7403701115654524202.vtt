00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.240
I feel like the internet needs some basic rules of engagement

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:05.520
making tens of thousands of people think that you are in a crisis situation

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.480
or you or your children's life might be in state

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.680
because your husband is going through a mental health crisis

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.440
when in reality you're just telling a story about what happened a few months ago

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:13.920
because you want this to go out

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:16.991
you know to as many people as possible to raise awareness and help

00:00:16.992 --> 00:00:18.480
 it really rubs me the wrong way

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:21.320
it's obviously not the worst thing that someone has done for clicks and views

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:25.080
however it's really difficult to watch people continuously cross boundaries of

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:26.040
like what is normal

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.720
rational and sane just for a platform

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.440
just for some views it's getting really frustrating to watch

00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:32.720
just like lack of basic fucking decorum

00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:34.840
like I understand that the situation that happened to you

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:36.840
and you wanted to paint the picture right

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:38.680
but like you have said hey

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:39.720
story time right

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:41.640
like this is what happened a few months ago

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:46.120
making it seem as if you are currently in an abusive situation with a man

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:47.800
where there is potential for like

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.520
life threatening issues and like

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:54.720
lives at risk for the sake of a better story is weird and wrong

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.840
and you should not have done that

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:59.600
I wish people in general reevaluated the way they act on the internet

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.560
and reevaluated their own like

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.760
moral limits on the internet

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:09.120
just like in general I I think that we are really losing the fucking plot

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:14.220
and losing how to interact with basic human decency on the internet

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.680
and we are forgetting like the impact of what we do in the name of going viral

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:19.520
in the name of you know

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:21.040
getting some money in the name of

00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:22.400
you know getting some followers

00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:24.720
the internet is like a public town square right

00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:28.920
like it works the best when we are just being basically decent human beings

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.880
and making tens of thousands of people think that

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:32.800
you are currently actively in danger

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:35.292
life threatening danger is not cool

00:01:35.293 --> 00:01:36.574
 please reevaluate
