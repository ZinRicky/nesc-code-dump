00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.120
So today I'm gonna make sourdough chicken pot pie

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:07.021
with sourdough biscuits on top.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.760
This is one of my favourite recipes, and my kids normally like it,

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:13.721
but they're going through this phase that absolutely everything I cook,

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:14.921
they just can't stand.

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:16.241
They're always starving to death.

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:17.561
But soon as I cook something,

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:19.041
they just refuse to eat it.

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:23.141
They want to survive off a diet of popsicles and rainbow dust.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.580
That's kids logic for you.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.960
So anyway, I hear I'm starting off chopping up some butter,

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:30.381
I add some flour.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.280
This is a basic biscuit recipe.

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:35.001
I just add some sourdough starter into it,

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.661
and then it sits here and rest for a little bit

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.100
on the kitchen counter.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.220
Later on, I cook some frozen chicken tenderloins, because why not?

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.400
So I had this bright idea to let my daughter help me make dessert,

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:50.201
so maybe she'd be interested in eating it

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.361
if I actually had her help me make it.

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:53.501
And that normally works.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.800
This time it was a fail because she distracted me,

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:56.881
and then I ended up

00:00:56.882 --> 00:00:58.841
forgetting to put the baking soda in the cinnamon rolls,

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:00.861
so they were absolutely terrible.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.920
While I'm cooking it,

00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:03.961
I'm really thinking, like,

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:07.961
what can I cook that actually I like and my kids will actually eat?

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:10.421
And right now it's down to just, like, spaghetti.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.560
Spaghetti Bolognese.

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:14.481
That is it. And I don't even like spaghetti Bolognese.

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:16.441
I'm just eating it out of frustration. Because,

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:17.281
like, if I Cook it.

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:20.041
At least I'll eat. And we don't have to argue at the table. Here.

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:23.441
I'm putting the cream cap in to make this nice and creamy.

00:01:23.442 --> 00:01:26.321
This was actually so delicious and the kids just.

00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:28.781
I literally had to force feed this to them.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.640
Um, like,

00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:31.401
you know, you won't leave the table

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:33.981
and you won't have the disgusting dessert that didn't work out

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.340
until you eat some.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.960
This is my favourite part,

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:37.961
cutting out the biscuits.

00:01:37.962 --> 00:01:39.601
I normally have my daughter help me with this part,

00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:40.161
but I don't know,

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:41.701
she disappeared on the way she went.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.560
At this point,

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:43.841
I was absolutely exhausted

00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:45.681
and I didn't really care if the kids ate it or not.

00:01:45.682 --> 00:01:46.981
I just wanted to be done.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.060
So I sat down and I enjoyed every little bit of my sourdough biscuit.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.460
Chicken pot pie.
