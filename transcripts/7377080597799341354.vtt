00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.340
Update on my life.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.620
Do you see the boxes?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.380
I finally found a place to live as a single mom.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.720
Moving in with my boyfriend for the first time.

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:16.901
So I'm super excited.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.080
I actually think this process of moving in with him

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:21.881
has been really good for our relationship

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:23.601
because we have had to face some stress.

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:25.281
Like, our relationships pretty chill.

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:26.201
We don't really do anything.

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:27.161
There's no stress.

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:28.241
And this was pretty stressful.

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:30.841
Like, every place we went to go look at was, like,

00:00:30.842 --> 00:00:32.161
rented before we could move in.

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:34.001
And it would be like, the perfect dream home,

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.401
and then we'd be crushed, and then we'd be like,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:36.701
back, and then it's like,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.240
really been annoying.

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:41.801
It's amazing how hard it is to find a place to rent that's affordable

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.001
when you even have, like,

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.961
a decent amount of money between the two of you.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:49.641
So we move in next week.

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:50.841
I'm super excited.

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.361
It actually works out really well.

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:55.401
My kids are gonna be going on a camping trip with their dad.

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:57.921
The way it was scheduled is really cute.

00:00:57.922 --> 00:01:02.761
It was like his five day visit and then a camping trip, and then his,

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.801
like, his summer vacation and then his five day visit.

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:09.381
So it butted up in a really cute way to make it so, um,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.400
they're pretty much there a lot of June.

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:16.681
But that actually worked out in my favor, cause now when I'm moving,

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:19.441
I can do it like Seamlessly and easily

00:01:19.442 --> 00:01:21.921
without having to also entertain them and,

00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:24.121
you know, keep them busy and safe and happy,

00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:25.801
but also move and like that,

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:27.621
do that, like, fucking dance and shuffle.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.560
When someone means to do something for you,

00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:32.321
for harm, but you have a good heart,

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:34.941
that shit will always come out in your benefit.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.020
So I am super excited my kids don't have to change school district

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.000
because one of my kids is disabled and she's on an IEP.

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:44.561
I did not want her to have to, like,

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.641
start a whole new school,

00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:46.321
start new friends,

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:48.361
cause she already had to do that last year,

00:01:48.362 --> 00:01:49.361
2 years ago or whatever.

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:52.401
So it, like, fits all of our needs.

00:01:52.402 --> 00:01:52.961
It even, like,

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:54.801
fixes a few of the issues we have here.

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:56.841
Like, this place is weird. The way you get to the backyard.

00:01:56.842 --> 00:01:57.961
I still have to put my dog on a leash.

00:01:57.962 --> 00:01:58.521
I can't just, like,

00:01:58.522 --> 00:01:59.761
open the door and let her in the backyard.

00:01:59.762 --> 00:02:01.401
So, um,

00:02:01.402 --> 00:02:03.121
I'm super excited.

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:07.881
And so now we get to all of the packing and all that,

00:02:07.882 --> 00:02:09.681
so I will bring you along.

00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:12.001
Also, my phone took a shit for a while.

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:12.961
My phone, like,

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:14.801
wasn't really working or help, like,

00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:16.201
wasn't letting me record Tik Toks.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.321
So I had to get a new phone.

00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:20.001
So there's been a lot that's happened in, like, two weeks or whatever,

00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:21.521
so I've missed you.

00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:23.521
I love you. I'm gonna get to packing,

00:02:23.522 --> 00:02:25.101
but I'm gonna bring you along
