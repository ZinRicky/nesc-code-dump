00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.880
If you wanna make everyone fall in love with you..

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:04.160
here's what you should do!

00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:06.640
this one thing will help you make friends

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:09.680
and build stronger connections with other people.

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.036
When people first meet other people 

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:14.720
and they're trying to have a conversation

00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:16.920
they'll either go one of two routes

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:19.300
A) they relate it back to themselves

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.320
or B) ask a question about what they just told you

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:26.960
People think that relating things is a good thing,

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:28.920
but here's why it's actually not.

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.520
When you wanna get to know people

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:32.360
that's not actually what you want to do

00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:34.220
You wanna talk about them.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.920
Most people love talking about themselves

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:39.760
people love to hear their name

00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:41.111
they love to brag 

00:00:41.112 --> 00:00:43.440
if you allow someone to do this

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:44.720
they'll fall in love with you

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:47.840
Next time someone is trying to share something about themselves to you

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.060
instead of relating it back to yourself

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.680
try asking them questions

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:55.640
for example if someone said they really enjoyed their dinner last night

00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:58.960
Instead of saying “oh, I did too I really liked my dinner last night”

00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:01.520
what you can do instead is ask some questions

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:03.680
what did you cook? did you order out?

00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:06.200
what kind of food was it? what did you really like about it?

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:07.840
Stop relating everything back to you

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:12.360
if you want to really get to know people and build stronger connections

00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:15.440
Because people love to talk about themselves

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:18.000
It’s the easiest way when you meet someone

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.940
go up to them and ask them questions

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.600
it'll make them feel seen, heard and you'll make them feel truly special

00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:29.746
that is the key to building strong connections in your life.
