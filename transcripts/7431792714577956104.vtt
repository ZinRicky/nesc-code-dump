00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.040
recommend for almost all couples you take your paychecks

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:05.200
put it in the joint checking account okay

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:10.800
don't don't do that Doctor Zoe and I'm here to tell you not to do that

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:14.340
this man is recommending that couples should put

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.860
their paychecks directly into the joint account first

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.780
and then the joint account like pays them a little stipend each

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.700
why is this in particular harmful towards women

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.520
I'm also having a joint account

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:32.560
we opened a joint account the other day for the first time um

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:33.800
because my partner's from the UK

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.980
we need we need to do it for the visa

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.800
but getting paid into your joint account

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:43.340
and then getting a stipend means that your partner is basically

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.100
mutually giving you a little bit of pocket money

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.840
and has complete oversight over you

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.100
what you spend your money on and your finances

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.880
this approach does not account for when things go wrong

00:00:56.881 --> 00:01:00.240
this approach is designed to and is a

00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:01.520
is a basically hoax

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:07.880
back to the era where women couldn't leave domestic violence

00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:11.020
or just couldn't leave for whatever reason

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.040
because they didn't have the financial independence to do so

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:20.060
and your partner has complete oversight into how much money you're getting

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.480
they can track your spending more easily and financial abuse is on the rise

00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:30.080
it's one of the newer recognised categories of abuse

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:37.980
but is very much uh valid and very very severe form of abuse in fact

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.380
almost all physical abuse is preceded by financial abuse

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.420
it's a part of the abuse cycle

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.460
the abuser needs to make sure that you can't get away

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.340
even in situations where the couple wanna stay together and then start abuse

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.640
I believe that you should still have complete control of your paychecks

00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:00.620
and they should go into your account

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.960
and as a woman like this is very gendered

00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:05.880
this issue just because

00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:08.560
you know we've just had the 50 year anniversary of women

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:10.600
being able to get their own credit card

00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:16.320
it was not that long ago that men had complete say over our lives

00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:21.900
through our finances it's not a very far leap from okay

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.860
I get a little stipend we share all our finances except for my little stipend

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.520
two where did your money go

00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:30.840
you should have this much left

00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:32.080
what did you spend that on

00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:35.240
why did you buy that experience in an abusive relationship

00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:41.580
I was tormented for wanting to spend $5 on a pair of denim shorts

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.480
while my boyfriend at the time

00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:48.740
sat there in the cafe where the second hand shorts were on sale

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.980
and was drinking two five dollar beverages

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.160
it's not really about the money

00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:56.720
it's about the control five dollar shorts

00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:01.420
I did not buy new clothes myself for over a year in that relationship

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.240
because even though he didn't have oversight into my actual accounts

00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:09.520
he was still tryna control my spending

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.640
he did this in numerous way

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:14.520
I was never a big shopper and when we broke up

00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:18.920
I went and spent $500 um at H&M that it just opened

00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:22.440
um yeah fast fashion but anyway

00:03:22.441 --> 00:03:25.860
I was just I felt like I've been released from financial prison

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.560
and ever since then I found that like

00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:32.560
buying clothes and things for myself is almost this like

00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:34.920
symbol of freedom for me um

00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:37.240
freedom from those in trappings

00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:41.360
do not take this advice my mother taught me a couple things and she always said

00:03:41.361 --> 00:03:42.654
keep your own bank account
