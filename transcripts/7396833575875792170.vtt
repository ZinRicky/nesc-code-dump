00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.720
dad do you have anything to say to people that stole your nectarines

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:03.960
okay I forgive you

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:05.320
okay that's it

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:06.840
what can I do oh wait

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:07.640
that's sweet

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.340
he wanted to show you guys

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.960
this is what the nectarines looked like

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:13.420
do you see how full that was

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.500
he was so proud 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.580
look at that they stole all of that

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.120
all of that and more and more it’s a big tree

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:25.260
yeah sucks

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.460
those pictures were from July 28th

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.560
and today is what last year

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:32.460
and today is probably the 27th (today is in fact the 28th,,,)

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.660
oh that's so sad

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.060
he was so proud

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.300
whoever stole my dad's nectarines

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.560
you better watch out (it’s okay) you better watch out

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:44.660
it's not okay

00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:47.136

00:00:47.137 --> 00:00:50.564
