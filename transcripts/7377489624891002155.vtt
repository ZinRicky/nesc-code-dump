00:00.080 --> 00:02.080
My husband doesn't eat cake,

00:02.081 --> 00:03.801
but it is his birthday in the morning

00:03.802 --> 00:06.121
and he requested his mom's chocolate cake.

00:06.122 --> 00:08.981
So when everyone went to bed, I started baking.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.480
I combined some water and butter in a pot

00:11.481 --> 00:15.441
and let that boil on the stove before whisking in some cocoa powder.

00:15.442 --> 00:17.721
I poured that into my dry ingredients,

00:17.722 --> 00:18.761
cracked an egg in it,

00:18.762 --> 00:22.281
added some sour cream, and beat that on a low speed.

00:22.282 --> 00:23.521
When it all came together,

00:23.522 --> 00:25.161
I poured it into my sheet pan

00:25.162 --> 00:27.601
and popped it in the oven for about 20 minutes.

00:27.602 --> 00:28.561
While that's baking,

00:28.562 --> 00:32.621
I clean up my workstation before moving on to making my frosting.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.080
Frosting is very simple.

00:34.081 --> 00:35.281
Add some cocoa powder,

00:35.282 --> 00:39.281
sour cream, and some milk before I sift in some powdered sugar,

00:39.282 --> 00:42.321
mix that until smooth and spread it all over my cake.

00:42.322 --> 00:44.801
My husband doesn't really like celebrating his birthday,

00:44.802 --> 00:47.561
but I decided to make it just a tad more special

00:47.562 --> 00:49.421
by putting up some decorations.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.520
I decided on a golden black theme for his birthday birthday,

00:52.521 --> 00:55.281
so I got some balloons that would match that

00:55.282 --> 00:57.681
and put them up on top of our stove

00:57.682 --> 00:59.421
and also on the ceiling.

00:59.480 --> 01:03.160
I got this birthday banner and thought it would be a lot bigger,

01:03.161 --> 01:04.441
but nevertheless

01:04.442 --> 01:07.961
I put it up and sprinkled some of these Golden Star

01:07.962 --> 01:11.841
confetti on in the kitchen counter before packing his little gift bag.

01:11.842 --> 01:13.881
Lucky! And I don't do surprises that well,

01:13.882 --> 01:16.961
so I already got Him his birthday presents a while ago.

01:16.962 --> 01:18.841
So this wasn't the big present.

01:18.842 --> 01:22.761
Then I unpacked all of my candles and prepped them for the morning

01:22.762 --> 01:26.501
before I wrapped up my cake and finally went to bed.
