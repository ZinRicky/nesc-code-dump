00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.480
Here's everything I make in an afternoon

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:05.081
as a mom who was just traveling for the past three weeks

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:07.321
and needs to get back into her healthy routine.

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:10.001
Part 2. After straining my chicken bone broth,

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:12.401
I threw together a wild salmon salad for lunch

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.041
using ingredients in my pantry.

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:15.801
You'll never find tuna in my pantry

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:18.601
because it's high in mercury and something I try to avoid.

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:20.081
I whipped up a homemade Mayo yogurt

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:22.561
using two orange yolks for my backyard chickens,

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:24.321
extra virgin olive oil, Dijon,

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:27.101
half a lemon for my tree, and mineral rich sea salt.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.200
Mayo is a super food when you make it yourself

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:32.061
rather than the store bought trash that's got seed oils.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.000
I still have some pickled green peaches from last year's harvest,

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.281
so I added these in. When the broth was chilled,

00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:39.121
I scooped off the nutrient dense fat

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.041
and stored that for later cooking uses.

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:44.321
I remove the fat from my broth so that we don't overdose on it.

00:00:44.322 --> 00:00:46.641
I like to know how much fat I'm adding into a meal

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:48.521
and this is the best way to do it.

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:50.401
When it was time to get dinner started,

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:52.681
I harvested some zucchini from my garden

00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:56.801
and then created a casserole by adding shredded chicken, quinoa,

00:00:56.802 --> 00:00:58.601
gelatinous broth, tomato sauce,

00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:00.501
and raw cheese to a Dutch oven.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.720
This is a really easy meal to throw together for a family

00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:06.021
as it doesn't require much skill or thought.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.360
Dinner baked for over an Hour when the keto was set.

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:10.841
Next time I'll give myself a little more time for the bake.

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:12.881
But I started a bit late. Before bed,

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:14.161
I fed my sourdough starter

00:01:14.162 --> 00:01:16.101
so it would be ready to bake bread in the morning.
