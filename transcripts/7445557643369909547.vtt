00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.480
So I've been doing a little bit of kitchen supply shopping recently.

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:05.441
On one of my trips back home to England,

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:08.361
I stayed in this beautiful Airbnb in the English countryside.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:09.801
It had one of those big old

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:14.061
traditional cast iron stoves and a cabinet full of Mason Cash bowls.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.920
This took me right back to being a kid.

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:17.681
My aunt, my grandmother's,

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:20.601
they all had Mason Cash bowls in their kitchen when I was growing up,

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:22.761
and I miss them so badly.

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:25.361
Didn't wanna buy any while in England and bring them back

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:28.341
because I already got a bunch of other stuff that I was bringing back.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.720
So I went searching online

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:32.681
and I found that Everything's Kitchen sells everything.

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:37.041
I love Mason Cash. My favourite bowl is this huge Mason Cash bowl.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:38.641
This is the biggest one they sell,

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.641
and it's perfect for making sourdough bread.

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:43.181
I love to make my sourdough bread in batches.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.840
So here I'm making three loaves.

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:47.401
I'm gonna make bake one straight away and put the rest in the fridge.

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:50.441
This is my absolute favorite way to make sourdough bread.

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:52.361
So I don't feel like I'm constantly making bread.

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:53.681
I just have one prep day,

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:55.821
and then we have three loaves throughout the week

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.400
for cooking for dinner. This is the perfect Christmas gift

00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:00.659
for anyone who loves vintage kitchen items.
