00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
Please tell me I'm not the only mom who,

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:05.721
at the end of the night, goes onto Google and starts researching, like,

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:07.261
mom topics.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.040
And sometimes the goal is just to relieve yourself of the guilt. Like,

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:12.441
oh, my god,

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:14.081
am I the worst mom ever in the whole world?

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:15.201
And so you're trying to find other people

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:16.881
that have been in a similar situation,

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.361
or you're trying to find research studies.

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:19.641
You're just trying to, like,

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:20.961
make yourself feel better.

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.441
In some ways, sometimes you just end up making yourself worse.

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:26.741
But are you with me so far?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.360
One of those nights I went on that little search,

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:34.061
and the rabbit hole I went down brought me to the Stanford University,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.360
and they published an article that said

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:40.761
the teen brain tunes in less to Mom's voice,

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:42.201
more to unfamiliar voices.

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:45.501
And this is what LED me to get a divorce.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.920
This Stanford study. When I read this,

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:49.101
I was like,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.300
if I continue to focus on what type of wife I am

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.020
and prioritize my marriage over motherhood,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.560
maybe when they grow up, I'm not even gonna have the opportunity

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.521
to have a relationship with them.

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:04.841
Maybe by the time they grow up,

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:08.521
it's too late. The article says around age 13,

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:11.661
kids brains shift from focusing on their mother's voices

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.200
to favor new voices. Part of the biological signal

00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:17.641
driving teens to separate from their parents.

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:18.921
So it's basically saying, like,

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:21.361
right around the age 13, when Your kids are, like,

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:22.321
entering high school,

00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:25.301
and all these new voices and people are gonna come into their life.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340
That's also when their brain is starting to tune out. Their parents,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.240
um, they literally did brain scans

00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:37.001
and published the information in the journal of neuroscience.

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.321
So this isn't some, you know,

00:01:39.322 --> 00:01:42.781
bunk bullshit. This is real scientific data.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.640
Just as an infant knows to tune into her mother's voice

00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:48.301
and adolescent knows to turn into novel voices

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.800
as a teen, you don't know you're doing this.

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:52.221
You're just being you.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.880
It goes on to say that in teenage brains,

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.041
the reward circuits

00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:59.601
and the brain centers that prioritize important stimuli

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:02.541
are more activated by unfamiliar voices

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.080
than by those of their mothers.

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:08.781
The brains shift toward new voices is an aspect of healthy maturation.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.920
So it is a good thing. But if you think about it,

00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:14.481
you really only have your kids childhood.

00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:17.081
So if you spend their whole childhood, um,

00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:20.501
like, working on your marriage and focusing on trying to make it work,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.360
you're giving up their whole childhood to some person.

00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:26.481
And then to end up still getting divorced, like,

00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:28.501
oh, we're just gonna stay together for the kids.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.960
I was like, oh,

00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:32.621
hell no. You know,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.240
and maybe that's why some people

00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:36.281
end up having such a hard time with their teenagers

00:02:36.282 --> 00:02:37.341
is because

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.360
in the little bit of time that you had to speak into their life,

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:42.361
you were too busy focused on that

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:45.761
Bullshit ass marriage that wasn't making you happy anyway,

00:02:45.762 --> 00:02:47.201
and you ended up divorced anyway.

00:02:47.202 --> 00:02:49.161
I rather end if I was gonna end up divorced anyway,

00:02:49.162 --> 00:02:53.401
I rather end up divorced and with the ability to still have, like,

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:55.501
some relationship with my kids.
