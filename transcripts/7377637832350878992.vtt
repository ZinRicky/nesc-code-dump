00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.376
if you've been waiting for a kitchen reveal 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:03.369
this isn't it 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.840
I'm sorry

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:06.160
but I do owe you a kitchen update and I need your help

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:07.280
so stick around till the end

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:10.180
so this is where we started before we started pulling it apart

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.320
if you want the full back story

00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:13.520
I'll link the video in the caption below but essentially

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:15.421
we're just giving this kitchen a wee facelift

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:16.520
 the old bench got removed

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:18.800
which I think my American friends called countertops?

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:20.880
whatever you call them we didn't have them for two weeks

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:22.120
which was a bit of a punish

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:23.472
but two weeks came and went and 

00:00:23.473 --> 00:00:25.120
In and went the new stone and the new sink

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:27.234
which if you know me you know I'm very excited about

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:27.560
In went the tap

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:30.160
and I spent a good amount of time playing with my new hose

00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:31.320
hubby cut some drywall

00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:34.840
which we call GIB ready for the new tile and as of this moment right now

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:35.712
this is where we're at 

00:00:35.713 --> 00:00:37.116
I need to paint literally everything 

00:00:37.117 --> 00:00:37.800
including the door

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:41.040
which I painted the wrong shade of green ages ago and just never corrected

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.400
and I mentioned in the previous video

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.440
I was gonna show you how the sensor works on the new tap

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:45.977
so there you go this is how it works 

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:47.640
I think it's pretty bloody cool actually

00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:49.560
I'm gonna put some cute brass handles everywhere

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.800
and obviously we need to tile 

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.000
and this is where you come in

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:53.600
I've narrowed it down to 3 options

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:54.880
but I keep changing my mind

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:57.520
cause a big part of me really does a clean white on white kitchen

00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:58.920
but then colour is so fun

00:00:58.921 --> 00:00:59.554
but also scary 

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:01.120
so I don't know, what would you choose?

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.000
and I will give you the full rundown on the stone

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.574
but that deserves its own video
