I have a mom hack that will change your life literally

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:04.320
hi I'm Chelsea

00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:05.800
a 31 year old homeschool mom

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:07.200
and if you're anything like me

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:09.640
you prepare a lot of snacks and meals for your kids

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:10.840
our day starts with breakfast

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:13.560
then second breakfast and then a snack lunch

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.360
five more snacks dinner

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.480
another snack and then a bedtime snack

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:19.400
does that sound familiar if so

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:21.080
you need to start making snack boards

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:23.680
it's basically a charcuterie board filled with fruits

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.440
veggies and your kid's favourite snacks

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.880
you serve it at lunch and let it sit on the counter until dinner

00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:30.880
instead of asking for snacks right after lunch or while you're cooking

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:33.580
they can help themselves to whatever is left on the snackboard

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.600
since I started doing these

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.480
my kids no longer ask me for snacks

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:38.640
and they have increased the amount of fruits and veggies they eat

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.840
throughout the day it is a win win in my book

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:43.640
I switch up what I put on the board each day so they don't get bored of it

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:45.680
and I let them pick out what they want from the grocery store

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:46.920
so they're guaranteed to eat it

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.662
there's also a great way to cut back on food waste
