00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.920
So I absolutely love this comment

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:02.321
because

00:00:02.322 --> 00:00:05.201
she touches on something that most people don't even talk about

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:09.221
or even realize. Everything in our world is about men.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.400
Hear me out. What she's referring to is every clinical study that has,

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:15.881
like, ever been done for health,

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:18.121
for fitness, for beauty,

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:20.641
for Big Pharma, for anything,

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:24.281
even economical status, economical fairness.

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:28.401
All those studies have always been performed on men.

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.601
Doctor Mindy Pell talks about this. Um,

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:33.161
and I think it's genius to figure out why.

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:37.741
The reason for this is because men provide cheap data.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.540
What do I mean by cheap data?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.680
A man's biological cycle runs in 24 hours.

00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:45.361
The easiest way to understand this,

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:47.921
and most applicable, is when a man wakes up,

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:50.401
his testosterone is at its highest peak.

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:53.441
That would explain what happens to them in the morning.

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:58.521
Whereas a woman cycle is literally 28 to 30 days long.

00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:01.441
So you cannot perform clinical tests,

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:05.161
especially regarding maybe like fitness and weightlifting,

00:01:05.162 --> 00:01:06.801
on a group of women

00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:10.681
unless they're all in the exact same stage of their cycle. Why?

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:15.081
Well, a woman should not be working out in the first week of her cycle

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:18.761
the same way she would work out and say the last week of her cycle.

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:21.161
But to perform that study on a man is easy

00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:24.061
because they all are on 24 hour cycles.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.320
Men are so much less complicated than women.

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.001
And I this is not an insult,

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:30.601
but mentally, emotionally,

00:01:30.602 --> 00:01:35.401
Physically, they are so much less complicated than the female body

00:01:35.402 --> 00:01:38.181
and the female mind and the female emotions.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.800
So they allow for cheap, cheap data.

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:46.121
To perform those exact same studies on a group of women

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:48.661
would take so much more work,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.440
so much more money, and honestly,

00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:55.541
so much more knowledge that most industries don't even have.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.320
That is why we are not the same.

00:01:57.321 --> 00:02:00.001
We are not equal. Equal opportunity. Yes,

00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:04.961
but women are not men. But what I love are people like Doctor Mindy Pal

00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:07.601
who wrote books fast like a girl,

00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:11.321
because they are taking knowledge

00:02:11.322 --> 00:02:14.921
that was previously only performed on men,

00:02:14.922 --> 00:02:19.141
and they're now changing and evolving it to fit women.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.900
Not enough research has been done on women.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.360
The bio hacking industry is huge right now.

00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:27.201
I started a bio hacking page on Instagram,

00:02:27.202 --> 00:02:29.521
but it's all based on men.

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:32.561
Dave Asbury, David Brecca or Bercca,

00:02:32.562 --> 00:02:39.381
I don't know his name, but all of these bio hackers are really all men.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.180
They don't have any clue how biohacking would work for a woman.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.640
And just to do all the biohacking that was done on that guy who, like,

00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:52.861
took his kids plasma, I can't remember his name.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.020
Brian Johnson. I just looked it up.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.040
Apparently he is like the most studied man in the entire world.

00:02:58.041 --> 00:02:59.361
And they've already spent like

00:02:59.362 --> 00:03:04.161
$4.5 million on testing every aspect of his body and his cycle

00:03:04.162 --> 00:03:07.821
and his circadian rhythm and his erections and everything.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.380
But To do that for a woman,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.760
that would probably take $15 million.

00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:15.441
So I'm excited to see the future

00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:18.241
where more studies are done and performed on women

00:03:18.242 --> 00:03:18.801
by women

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:22.201
and see where that leads us in these industries like Big Pharma,

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.221
fitness, health, everything.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.362
Yeah, that's a very good point. Tell me your thoughts.
