00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
If you're in a healthy relationship with a man,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.880
can you stitch this video and talk about it?

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.320
Any chance I get to brag on my husband,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.960
I have to take it.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.960
So if you are struggling, um,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.000
in the dating arena,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.560
I just wanna tell you that there is good men

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.240
still out there.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.360
They do exist.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.360
I met my husband through mutual friends of ours,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.080
and since the day I met him,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.620
we've been completely inseparable.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.000
And I've never really felt that way about anyone else.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.600
Let me tell you,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.220
I have kissed many frogs to get to my prince. Okay, I.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.120
Manchilds, okay?

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.800
They are not.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.560
They're not even worthy to be called men,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.380
half of them.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.660
And so, ah, ha, ha.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.440
Meeting my husband,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.060
he was different

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.920
than any of the guys that I've previously been with.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.720
My husband is very soft spoken.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.040
He is very kind.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.800
He is very selfless.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.440
The amount of miles my husband goes for just me,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.320
not even our daughter,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.200
just for me.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.000
That is speaks volumes of his character.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.380
This man still gives me butterflies.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.120
He still gives me butterflies to this day.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.600
Like, anytime he's telling me he's coming home,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.800
I get butterflies

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.760
because I am just so excited to see him.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.880
One time, um,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.880
through my entire marriage,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.800
that has really stuck with me

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.720
was how he treated me postpartum.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.320
Now, if you ever been pregnant,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.000
you've had a baby,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.320
you know how vulnerable postpartum is.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.680
I had Severe postpartum anxiety,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.840
like, really bad.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.400
And then I had a little bit,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460
I think, of postpartum depression.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.880
Um, but my husband,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.360
man, he was my absolute rock through that.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.280
You know, I would wake up

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.940
breastfeeding my child in the middle of the night,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.260
he would wake up, too,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.600
and there's nothing he can do.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.840
He. He could sleep.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.080
You know, he should sleep,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.580
honestly, with the line of his work.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.040
Um, but he would just sit there and rub my back

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.360
and tell me I'm doing a good job,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.540
that I'm a good mom.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.200
When I was nursing, he would.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200
I wasn't able to, like,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.300
eat with my hands.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.660
He sat there and fed me some stew out of a bowl,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.920
and I just. I don't know.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.680
It's just little,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.580
small acts like that are just huge.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.180
He is so patient with me, okay,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.400
that. That alone is Equality,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.620
because I can drive my spouse nuts,

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.880
but he is so patient with me.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.820
He's so gentle with me.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.560
Um, he's never harsh.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.560
He never speaks harshly to me,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.400
and if he does,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.960
he's very quick to apologize.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.760
It's very rare occasion that he's

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.380
ever said anything harsh to me.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.360
The thing I love most about our marriage

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.480
is the ability that we have to laugh together,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.640
which I swear

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.800
is the key to marriage.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.360
If you cannot laugh about a really bad situation,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.620
um, together,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.560
I. I don't know. It's.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.600
Laughter is the best medicine in marriage.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.800
That Is my opinion on that.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.200
I truly can say that he is my best friend.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.320
And there is good men out there.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.520
Do not get discouraged.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.760
There is good men out there.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.260
I promise you.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.360
Um, look in your local churches,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.460
because that's where a lot of them are.
