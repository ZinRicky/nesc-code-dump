00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.880
How about we stop romanticizing everything

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:08.461
because we don't live in the motherfucking notebook, you know?

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.240
I know that every girl is just imagining that scene against the car,

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:17.761
like. And I'm gonna choose you,

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:19.161
and it's gonna be hard,

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:22.961
but I'm gonna choose you every day because I love you.

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:23.481
Like, oh,

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.441
my god, it's a fucking movie.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.661
Just like we don't want men to look at corn

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.520
and assume that that's what that is supposed to be like in real life.

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.521
Women need to stop romanticizing everything

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:38.921
and thinking everything is gonna be magical and beautiful.

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:41.641
Come the fuck on. Come the fuck on.

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:45.641
Be so fucking for real. Do we tell our sons that?

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:46.441
You know what, buddy?

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:50.641
When you grow up, you don't have to worry about figuring shit out

00:00:50.642 --> 00:00:54.201
or knowing how to financially pay for yourself in any capacity.

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:56.701
Just find a friend that you can live with and support

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.480
and just making arrangement with them,

00:00:58.481 --> 00:01:01.441
because that's. That's a totally fine option in life.

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:03.201
No, we don't do that.

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:08.361
We don't set our sons up for that type of dependency on someone else.

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:10.441
We teach them to be independent and grown and.

00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:12.261
But we're gonna tell our daughters,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.360
just go be a baby making machine.

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:18.481
Just go ahead and use that vagina so that when you're done,

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:20.561
people will call you, run through,

00:01:20.562 --> 00:01:23.101
and you have no other option.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.440
No, that's. No.

00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:28.161
And if we go back to the video,

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:32.281
I'm not attacking Her. I start the video out by saying, tribewives,

00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:35.561
you need to understand that your husbands are kind of fucking weird.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:38.861
The reason why that article with Ballerina Farm went south

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.000
was cause her fucking husband got involved.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.561
And because you could see the realities of her life.

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:46.281
How drowning in children she is,

00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:49.021
how much the children, small children,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.980
are tasked with caring for each other.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.640
And the journalist was simply stating these things,

00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:58.121
facts that they saw, facts that are realities in any home

00:01:58.122 --> 00:02:00.721
where there are nine children and not much fucking help

00:02:00.722 --> 00:02:04.701
and moms busy cooking every goddamn aspect of everything by scratch.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.660
So I'm not attacking her.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.760
Women need to fucking get off your high fucking horse.

00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:12.761
Realize that like someone,

00:02:12.762 --> 00:02:14.721
there's no. There's no jealousy,

00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:15.601
no animosity.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.481
Sometimes another woman is truly just trying to look out for you

00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:19.201
and be like, hey,

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:22.221
maybe there are some drawbacks to that lifestyle.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.760
Maybe other people can see that your husband's kind of weird

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:26.901
and controlling.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.520
I wasn't attacking her. I'm not even attacking her husband.

00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:34.041
I'm just saying like, hey, guys,

00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:37.621
just so you know, I'm not saying this with any.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.720
Anything in my heart other than love and concern,

00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:45.821
because I was a tribe wife for 10 years.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.080
I did all that shit. I maybe wasn't on a 300 acre farm,

00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:52.481
but I like, gardened in the little spots that I could

00:02:52.482 --> 00:02:54.901
and did everything that I could of the lifestyle.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.940
And I gotta Tell ya, it's not all that it's made out to be.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.940
And the aftermath for your life is pretty fucking ugly.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.420
So watch the fuck out.
