00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
JD Vance just came out and said

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.801
one of the reasons people aren't having kids as much as they used to

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:05.941
is because of car seat regulation.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.040
That is the craziest, most delusional thing I've ever heard in my life.

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.961
I've never had a conversation with one of my friends

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:12.161
who was on the fence about having kids

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:13.121
and been like, yeah,

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:14.641
you know, there's a lot of pros to having kids,

00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:17.881
but the car seats. Like,

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:21.081
it's not funny, because he's completely missing any of,

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:23.441
like, the top reasons why the birth rate is declining

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:25.001
in order to, I don't know,

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.241
have a ridiculous sound bite.

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:27.681
This has to be on purpose

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.361
at this point, I can think of, like,

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.281
10 solid reasons just off the top of my head

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:32.941
of why the birth rate is declining.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.120
Not anywhere in the top 10 nor top 50.

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.121
Is car seat regulation gonna be in there.

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:38.681
Yeah, we're just.

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:40.481
We're just making these kids too safe.

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:42.641
It's a pain in the ass. Nobody wants to do that.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.721
I miss the good old days

00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:45.681
when we used to strap them in the back of the car

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:46.801
with a cigarette in their mouth

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:48.001
and call it a day. You know,

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:49.801
the fucked up thing is they probably actually believe that.

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:51.121
Uh, helmets and car seats.

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:53.161
What a fucking riot. I miss the good old days

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:54.201
when you used to be able to beat your wife

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:55.641
and hang her kid out the window, like,

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:58.641
This would be funny if this was an SNL skit,

00:00:58.642 --> 00:00:59.041
but, like,

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:00.201
the fact that this is

00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:02.781
someone who wants to be the vice president of the United States,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.880
it's shocking and horrifying.

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:07.138
Way to avoid the issues at all costs.
