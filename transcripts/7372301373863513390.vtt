00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.040
It's super easy to clean the inside of the boiler.

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:05.461
You just lift it up.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.080
Then I'm gonna take the pan that I had the bacon on,

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.121
and this is. The bacon grease is all settled in here,

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:16.541
so I'm gonna clean this out.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.980
Inside here is all enamel,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.340
so you just wipe this out with a rag.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.480
And then there's a little grease patch here,

00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:26.781
which I cooked some fried potatoes last night,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.020
so some of them fell down inside here.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.200
So you can cook here in the bottom of the grill

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:33.401
and then on top of the broiler at the same time

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:34.661
on this hot plate.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.220
The top of the umbrella also comes off to clean it.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.120
But the more you clean it,

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:42.781
the less, um,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.920
nonstick it is.

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:47.561
So I do. This is not as clean as I like it to look,

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:50.641
but the more seasoning builds up,

00:00:50.642 --> 00:00:51.921
the less things stick to it.

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:53.761
So I can fry some eggs on here just fine right now,

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:57.461
because it does have a little bit of build up of seasoning,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.120
but it has been,

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:00.555
you know, scrub down with soapy water.
