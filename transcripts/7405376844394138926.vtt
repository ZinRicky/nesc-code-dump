00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.280
This app isn't what it used to be.

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:06.621
And I know I'm not the only one who feels this way,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.640
but some of y'all don't care.

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.961
And I think everybody is so frustrated

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:13.481
and angry with the state of the world,

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:15.921
justifiably so, um,

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:19.921
that we have turned this place that was a digital third space

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:24.441
a social media community, and has made it one of the most, like,

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:28.561
toxic places since, I don't know, 2016.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:34.561
Instagram. The way people will just be outspokenly heinous to people

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:37.041
for the smallest thing. Like,

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:40.781
I have seen some of my mutuals who literally just post their, like,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.180
day to day life

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.840
being given death threats because they're so cringe or so annoying.

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:50.401
Like, who the fuck raised you to think that that's okay to say?

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:52.841
Somebody. Or what's happened to Chris Olsen,

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:54.401
which basically, he was, like,

00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:56.841
shot up to stardom on this app.

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:59.121
His entire livelihood and, like,

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:01.241
life is based on this app.

00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:01.881
And now

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:07.421
we are watching everything about his life be completely destroyed

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.440
because, I don't know,

00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:11.821
people got bored of him. They got oversaturated.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.760
Elise Myers,

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:16.281
who is arguably one of the most positive forces for good on this app,

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:17.561
getting bullied off the app

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:19.161
because she wouldn't open up her mouth

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:22.961
and talk about a topic you wanted her to talk about and listen.

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:25.681
I get it. It came from a good place.

00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:29.001
I am in complete support of the Palestinian cause

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:30.601
and have posted about It on my page,

00:01:30.602 --> 00:01:33.961
but my page. I have always spoken about controversial issues.

00:01:33.962 --> 00:01:38.201
Elise hasn't. And maybe that's not a good enough excuse for you

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:39.841
to justify her not speaking out.

00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:42.281
But you know what you do? You unfollow,

00:01:42.282 --> 00:01:46.001
you block. You tell people that you don't appreciate her stance.

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:46.481
You talk.

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:48.761
You don't tell her that she doesn't deserve to have her children

00:01:48.762 --> 00:01:50.481
and that she should go on a life herself.

00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:52.301
That's fucking unhinged.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800
There's so many people that are scared to even start making content

00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:57.341
because some of y'all are just so fucking mean.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.200
And I don't know,

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.221
I remember when this place was, like,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.360
a really wonderful community for people during COVID,

00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:05.081
when we didn't have places to, like,

00:02:05.082 --> 00:02:07.021
congregate, to have conversations,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.640
to hang out with other people.

00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:10.881
This was that place. At least it was for me.

00:02:10.882 --> 00:02:14.901
Like, good creativity is not going to exist under these conditions,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.840
because people aren't gonna put themselves out there to be torn apart

00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:18.881
for the sound of their voice,

00:02:18.882 --> 00:02:20.881
their appearance. God forbid they, like,

00:02:20.882 --> 00:02:23.961
try to do something that they aren't fucking perfect at on this app.

00:02:23.962 --> 00:02:24.921
God forbid they, like,

00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:26.441
ask advice about something

00:02:26.442 --> 00:02:28.601
and get told that they look like fucking shit

00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:30.521
and should just not even try.

00:02:30.522 --> 00:02:31.681
There's always been trolls,

00:02:31.682 --> 00:02:35.641
and I get that, but it's insanely worse than it used to be,

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:37.741
and it's just. It's really sad.
