What is the chokehold that blonde has on some of you guys?

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:05.041
And I'm not. Oh my god.

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:07.321
I've been wanting to make a video about this for a long time.

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:08.881
I'm starting to see this topic pop up.

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:10.841
I actually used to make a couple videos about this.

00:00:10.842 --> 00:00:12.741
But we need to talk about the idea.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.060
Blondeness as it pertains to the white beauty standard.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Right now my hair is like,

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.961
all burned. But I've been blonde before,

00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:20.361
I've been brown, I've been black,

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:22.321
I've been all the hair colors.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:25.001
But blonde is so much more than a hair color.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.121
Within the white beauty standard,

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:30.281
blonde is by far the superior hair color

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:32.001
because it appeals most to the male gaze.

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:34.641
Most men will actually tell you that they prefer long

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:35.841
blonde hair on a woman.

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:38.081
And this kind of speaks to our obsession with youth,

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:40.301
especially, in my opinion,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.040
the like, pedophilic nature of the male gaze.

00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:44.521
So when you look at the white beauty standard,

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:45.801
you look at, like, thin,

00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:48.741
you look at hairless, you look at blonde.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.360
Those are children. Having blonde hair

00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:55.221
as an adult woman puts you closer to the concept of youth,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.780
and youth puts you closer to desirability.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.120
Let that sink in for a second.

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:04.761
That's also why the same thing is equal,

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:07.681
yet opposite for the white beauty standard for men.

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:11.841
Blonde men are not as attractive as the tall,

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:15.381
dark, handsome archetype because most adults aren't blonde

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.380
and women are Not attracted to children in the same way that men are.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.437
You're welcome. That's gonna fuck you up for a while.
