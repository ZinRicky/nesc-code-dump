Mango sticky rice is all I can think about,

00:02.800 --> 00:05.600
and after ordering it and getting the tiniest portion,

00:05.600 --> 00:07.860
I just decided to make it myself.

00:08.080 --> 00:10.480
We buy a lot of mangoes when they're in season,

00:10.480 --> 00:13.600
so I started off by making some mango ice cream.

00:13.600 --> 00:14.960
I diced up my mango,

00:14.960 --> 00:18.540
added them to a blender with some sweetener and lemon,

00:18.880 --> 00:19.920
give that a good blend,

00:19.920 --> 00:21.840
then combine some heavy cream,

00:21.840 --> 00:23.380
milk, and some sugar.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.720
Added my mango puree,

00:24.720 --> 00:26.120
and let that chill in the fridge

00:26.120 --> 00:29.580
before transferring it over to my ice cream Turner.

00:29.640 --> 00:32.080
I turned it for about 20 to 30 minutes

00:32.080 --> 00:34.480
until it reached a soft serve consistency,

00:34.480 --> 00:36.040
and then I pop that in the freezer

00:36.040 --> 00:38.340
while I got started on my sticky rice.

00:38.520 --> 00:42.440
I had the rice soaking the night before and added it to my steamer.

00:42.440 --> 00:45.360
I let that steam while I started on my coconut sauce

00:45.360 --> 00:46.920
that was gonna go in with the rice,

00:46.920 --> 00:50.600
which was coconut milk and some sweetener and a pinch of salt.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.280
Once my rice was finished steaming,

00:52.280 --> 00:53.960
I added my coconut milk to it,

00:53.960 --> 00:56.620
covered it, and just let it sit while I made

00:56.840 --> 00:59.660
thicker coconut sauce to go on top of the rice.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.560
I let that reduce on the stove

01:01.560 --> 01:04.320
while I finished up prepping all of my other things,

01:04.320 --> 01:06.240
which was slicing some mango,

01:06.240 --> 01:09.680
and by this time, my rice had soaked up all of that coconut milk,

01:09.680 --> 01:11.520
so it was time to plate.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.840
I put down my Rice,

01:12.840 --> 01:13.880
added my mango,

01:13.880 --> 01:17.640
added some of that coconut cream on top with some sesame seeds,

01:17.640 --> 01:20.720
and then obviously had to pull out my mango ice cream.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.560
The cold ice cream went perfectly with the warm rice.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.780
This was absolutely divine.
