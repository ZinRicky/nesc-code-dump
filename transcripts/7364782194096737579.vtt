00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.820
This is the moment Palumi Nubi arrived in the Nigerian city of Lagos

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.680
back in January.

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.121
She embarked on a journey

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:27.041
that would establish her as the first black woman

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:28.881
to complete a solo road trip

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:30.621
from London to Lagos.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.720
So just important for me to do this and to inspire all the black women,

00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:37.241
all the travellers that they can step out their comfort zone too.

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:39.841
We are in France, guys,

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:41.761
we made it! Ha ha ha!

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:46.781
The travel content creator drove her small Peugeot across 17 countries,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.620
raising awareness about travel within the black community.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.780
Yeah!

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.620
In this car,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.720
newbie says she wanted to promote a safe and borderless Africa

00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:59.981
and challenge common misconceptions about the continent.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.660
But her journey was not without obstacles.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.900
She says she faced some challenges at border crossings,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.100
including a two day wait to enter Liberia.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.920
She argues that a more accessible Africa,

00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:15.025
similar to Europe's open borders.
