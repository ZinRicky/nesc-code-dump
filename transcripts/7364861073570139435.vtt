00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.280
Not only do I totally understand,

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.801
I 1,000,000% appreciate it,

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:05.741
because

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.840
I don't like hearing advice that just affirms what I already wanna do.

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:12.161
I definitely put myself out there for advice,

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:13.881
to hear opposing ideas,

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:14.881
what other people have to say,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.081
what other people have to feel,

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.401
you know, other people's opinions.

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:21.881
You know, I know that I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:22.741
You know,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.060
I know that I have four children,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.980
I pay child support,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.360
I don't have a ton of help.

00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:32.001
I don't in real life,

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.661
you know, like, day to day.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.360
And I've had a relationship with a person that I trust,

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:39.321
like, trust, trust.

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.581
Like, there have been enough moments to,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.960
you know, where I thought,

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:44.441
oh, boy, where's this gonna go?

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:46.241
And I'm always surprised at the outcome.

00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:50.241
So I feel as safe as possible doing this.

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:52.521
Obviously there is risk when you're moving in with a person,

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:53.481
when you have children,

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:54.481
when, I mean,

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:55.001
just anything.

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.601
There's risk associated with everything.

00:00:56.602 --> 00:01:00.921
And so I have thought of every possible thing that could go wrong.

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:03.281
Him and I have had as many open,

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:05.561
honest fucking conversations about everything. Money,

00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:07.501
what happens if one of us loses our job?

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.020
What happens? Blah, ABC.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.340
And so I think I.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.440
I mean, I understand all the risk and the concern,

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:20.261
because I would have the same for a friend.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.400
Um.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.880
And I appreciate it.

00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:24.881
I love it. I don't.

00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:25.801
You know, I don't.

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:27.201
I'm not Ever gonna be mad

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:30.741
that somebody cares enough to give me their honest opinion

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.240
when it may seem a little bit hard to do that?

00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:36.361
So I love you so much.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.041
Thank you. Thank you for the love,

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:40.041
the advice, the encouragement,

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:42.321
the support. I am listening.

00:01:42.322 --> 00:01:43.901
I don't want anybody to think I'm like,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.360
no, I'm listening.

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:46.881
And it is in my mind.

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:51.621
I do genuinely feel like this is the right direction.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.220
And I am open to wherever the universe leads or wherever my path leads.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.660
So I will keep you guys posted on the journey.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.960
He has given notice to his landlord.

00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:06.281
I gave notice to my landlord.

00:02:06.282 --> 00:02:10.061
I told my roommate I'm gonna start packing soon.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.800
So, you know,

00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:13.041
I don't know. I'll keep you posted.

00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:16.561
And I am very much open to hearing opposing opinions,

00:02:16.562 --> 00:02:19.081
and I very much value them and appreciate them,

00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.181
cause I know that can be hard. So thank you.
