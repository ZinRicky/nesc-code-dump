00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.960
men

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.700
not immigrants 

00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:04.080
are the problem

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:05.240
across time space

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:06.740
geography culture

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.560
men have consistently and overwhelmingly perpetuated violence against women

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:16.280
white American men also unalive women all the time

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:18.600
they are actually most consistently in this country

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:23.400
the mass unalivers and they do this to women because they're women

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:25.560
because they don't like how you looked at them

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:26.760
or you didn't look at them

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:30.680
or how you dressed or how you failed to acquiesce to their demands

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:33.600
or you didn't give them your attention or your time

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:36.280
do this to women because they're women

00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:37.934
it's a form of misogyny 

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:39.520
they are using violence

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:41.640
and just the general threat of violence

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:45.760
to ensure that they can try to maintain control over women

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:50.560
focusing that narrative on that this individual was an undocumented immigrant

00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:54.480
only fuels that misogyny because every time this stuff happens

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:56.080
whether it's mass on a living

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:57.800
or it's a situation like this

00:00:57.801 --> 00:01:00.260
we talk about everything else

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.520
except for the problem that is right in front of us

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:04.582
it's men 

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:10.960
we have a profound problem with violence against women

00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:13.680
that is specifically perpetuated by men

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:17.694
in order to address that we need to name it
