Tonight, our family is hunkering down

00:01.800 --> 00:04.260
to spend some cozy time together at home,

00:04.280 --> 00:07.280
and I am partnering with Albertsons to make something

00:07.280 --> 00:08.280
really yummy for dinner.

00:08.280 --> 00:11.140
Come with me to Albertsons to pick up everything I need.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.360
Albertsons drive up and go

00:12.360 --> 00:14.480
makes it so quick for me to get everything I need

00:14.480 --> 00:16.440
without having to get myself or my kiddos

00:16.440 --> 00:17.260
out of the car.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.320
I am home, I have all my ingredients,

00:19.320 --> 00:21.560
and I'm ready to make some yummy dip.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.120
My husband is a huge sports fan,

00:23.120 --> 00:24.880
so that's what's on the docket tonight,

00:24.880 --> 00:26.480
but he's also a huge food fan,

00:26.480 --> 00:29.360
and I love how this recipe tastes so fresh and homemade.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.940
When I use good ingredients,

00:30.960 --> 00:32.640
the fresh corn makes a huge difference,

00:32.640 --> 00:33.480
and Albertson says

00:33.480 --> 00:35.700
all of my go to fresh and pantry staples.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.040
Now everything is ready to go

00:38.040 --> 00:39.820
for our closing night at home together.
