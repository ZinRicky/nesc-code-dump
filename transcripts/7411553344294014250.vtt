00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.840
list of things that I think men should never do

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:05.000
starting off with number one-cooking

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.360
if you have a woman then I think that she should do it

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:09.911
okay personally, I leave that up to me 

00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:11.240
unless it's the grill

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:13.560
unless it's like a steak you got the meat

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.254
I'll do everything else 

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:17.121
number two-doing their laundry 

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:19.560
I know some of y'all are gonna come for me

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.080
but I just don't think men should have to

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:22.400
cause they're not good at it

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:23.720
they don't know how to fold 

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.680
they leave it in the dryer for too long

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.840
and then when they take it out

00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:28.240
it's all wrinkled just

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:29.520
just leave it up to us woman

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:30.091
okay 

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:31.920
No. three-decorating

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:32.760
so sorry

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.560
those neon signs gotta go

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.000
the flags with your sports thing

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:39.818
you know I think that us women

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:40.818
we have an eye for it leave it to us

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:43.238
No.4 buying groceries

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.809
or preparing or planning what we're gonna eat for the week

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.849
cause if you leave it to a man

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.909
they're probably gonna be cooking you beef

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.869
just beef.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.109
no sides no greens

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.065
just beef 

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.309
No. 5 dusting

00:00:55.324 --> 00:01:00.624
I don't think any man should ever be seen dusting with those little things

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:02.984
I just it doesn't sit right in my brain

00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:04.184
okay that

00:01:04.323 --> 00:01:05.563
no explanation needed there

00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:07.354
No. six mopping

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:09.734
I don't think I've ever seen a guy mop

00:01:09.818 --> 00:01:13.818
and for good reason I think men should be allowed to vacuum

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.298
but leave the mopping up to me

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.707
No. 7 putting laundry away 

00:01:18.708 --> 00:01:19.778
not sure why

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.858
but it's just not built into their brains

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:22.978
to know that

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.258
the dish towels and the bathroom towels are two very separate things

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.538
leave that up to the woman

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:30.321
okay 

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:34.106
I understand that all men should know how to do all these things 

00:01:34.107 --> 00:01:35.892
but I donâ€™t think they should have to do them
