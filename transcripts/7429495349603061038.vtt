00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
I live in North Carolina and in the past few weeks

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.681
I've seen the devastating impact

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:07.161
that Hurricane Helena's had on my friends,

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:08.981
my family, my communities.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.680
But something that I haven't seen enough people talking about

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:15.321
is the devastating impact this Hurricane has had on reproductive care

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:17.281
in my state. In Western North Carolina,

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:20.481
there is one abortion clinic, Ashville,

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.721
which is one of the cities that was hit the hardest

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:25.581
when Hurricane Helene swept through North Carolina.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.320
As of today, it is still non operative and non functioning

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:33.241
because of the impact the Hurricane had on Ashville's water supply.

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.921
70% of Ashville still without water

00:00:35.922 --> 00:00:39.441
including the clinic. Carolina has a restrictive 12 week ban.

00:00:39.442 --> 00:00:43.501
We are surrounded, especially on the western side of North Carolina,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.920
by states with even more restrictive or total abortion bans. Tennessee,

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:49.661
Georgia, South Carolina.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.040
Making this single plan parenthood in Asheville

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:53.681
that is now non functioning place

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:56.241
for many in those states with restrictive bans

00:00:56.242 --> 00:00:59.401
would come when they could not get care in their own home states.

00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:02.401
Facility being non operative also hurts the local community

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:06.241
because they now don't have access to free or low cost birth control,

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:07.721
emergency contraception.

00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:10.201
Things also prevent pregnancies in the first place.

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:13.441
The scope of damage to the natural disasters cause is vast.

00:01:13.442 --> 00:01:16.201
Couple with all these restrictive bands also in place

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:17.321
in these southern states

00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:19.801
where natural disasters tend to hit most often,

00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:22.301
they have devastated reproductive rights.
