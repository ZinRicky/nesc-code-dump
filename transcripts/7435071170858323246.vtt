00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.060
Children before the age of 8 cannot self regulate

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.320
without a co regulating caregiver.

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:11.221
And this is where attachment injury is born.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.400
When you hear that,

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:16.481
give your inner child a moment of self empathy and compassion

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:20.521
for the part that can easily come out of regulation.

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:23.241
Because it wasn't your fault.

00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:25.241
It simply wasn't your fault.

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:27.641
And it's not your parents fault either

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:31.521
cause they did not know. Who do you think is regulating your child?

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:33.201
They are in daycare or public school.

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:34.721
Who do you think is holding them,

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:37.761
breathing with them, trying to figure out how to regulate their emotion?

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:40.281
If you're wondering why your husband has such a bad temper

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:42.801
or why so many of your exes were completely avoidant

00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:45.301
or detached emotionally from your relationship

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.680
because they were handed off to daycare workers

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:49.321
and public school teachers

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:52.641
and they were not taught how to properly regulate their emotions,

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:56.281
which has had lasting repercussions on the rest of the relationships

00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:57.841
for the rest of their adult life.

00:00:57.842 --> 00:00:59.601
I agree with not blaming your parents

00:00:59.602 --> 00:01:01.521
because the truth is they didn't know back then.

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:02.801
My mother told me all the time

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:04.161
how the doctors told me

00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:06.241
that you guys could go in your own bed at 3 months

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:07.921
and I should let you cry it out.

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:12.201
I know people who would let their children scream for hours

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:14.801
without comforting them because they were told it was right,

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:16.781
either by a parent or a physician.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.240
But now we Have actual data on the Guinea pigs that were us.

00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:21.821
As millennials, our generation,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.520
we now know the trauma it causes.

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:26.001
And all the attachment disorders

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.441
that I've been discussing in my last 10 videos.

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:30.441
Everything I post, I say out of love,

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:32.641
because I don't want a mom to regret

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:35.201
possibly making the wrong decision with their children.

00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:37.321
These are decisions that we can't take back.

00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:41.241
And could cause potential trauma for the rest of your child's life.

00:01:41.242 --> 00:01:43.281
It is one thing to not know,

00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:45.721
but it is another thing to see the evidence,

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:47.321
read the science, read the books,

00:01:47.322 --> 00:01:49.481
listen to all these children psychologists

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:51.061
and development psychologists

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.380
discussing attachment disorders,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.720
and then to get mad and say that I'm shaming moms.

00:01:56.721 --> 00:01:58.481
I'm not trying to shame anyone.

00:01:58.482 --> 00:02:01.401
I am trying to make sure you don't get hurt as a mom,

00:02:01.402 --> 00:02:03.381
or blame yourself when you are older.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.820
Using to stay home with your child when they are born,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.960
and through the first two years of their development.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.681
It's not a choice to take lightly.

00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:12.761
It's not deciding whether you want a Big Mac or a whopper for that day.

00:02:12.762 --> 00:02:15.261
This is something that has lasting consequences.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.060
That we are now seeing in every aspect of life in our nation.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.040
Most importantly, should reveal how important your job is as a mother.

00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:25.301
It is sanctified, it is beautiful.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.568
It is the most important thing.
