00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.700
Are they lightweight enough?

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.860
You guys?

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.320
This waffle material from Halara is so lightweight.

00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:07.361
It's super easy, breezy.

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:09.821
It always fit very flowy and loose.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.080
There's pockets, so there's tons of space.

00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:14.641
It's never choking you in.

00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:16.761
I usually wear a size large,

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:19.961
but since I got the elastic bottom version this time,

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:22.361
I wanted them to be a little bit more athletic looking.

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:23.481
I wanted to be able to, like,

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.621
run around in the summertime with my kids.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.980
So I got a size small and they still fit amazing.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.760
I'd say the wide leg version definitely feels a little more elegant,

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:33.481
like you can go to work.

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:34.361
There's always a

00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:36.721
big time discount for first time uses of the TikTok Shop.

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:37.601
It's linked right here.

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:39.081
If you wanna get a pair of your own,

00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:40.721
don't worry about size or color

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:42.361
because there's free shipping and free return.

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:45.430
So just get what you like and see how it fits.
