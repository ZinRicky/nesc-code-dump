Hi, friends.

00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:02.681
I'm so excited to talk to you guys

00:00:02.682 --> 00:00:04.881
about something that I've been working on for a while now,

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:07.261
and that is a partnership with World Vision.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.700
World Vision is a Christian organization that focuses on poverty

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.500
and families all across the world that are in need.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.560
And after discussing some things with Jake

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.721
and looking over their website

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.921
and looking over everything that they stand for,

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:23.641
we ourselves

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:27.121
have decided that we are going to start giving monthly

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:31.201
to World Vision. World Vision is launching a new subscription plan

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:35.761
where you can donate monthly to them and actually see a difference

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:37.881
that the change that your money is making.

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:41.881
Instead of you subscribing to something and being promised a product,

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:43.701
if it's going to change your life,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.800
you will actually be making a difference

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.321
for people all around the world.

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:49.221
I'm really excited about this organization

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.800
because this is one way that you can really help those in need.

00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:57.461
