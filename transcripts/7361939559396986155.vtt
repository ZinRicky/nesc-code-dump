00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.120
Fridge for the milk,

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:02.581
and I'm gonna make some raw butter.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.840
But this butter is the best butter of the year

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:06.401
because it's spring grass butter.

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:09.801
That means it's the best tasting and best looking butter

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:10.901
you're gonna get all year.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.720
I'm gonna have to go for all this milk right now

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.261
just to make sure it's not sour.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.780
This might be sour because it's been sitting

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.060
in my fridge forever,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.060
but actually, I think it's good.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.060
Really? See the cream caps on these?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.840
The longer the milk sits,

00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:32.141
the firmer the cream becomes on top.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.800
And this creates a natural cream cap to the milk

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.741
and sealing the milk off to bacteria.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.840
You can see all the cream separating from the milk.

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:44.641
So the heavier cream will come to the top

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:47.101
and the lighter cream and the milk will stay underneath.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.100
The store bought milk that you buy from Walmart or whatever

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.860
is homogenized

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.100
so that the milk and cream is put under extreme pressure,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.920
and it makes the fat molecules very. So something. I'm a scientist,

00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:07.661
but, you know, it makes the cream stay mixed inside the milk.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.380
Well, this is raw milk,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.360
and it hasn't been under a marginization or pasteurization.

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:18.841
So this cream is gonna stay as nature intended.

00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:20.781
It's gonna raise to the top of this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.080
still very thick cream on top.

00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:25.061
Let's scoop it out.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.140
So another cream cap.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.840
Now I'm gonna get this all cleaned up and get stood up

00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:37.081
ready to turn I'm going to turn this milk into butter.

00:01:37.082 --> 00:01:40.321
I'm gonna use a food processor because it's the most convenient,

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:42.221
cleanest and efficient way to do it.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.040
Um, yes,

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.761
I could use a butter churn, but I'm just not going to. Um,

00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:48.141
yes, I could use my Kitchenaid mixer.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.480
Um, that just makes a mess.

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:52.041
I wanna wanna walk away from it and let it do its thing

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:53.421
while I do something else.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.720
So I'm gonna clean all this up.

00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:56.521
I'm actually gonna let.

00:01:56.522 --> 00:01:57.921
This is the cream I collected,

00:01:57.922 --> 00:02:00.921
so half a gallon and the quart right here,

00:02:00.922 --> 00:02:04.741
I'm gonna let this sit at room temperature and get warm. Um,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.860
cause that makes better butter faster.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.060
Um, if it's at room temperature now skims the milk.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.860
All this milk has different destinations.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.600
Some of them know this about this hours and go out to the pigs,

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.181
chickens and dogs.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.320
The dogs do like raw milk.

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:19.761
I do mix in with their food.

00:02:19.762 --> 00:02:22.361
So this milk right here is gonna head into the refrigerator

00:02:22.362 --> 00:02:23.581
for the kids to drink

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.580
and for cooking.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.440
The milk here on one side is gonna be made into mozzarella,

00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.881
and the milk here on the right is gonna go out to the apples.

00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:33.121
Although cream is at completely room temperature,

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:33.881
still kind of cold,

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:35.441
but it will work.

00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:37.141
I just got done making the mozzarella

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.220
and now we're gonna blend up this cream.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.700
10 years old and it's still doing me good. So

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.340
let's go.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.260
So The cream goes through several stages.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.020
It goes to whipped cream,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.740
and then it splits off into butter.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.300
My blender is definitely overfilled.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.660
Comes with strain out,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.220
and I'm just left with pure,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.420
raw spring Jersey butter.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.460
Nothing better.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.780
Can you please
