00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.060
So that last TikTok video I made about me going to Charleston

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.240
and just talking about masculinity

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.241
and how I felt like I.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.821
There just wasn't a whole lot of masculine men around.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.000
Um, it's,

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.601
you know, got thousands of comments now

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:18.901
and just so many people on there having discussions

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.300
and a lot of. It's really hateful.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.480
And that's fine, whatever.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:24.241
But

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:30.101
all these people that are hating on the idea of men being masculine,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.640
they have a very warped idea of what masculinity really is here.

00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:39.801
But masculinity is so much more then just being brawny

00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:42.521
and having big muscles and being able to beat people up.

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:43.281
Like, that's.

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:45.961
That's not my definition of masculine.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:46.441
Like, sure,

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:52.181
that can go with it, but my definition is a man that's a strong leader,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.000
he's brave, he'll protect you,

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.641
he's competent, he's responsible for his family,

00:00:57.642 --> 00:00:58.881
for the well being of his family,

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:00.621
for providing for his family,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.720
and he loves unconditionally.

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:05.181
That's my definition of masculine.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.360
And all the people that are hating on it

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:12.761
have very obviously been hurt by some men in their life,

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:15.021
and it's very heartbreaking.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.300
Just please know that there are good men out there still,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.560
and not every man is out to be controlling and dominating

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.281
and make you a doormat.

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:30.521
And all of these super negative things that people think that,

00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:34.041
that's just not true. Yes,

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:37.461
there's some like that, but those are the crooked ones or the bad ones.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.400
There's a Lot of good men out there that are gonna hold your heart

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.281
and protect you and love you and your family and your kids

00:01:44.282 --> 00:01:48.421
if you have them and do what's right no matter what.
