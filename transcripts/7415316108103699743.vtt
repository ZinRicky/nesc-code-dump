Upgrade your audio. If you're making content,

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:07.461
you need to make sure your audio is crisp.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.760
Let me show you what it's like without a microphone.

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:11.341
And then I'm gonna plug it in.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.520
Now we can see the difference.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.081
Sometimes it's so powerful,

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:23.481
I have to hold it kind of far away.

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:24.241
Otherwise it's, like,

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:27.701
really loud. It's a really powerful microphone.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.860
And let me show you how far I can go and it still works.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.420
I'm walking.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.980
I'm walking. I know you can still hear me.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.140
I'm walking,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.700
still going. I'm way,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.640
way out here, and I'm super far from my phone,

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:54.101
but you can hear me because of the microphone.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.780
So if you wanna upgrade your content creation,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.125
upgrade your audio. It's linked right here if you want one.
