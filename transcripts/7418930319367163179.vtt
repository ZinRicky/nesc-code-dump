00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
We live in Southwest Florida,

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:04.521
and late last night, early this morning,

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:05.681
we started getting the outer,

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:07.921
dirty bands of Hurricane Helene.

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:12.481
And with those outer bands comes thunderstorms and tornadoes.

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:14.881
And unfortunately, this morning,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.801
a tornado touched down on our property

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:18.581
where we have our construction office.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.320
And we have a ton of property damage

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:25.721
and damage to our equipment and trucks and our building.

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.121
So, honestly,

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:29.941
we're not expecting this after Hurricane Ian.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.480
Like, the property was okay,

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:35.201
but this is a totally different story.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.841
So I am on my way over there now to help with cleanup

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.701
and just take pictures and assess all the damage.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.800
So, yeah.

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:44.516
So, long day of cleanup ahead of us.
