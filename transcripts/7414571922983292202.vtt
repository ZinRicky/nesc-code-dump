00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
I'm gonna share with you how easy it is to make your own

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.441
homemade ketchup. Now,

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:07.441
I love eating the store bought main brand ketchup,

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:09.821
but I'm telling you, this tastes better.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.880
I'm using heirloom tomatoes,

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:14.361
but you can pretty much use any tomatoes that you come across

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:16.141
from the store or in your garden.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.920
I prefer heirloom tomatoes,

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:20.001
but it's totally up to you which type you use.

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:23.261
I did rinse these off in the vinegar bath in the sink,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.440
and then I bought them over to my big stock pot,

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:28.721
and I'm gonna boil these just until they soften

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:30.821
so I can easily remove the skin.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.800
There is other ways to remove the skin,

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.601
but this is just the way I'm doing it today.

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:36.281
I'm gonna use this food mill.

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:38.841
I did see this in a thrift store a few months ago

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:40.041
and I didn't even know what it was,

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.041
but I grabbed it anyway thinking

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:46.141
one day I will use you as I just love finding vintage kitchen gadgets.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.540
So I use the mill to remove all the skin and the seeds,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.920
and then I boiled the juices down for about three hours

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.621
until I was left with more like a paste substance.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.220
This is what we're gonna use to make the ketchup.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.880
Now to this, I'm gonna add a boatload of sugar.

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:03.441
If you didn't know, ketchup has a lot of sugar.

00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:07.561
Most store bought ketchups have high fructose corn syrup in it.

00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:08.901
Always read your Labels.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.260
Then I'm gonna add a bunch of salt and seasonings.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.200
You can add different seasonings to your ketchup for your preference.

00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:16.401
If you like spicy ketchup,

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:18.101
you can add more cayenne pepper.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.480
As I did add cayenne pepper,

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:22.181
but only half a teaspoon. Then I'm gonna add vinegar.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.920
This is what's gonna help preserve the ketchup.

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:27.001
You need a high acidity level for cannon

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:28.721
and let that cook down again

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:31.241
until I get more of a ketchup like substance.

00:01:31.242 --> 00:01:34.801
Once I'm happy with the thickness of the ketchup and then gonna can it.

00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:37.101
I'm using my digital pressure canner.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.720
But you don't have to use this.

00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:41.521
You can just use a regular big pot to water bath.

00:01:41.522 --> 00:01:43.521
I'm only water bathing these in here.

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:45.061
I'm not pressure canning them.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.520
You don't need to pressure can tomato products

00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:50.221
cause they have a lot of acidity in them.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.960
Plus for the vinegar there is no need to pressure can.

00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:57.261
I'm just gonna water bath these for 10 minutes in the digital canner.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.200
I absolutely love this crochet canner.

00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:01.841
It's one of my favourite things in the kitchen,

00:02:01.842 --> 00:02:03.461
but definitely not necessary.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.120
More of a luxury item. Once the cans were done processing,

00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:11.101
I let them cool on the counter before I put them in the pantry.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.780
The full recipe is available on my blog.
