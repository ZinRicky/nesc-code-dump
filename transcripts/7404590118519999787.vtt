Since whimsy has been born,

00:01.441 --> 00:04.601
I've been struggling with my eczema so bad.

00:04.602 --> 00:06.641
It usually starts on my palms,

00:06.642 --> 00:09.001
which have been really inflamed lately.

00:09.002 --> 00:12.441
Always make sure to take my seed DSO one symbiotic,

00:12.442 --> 00:14.521
especially when I'm feeling extra stressed.

00:14.522 --> 00:17.681
My eczema is flaring up. We have a lot of travel coming up.

00:17.682 --> 00:22.001
There's always a direct link between my gut health and my skin,

00:22.002 --> 00:24.321
so I know that when my gut health is off,

00:24.322 --> 00:26.741
my skin is probably gonna be off in vice versa.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.760
Also, with a lot of travel coming up,

00:28.761 --> 00:32.601
I wanna make sure my immune system is as strong as it can be.

00:32.602 --> 00:35.461
This is a 24 strain probiotic blend.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.940
I usually take two capsules before my breakfast every morning.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.640
If you're dealing with eczema,

00:41.641 --> 00:43.261
skin issues, bloating,

00:43.520 --> 00:44.520
low immune function,

00:44.521 --> 00:47.598
it's definitely worth it looking into getting a probiotic.
