00:00.040 --> 00:03.320
Here's everything I prepped to make my week just a little bit easier.

00:03.321 --> 00:05.721
I started off by making some Cheez its.

00:05.722 --> 00:07.161
Once the dough came together,

00:07.162 --> 00:09.321
I refrigerated it for about an hour

00:09.322 --> 00:11.381
while I prepped all my other things.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.280
It was time to bake my sour dough bread.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.681
I do about two or three loafs a week.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.481
I scored my bread

00:16.482 --> 00:20.241
and then popped it in the oven for 45 minutes before letting it cool.

00:20.242 --> 00:22.361
We've been having a lot of pasta lately,

00:22.362 --> 00:24.321
so I wanted some sauce handy with that,

00:24.322 --> 00:25.641
so I made a Bolognese.

00:25.642 --> 00:28.021
I started off by chopping some celery,

00:28.240 --> 00:29.120
carrot, onion,

00:29.121 --> 00:31.801
letting that go on the stove before adding my ground meat,

00:31.802 --> 00:33.021
some red wine,

00:33.040 --> 00:33.960
my tomato sauce,

00:33.961 --> 00:34.561
some herbs.

00:34.562 --> 00:38.401
And I always save my Parmesan rinds to pop in my sauce to simmer.

00:38.402 --> 00:41.441
I usually let that simmer anywhere from three to six hours,

00:41.442 --> 00:42.601
but while that was going,

00:42.602 --> 00:45.601
I wanted to make something quick to grab as a snack,

00:45.602 --> 00:47.241
so I made some lemon Poppy seed.

00:47.242 --> 00:50.201
Muffins are perfect for when spring rolls around.

00:50.202 --> 00:52.601
They only take about 15 minutes in the oven.

00:52.602 --> 00:54.761
I also had potatoes that needed to go,

00:54.762 --> 00:56.681
so I boiled them for a couple minutes

00:56.682 --> 00:59.761
before tossing them in my lemon mustard marinade.

00:59.762 --> 01:01.041
And whenever I wanna have them,

01:01.042 --> 01:04.001
I just pull them out and bake them to get them all crispy.

01:04.002 --> 01:05.801
By this time, my dough had chilled enough,

01:05.802 --> 01:07.401
so I rolled it out,

01:07.402 --> 01:11.161
sliced it up, and Assembled all of my little crackers on a baking sheet,

01:11.162 --> 01:12.841
bake them until the edges got brown,

01:12.842 --> 01:15.361
and then transfer them over once they were cooled.

01:15.362 --> 01:17.561
I thought the muffins needed a little lemon glaze,

01:17.720 --> 01:21.460
I mix some lemon juice and powdered sugar to go on top of the muffins,

01:21.560 --> 01:25.420
put half of them away, and the other half were eaten almost immediately.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.600
Also remembered that I got some peaches,

01:27.601 --> 01:30.241
so I wanted to make peach and lime jam.

01:30.242 --> 01:31.441
I didn't want it too thick,

01:31.442 --> 01:32.801
so I found a happy medium

01:32.802 --> 01:36.141
so I could also spread it on top of oatmeal or waffles.

01:36.320 --> 01:39.160
And to grab this Asian pickled cucumber salad. A lot.

01:39.161 --> 01:40.401
So I made a new batch,

01:40.402 --> 01:41.841
seasoned it with some Marin,

01:41.842 --> 01:43.721
sesame oil, chili flakes,

01:43.722 --> 01:44.981
rice wine vinegar,

01:45.040 --> 01:46.160
and put that aside.

01:46.161 --> 01:49.785
Then I transferred my Bolognese over, and this is everything I prepped.
