00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.360
Since you brought it up,

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.160
let me mention that

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.180
these pans are not a traditional nonstick.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.560
They are ceramic coated.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.240
They have, like,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.500
a special ceramic coating over the whole entire pan.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.860
The metal underneath,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.400
and then it's coated with ceramic,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.560
so there's none of the lead,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.260
cadmium, PFIs,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.220
all those nasty things.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.240
Another thing that I love,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.120
since the way you put the handle on

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.240
is you put it on,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.880
and then when you squeeze it,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.180
and that's how it closes,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.080
as you're taking it to the sink

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.880
to drain something or move it,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.000
there's no way it's gonna fit.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.640
You're only holding it tighter.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.860
And then it's just super easy to let it go.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.760
Since one of my kids is disabled,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.180
this was amazing

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.120
because she likes to pretend plane.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.080
If I have to go,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.120
even just pee for three seconds

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.000
while I have something on the stove,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.880
I don't want her grabbing the.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.600
The handle so I can take it off,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.640
make it completely safe,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000
but I can put it right back on to keep cooking,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.840
and I guess it's there.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.800
That's like some incredible nonstick.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.960
You can see this pan,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.400
I actually cooked in it,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.560
but you just wipe it with.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.500
I'm gonna wash it with soap and water, but

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.260
it wipes out like nothing.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.960
So these pans are amazing.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.120
They are non toxic nonstick

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.760
because it's a ceramic coating.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.540
And handle coming off,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.920
it's just amazing.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.560
I love them.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.200
The link is right here.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.004
