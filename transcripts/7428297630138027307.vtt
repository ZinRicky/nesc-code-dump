00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.880
The quickest way to ruin your relationship or marriage

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:06.600
is by not appreciating your partner

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:11.120
I just saw a TikTok about this girl saying that her husband came home from work

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:13.240
and she's a stay at home girlfriend

00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:14.200
they don't have any kids

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:15.340
they just have a cat

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.240
and he tells her “it looks like you've done nothing all day”

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.160
and she's upset rightfully so

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:22.160
this is the way to ruin your relationship

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:24.440
by not appreciating each other

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.240
I'm the first person to give men the benefit of doubt

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.960
maybe he's had a hard day

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:32.560
but that still should never be taken out on your partner

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:34.600
That fairy that restocks the fridge

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:38.920
restocks toiletry restocks and cleans everything behind you

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:40.760
women are usually those fairies

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:42.480
okay if you want your partner

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:45.200
your little fairy to continue doing those things

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:47.280
I suggest you appreciate it

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.320
and never ever

00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:51.177
ever tell your partner it looks like you've done nothing all day
