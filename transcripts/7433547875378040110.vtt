This has been my favorite late night snack lately.

00:03.561 --> 00:05.761
It's currently almost 12:00,

00:05.762 --> 00:08.081
but I needed a little late night snack.

00:08.082 --> 00:10.801
And this has been my favorite thing to make lately.

00:10.802 --> 00:14.141
It's Granny Smith apples with homemade caramel

00:14.240 --> 00:17.620
and some crushed up homemade pretzels.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.040
You guys, there's nothing better.

00:20.041 --> 00:23.121
I don't know what it is. It has to be Granny Smith apples.

00:23.122 --> 00:24.601
It can't be a honey crisp.

00:24.602 --> 00:26.261
It has to be kind of more tart.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.440
Caramel is really sweet,

00:30.441 --> 00:34.041
and then the pretzel is kind of crunchy and salty at the same time,

00:34.042 --> 00:35.621
which is such a good combination.

00:37.440 --> 00:41.800
Basically a caramel apple without having to go through the work

00:41.801 --> 00:43.758
and adding some pretzels on top.
