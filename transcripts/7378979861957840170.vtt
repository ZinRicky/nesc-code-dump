00:01.280 --> 00:01.800
Okay,

00:01.801 --> 00:05.641
so we are about two weeks away from getting our cows at the dairy barn.

00:05.642 --> 00:09.401
So I want to show you what the barn is looking like right now.

00:09.402 --> 00:12.481
So up here is the overlook deck.

00:12.482 --> 00:15.381
So you can come up here and see into the milk parlor.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.820
You can see that here is where the cows eat,

00:18.840 --> 00:23.400
and they'll always have free access to the pastures outside.

00:23.401 --> 00:24.941
It's a pasture based dairy.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.600
Those black mats that you're seeing are actually cow water beds.

00:28.601 --> 00:30.201
So when the cows lay down,

00:30.202 --> 00:32.541
it's very comfortable on the joints.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.960
There's just tons of natural light in here,

00:34.961 --> 00:37.101
which is what Daniel and I wanted.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.660
And then this room I'm super excited about.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.440
This is actually our milk bottling room.

00:44.441 --> 00:47.401
So you'll see in here that we have the sinks in here.

00:47.402 --> 00:50.561
And this is where we bottle all the fresh milk.

00:50.562 --> 00:53.741
The tank is on the other side of the wall.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.400
Fresh milk will come in here,

00:55.401 --> 00:56.281
we'll bottle it,

00:56.282 --> 00:58.341
and then we'll be able to sell it.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.320
Fresh milk straight to you guys,

01:00.321 --> 01:02.041
which we're super excited about.

01:02.042 --> 01:03.441
And then out here,

01:03.442 --> 01:07.974
Haley is finishing the Ballerina Farm sign.
