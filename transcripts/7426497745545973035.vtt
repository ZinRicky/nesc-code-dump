Few months ago, Lindsay and I flew all the way to New York

00:03.201 --> 00:06.161
to work with one of my favorite beauty brands, lineage.

00:06.162 --> 00:08.041
And the ones that have been around for a while

00:08.042 --> 00:10.441
know how much I love their lip sleeping mask,

00:10.442 --> 00:13.361
how much I use it. So when they wanted to shoot me for it,

00:13.362 --> 00:15.321
I obviously had to say yes.

00:15.322 --> 00:17.121
Made it to set bright and early.

00:17.122 --> 00:18.801
Got a good look at all the outfits,

00:18.802 --> 00:21.281
and then we headed into glam doing makeup,

00:21.282 --> 00:22.541
nails, and hair.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.400
So I got dressed,

00:23.401 --> 00:26.601
we did all the touch UPS we needed before heading on set.

00:26.602 --> 00:28.561
After photographing the first outfit,

00:28.562 --> 00:30.881
we realized that we needed an outfit change,

00:30.882 --> 00:33.501
so I picked this little Barbie inspired dress.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.360
We shot the lip sleeping mask in the midnight Minis.

00:36.361 --> 00:38.561
Found this aura reading person on set,

00:38.562 --> 00:40.921
and she read my aura, which was so fun.

00:40.922 --> 00:43.241
I loved seeing my little aura picture.

00:43.242 --> 00:45.001
Also had some lunch, did touch UPS,

00:45.002 --> 00:47.521
and then it was time to shoot all the social stuff.

00:47.522 --> 00:49.601
Any TikToks, any story posts.

00:49.602 --> 00:51.761
I also always love seeing all the planning

00:51.762 --> 00:53.401
that goes on behind the scenes.

00:53.402 --> 00:54.481
I couldn't help myself

00:54.482 --> 00:57.281
but try all the lip sleeping masks while shooting,

00:57.282 --> 00:59.118
but once all that was done, we wrapped.
