00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.760
if you're a homeschooling mom to a preschooler

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:03.120
and you need something to do over the summer break

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:04.840
this is a great way to start our alphabet

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:08.120
we already do the good and beautiful preschool curriculum

00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:10.520
but this is a great way to help my daughter practice her apple

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:12.140
case and lowercase letters

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.720
she absolutely loved that

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:15.400
it was ice cream which really engaged her

00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:18.000
and the colours made it so much easier for her to focus

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.680
these are solid pieces the quality feels amazing

00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:22.420
and they will last a lifetime

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.640
easy to clean and wipe down

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:25.520
and so much fun for the whole family to play with

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:26.720
do we mash all the letters up

00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:28.400
we started lining them up in the alphabets

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:30.600
this also helped her get her alphabet down

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:33.140
I don't know why they're still in stock before the home school runs
