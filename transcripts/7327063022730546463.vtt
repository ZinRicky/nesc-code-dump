00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.840
as a fat person

00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:02.041
I struggle with overconsumption

00:00:02.042 --> 00:00:02.881
Iâ€™m talking about shopping

00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:05.281
I have such a love for clothing and fashion

00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:07.081
but because I'm a larger fat person

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:11.621
it's really difficult to find clothing that I like in my size

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.820
growing up there is almost never clothing that I wanted to wear in my size

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.800
so in the last few years

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.521
we've made progress in plus size clothing

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:22.441
so when I find clothes now that I like and like

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:24.161
they're making things that I wanna wear

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:25.761
I immediately jump on it and I buy it

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:26.601
because being fat

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:28.641
sometimes just clothing items that I've never seen

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:30.521
and never thought will be made in my size

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:32.121
and I don't know if like

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:32.801
it's gonna last

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:33.721
if it's gonna be sold out

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:34.641
if they're gonna make it again

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:36.001
but the problem with that is

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.361
sometimes I end up buying things that I don't end up wearing and like

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:40.201
I have no use for

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:40.601
but I'm like

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:41.961
I wanna buy it just like

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:42.921
in case I need it

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:47.201
and I really wish that I could be more intentional with the way that I shop

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:49.201
but we've literally seen in the last few months

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:52.561
how plus size clothing is being kind of walked back

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:54.201
like stores that were like oh hey

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:56.141
I'm size inclusive are now like

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.120
just kidding and like 

00:00:58.121 --> 00:00:59.241
we're seeing in real time

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:00.961
like my fear

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:03.321
the one that I was having is valid

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:04.341
and it's like

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.000
how do I combat that over consumption

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:12.481
when I know there genuinely is a real possibility that item might literally

00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:13.841
never exist ever again

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:15.641
and also so I'm the type of person where like

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.481
I'll find something that I really like

00:01:17.482 --> 00:01:19.761
and I'll just wear it consistently

00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:20.681
like at least once a week

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:21.081
you know what I mean

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:22.001
like very very often

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:23.121
I'm like a cartoon character

00:01:23.122 --> 00:01:24.241
like I have like my you know

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:25.361
my set outfits right

00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:29.201
but the clothes are also not made well

00:01:29.202 --> 00:01:30.241
like plus size

00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:33.981
people often don't really get good quality

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.920
like options

00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:35.601
you know so there's

00:01:35.602 --> 00:01:36.801
like of course

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:38.641
they're gonna run through quickly

00:01:38.642 --> 00:01:39.981
especially if you're wearing them often

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.720
and so now I'm in a position where like

00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:45.241
if I have something that I like and I like

00:01:45.242 --> 00:01:46.041
get the use out of it

00:01:46.042 --> 00:01:47.441
and I wear it it

00:01:47.442 --> 00:01:48.761
it'll be like

00:01:48.762 --> 00:01:50.001
unwearable in a few years

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:53.361
and I don't even have the option to pay more

00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:55.321
to get a better quality garment that will last

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:56.081
like a lifetime

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:57.441
so I have literally no choice

00:01:57.442 --> 00:01:58.401
I'm sitting here like

00:01:58.402 --> 00:02:00.321
debating rebuying this like

00:02:00.322 --> 00:02:01.601
black velvet dress that I like

00:02:01.602 --> 00:02:02.801
that I wear all the time

00:02:02.802 --> 00:02:03.921
but the straps are already

00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:04.881
like peeling off

00:02:04.882 --> 00:02:05.681
and I might like

00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:07.241
I'm gonna sew it just like

00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:09.681
to get more use out of the dress but like

00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:11.441
uh it's so frustrating

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:12.521
like literally

00:02:12.522 --> 00:02:13.441
either my choices are like

00:02:13.442 --> 00:02:16.001
buy three of the same dress that you like so you know

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:16.681
you will have it

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:17.561
or just like

00:02:17.562 --> 00:02:18.521
wear it till it falls apart

00:02:18.522 --> 00:02:20.081
because it's gonna fall apart

00:02:20.082 --> 00:02:22.201
because they don't make quality clothes for plus size people

00:02:22.202 --> 00:02:23.441
oh my god ugh

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:25.641
anyway and I'm an anti capitalist like I

00:02:25.642 --> 00:02:29.561
I inherently do not support over consumption

00:02:29.562 --> 00:02:33.001
but I am an over consumer when it comes to fashion and

00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:34.041
like shopping

00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:35.441
because of this exact reason

00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:37.241
and I'm not gonna get into how expensive this is

00:02:37.242 --> 00:02:40.081
like it is a privilege to be able to rebuy the clothes that I want

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:40.841
but like it's just

00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:41.641
it's not fair

00:02:41.642 --> 00:02:42.961
it's not fair that we have to do that

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:43.441
like these like

00:02:43.442 --> 00:02:44.041
fast fashion

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:46.001
cheap clothes are not a problem just for fat people

00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:47.081
it's a problem for everyone

00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:49.481
but thin people can at least go to like

00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:51.161
a thrift store and get old

00:02:51.162 --> 00:02:51.721
vintage like

00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:52.881
quality made clothes

00:02:52.882 --> 00:02:54.161
but like obviously I

00:02:54.162 --> 00:02:54.761
as fat person

00:02:54.762 --> 00:02:55.601
cannot do that

00:02:55.602 --> 00:02:57.121
so I'm literally at a thrift store

00:02:57.122 --> 00:02:58.281
I am sitting in a parking lot

00:02:58.282 --> 00:02:58.721
at the store

00:02:58.722 --> 00:02:59.521
making this rant

00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:00.441
because I'm so

00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:03.201
I'm so like upset about this whole situation so I don't

00:03:03.202 --> 00:03:06.001
this is also why plus size people get mad at thin people

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:08.041
who take plus size clothing from thrift stores 

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:08.401
because like

00:03:08.402 --> 00:03:09.241
obviously it's a thrift store

00:03:09.242 --> 00:03:10.361
first come first or whatever

00:03:10.362 --> 00:03:10.881
do what you want

00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:12.841
but also there's so little of it

00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:15.981
that actual plus size people can't shop at thrift store sucks

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.040
I literally sent my sister in

00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:17.401
and I'm like

00:03:17.402 --> 00:03:19.441
I'm gonna go in at the end to look at the jewelry and like

00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:21.001
the three pieces that are in my size

00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:22.301
because obviously

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.720
obviously there's no vintage

00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:25.631
plus size clothing so anyways
