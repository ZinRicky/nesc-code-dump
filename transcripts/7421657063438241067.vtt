00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.680
  I hate to be the one to break it to the Billy's of the world 

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:08.400
but your own mother may very well be one of these murderers herself

00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:11.840
we know that 25% of women have an abortion in their lifetime

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:17.600
and of that 25% six out of ten are already mothers

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:20.240
one of the main reasons people report wanting to have an abortion

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:23.700
is that they can be a better parent to the kids they already have

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.640
all of us have benefited from abortion

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:29.400
whether it is that your mother was able to be a better parent to you

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:32.400
whether it was that she had an abortion before you

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:35.160
so that she could have healthy planned pregnancy later

00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.000
which was you find yourself saying well

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.200
I don't know any women who have had an abortion

00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:41.620
the women around me don't do that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.920
yes they do

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:47.260
they are just well aware of the fact that you are not a safe person to tell

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.600
it is 25% of the women around you

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:50.880
it is your mother's friends

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:53.240
your sisters it is rich women

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:55.620
poor women religious women

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.240
women who are not religious

00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.000
women from all different cultures and backgrounds

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.680
so as much as I hate your energy

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.490
I'm glad that you have also benefited from abortion
