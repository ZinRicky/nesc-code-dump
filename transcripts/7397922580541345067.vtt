People that have been around for a while

00:01.801 --> 00:03.481
know how much I love hourglass

00:03.482 --> 00:05.001
and how much I love blush.

00:05.002 --> 00:07.561
When they came out with these new liquid blushes,

00:07.562 --> 00:11.121
I knew that I had to try them and I instantly fell in love.

00:11.122 --> 00:12.801
They have such a natural finish,

00:12.802 --> 00:14.421
but they're still buildable.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.200
They're super easy to apply,

00:16.201 --> 00:19.761
so I usually start by applying them on the high points of my cheek

00:19.762 --> 00:23.721
and then blend them out before moving on to my nose and my brow bone.

00:23.722 --> 00:25.361
Come in so many different colors,

00:25.362 --> 00:27.681
but this one has been my favorite one lately.

00:27.682 --> 00:30.906
And then I have to finish off with a glossy lip to match my blush.
