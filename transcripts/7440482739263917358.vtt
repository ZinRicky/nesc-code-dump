00:00.160 --> 00:04.060
The biggest problem with today's relationships is everybody thinks 

00:04.061 --> 00:06.040
“you're supposed to meet my needs”

00:06.041 --> 00:09.160
when you say “I'm gonna leave if I don't get what I want”

00:09.161 --> 00:10.600
“if I don't get my needs met”

00:10.601 --> 00:12.457
that's very immature

00:12.458 --> 00:16.052
instead you should be in a relationship where you think that 

00:16.053 --> 00:17.560
THEIR needs are YOUR needs

00:17.561 --> 00:19.580
It should fuel you every day

00:19.680 --> 00:22.360
from the second you open your eyeballs in the morning

00:22.361 --> 00:24.360
to the second you lay your head down

00:24.361 --> 00:29.440
you should be thinking “I will do anything in my power to satisfy your needs”

00:29.441 --> 00:31.336
that is true passion and that 

00:31.337 --> 00:34.949
is the key essential component of any relationship
