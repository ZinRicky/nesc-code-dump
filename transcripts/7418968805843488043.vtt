00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.440
come with me to have lunch at tiffins and Animal Kingdom

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:05.240
this was our first time at Tiffins and we were so excited to try it

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:07.720
we have gone to the Nomad Lounge a ton of times

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:09.480
and that is located right next door

00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:12.200
right off the bat you could tell that this was a fancier experience

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:14.600
it is a bit of a higher price point for dining in Disney

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.720
so we also had high expectations

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:19.880
hostess explain that all the art is supposed to be observed gallery style

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.680
so go walk around the rooms and enjoy the art

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:23.400
we started off with a couple of cocktails

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:26.600
and then immediately got the bread service and the octopus appetizers

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:28.920
the bread service was 10 out of 10 incredible

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.640
and the octopus was fork tender

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:32.200
which if you know how to cook octopus

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:36.760
that is difficult next we have the living off the land salad and the duo of pork

00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:39.200
it was so fun to eat the lettuces that we saw growing at our

00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:42.000
behind the seed store and they were especially delicious

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.560
we both agreed that this is one of our new favourite restaurants

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:47.160
and we will be coming back from the service to the food

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:50.620
this was by far one of our best Disney dining experiences

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.200
and as always at Disney there is a kids menu

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:54.680
if your kids are kind of picky eaters

00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:57.800
they can still get regular things like chicken fingers or Mac and cheese

00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:58.720
let me know in the comments

00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:00.000
if you've ever eaten at tiffins

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.760
what your experience was and what your favourite Walt Disney World restaurant is

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.180
if you haven't tried tiffins it's time to go
