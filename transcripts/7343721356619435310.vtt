00:00.080 --> 00:01.360
My husband doesn't cook,

00:01.360 --> 00:02.480
but he does bake

00:02.480 --> 00:04.760
and he's really good at it. And lately

00:04.760 --> 00:07.400
I've just been violently craving cookie dough,

00:07.400 --> 00:09.900
so he made me his famous recipe.

00:09.960 --> 00:12.960
He started by combining some white and brown sugar

00:12.960 --> 00:15.900
with some room temperature butter and an egg.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.320
Give that really good mix

00:17.320 --> 00:19.700
until everything was really smooth.

00:19.880 --> 00:20.960
He gets very,

00:20.960 --> 00:23.160
very specific with his measurements,

00:23.160 --> 00:25.960
so he always has to make sure everything is level

00:25.960 --> 00:27.740
and perfectly measured out.

00:27.800 --> 00:28.640
Added some vanilla

00:28.640 --> 00:29.760
baking powder

00:29.760 --> 00:30.960
and flaky sea salt

00:30.960 --> 00:32.620
and then some flour

00:32.640 --> 00:35.860
and mix that until everything was incorporated

00:35.960 --> 00:39.900
before he added in some more flour and oats.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.920
I don't really like chocolate chips

00:41.920 --> 00:44.440
so he only added a few

00:44.440 --> 00:45.880
so that would be really easy

00:45.880 --> 00:47.600
for me to just pick them out.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.240
This is the best cookie dough recipe that I've

00:50.240 --> 00:51.320
ever tasted,

00:51.320 --> 00:53.640
so obviously we had to try it.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.160
And yes, it was as good as we both remembered it

00:56.160 --> 00:58.340
cause we haven't made this in a while.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.600
Then he plated me up some cookie dough

01:00.600 --> 01:03.600
before he formed his into little balls

01:03.600 --> 01:05.760
and place them on a baking sheet to bake.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.420
We pop them in the oven for about eight minutes at 400

01:09.440 --> 01:12.660
and then transfer them over to a wire rack to cool.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.720
I also made some homemade caramel sauce

01:14.720 --> 01:16.626
that we drizzled over a few of them.
