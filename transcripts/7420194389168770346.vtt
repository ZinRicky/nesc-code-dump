00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
We're on our final stretch of Fashion Month.

00:02.401 --> 00:03.761
We just got to Paris,

00:03.762 --> 00:07.281
where we're gonna be for the next few days before heading back home.

00:07.282 --> 00:11.141
Tonight, we're getting ready for the business of Fashion 500 gala.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.360
Lamb took us about three hours today,

00:13.361 --> 00:15.441
so we got started quite early.

00:15.442 --> 00:16.961
While I was getting my hair done,

00:16.962 --> 00:18.681
lucky started on his skin.

00:18.682 --> 00:21.081
Since I'm so particular about my makeup,

00:21.082 --> 00:23.441
I keep doing it myself. Lately,

00:23.442 --> 00:25.081
I was in a rush to get ready,

00:25.082 --> 00:26.601
so lucky tape my dress

00:26.602 --> 00:29.821
got me into it before warming whimsy up a bottle.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.360
This point, we were late,

00:31.361 --> 00:34.441
so we rushed to the car and made it onto the carpet.

00:34.442 --> 00:36.721
I was so cold and trying not to shiver,

00:36.722 --> 00:39.921
so I was very glad once we made it inside the building,

00:39.922 --> 00:42.781
we did all the pictures, all the press.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.040
A lot of the times that functions like these,

00:45.041 --> 00:47.441
my social anxiety kicks in a little bit.

00:47.442 --> 00:49.041
I can get quite overwhelming,

00:49.042 --> 00:51.821
but it's always nice to see familiar faces.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
We obviously went to the room with all the food first

00:55.001 --> 00:57.441
before going to mingle a little bit more.

00:57.442 --> 01:01.461
It's always fun seeing familiar faces and having fun conversations.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.080
But at this point, mom duties were calling me,

01:04.280 --> 01:08.500
lucky and I went to say hi to a bunch of you guys before heading home.
