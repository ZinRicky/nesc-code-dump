00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.500
women are just so sick of softening our language for the benefit of men

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.380
I don't think I've ever actually said that I hate men on this app

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:23.980
um I've obviously spoken a lot about how men behave and how men treat us

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.060
and the benefits of decentring men from your life

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.140
and men choose to interpret that as misandry

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.720
hatred of men and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.740
I always say and I love it when people say this is people tell you who they are

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.800
usually when someone accuses you of something

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.761
that is just not really making that much sense

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:45.881
or accuses someone of something that doesn't make that much sense

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:47.801
it's cause it's more about them

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.381
they're telling you who they are

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.660
they're seeing in others what's in themselves

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.180
so many men actually do have misogyny inside of them

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.580
and actually don't respect women and sometimes hate women

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.700
so when they hear women like me talk about men

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.140
they assume I hate men

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.100
and sometimes I wish that I did cause I think it would just be easier

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.740
but I think like

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.500
they don't understand the amount of patience and empathy we have for men like

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:30.740
that we can see beyond their hateful language and see that underneath that

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.880
they're actually struggling with the patriarchy in their own way

00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:43.801
just the way we are and that doesn't justify the way that they treat us

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:45.041
you know an explanation

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:46.841
not a justification etcetera

00:01:46.842 --> 00:01:51.141
but we know that when we speak about the behaviour of man

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.900
that the man who

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.800
other good ones won't be offended

00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:59.661
they won't be defensive they won't think it's about them

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.420
they won't feel the need to lash out

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.360
and that's the point

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:11.281
we don't have to Panda to the ones who are the least worth pandering to

00:02:11.282 --> 00:02:12.741
through our language

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.960
I don't know that there's many women who actually hate all men

00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:21.781
I'm sure that every woman has men in their life who they love and respect

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.800
and a lot of the time we're really just talking about hating patriarchy

00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:28.721
and hating how certain men treat us

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:31.321
and I think a lot of this nuance can be lost on this

00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:35.981
on these apps if women had done to men what men have done to women

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.620
men would hate us a lot more than we hate them

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.680
and I think it's funny that they are struggling to hold the contradictions

00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:48.081
that you might be strong and independent

00:02:48.082 --> 00:02:53.181
you might be a feminist and you might still love men

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.920
wanna have babies I mean

00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:59.821
I personally spent the afternoon mending things and sewing

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.220
and cleaning and cooking and like

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.820
you know like these things can all exist at once

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.080
but their goal is to put you in these binary categories

00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:15.501
good woman or bad woman

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.560
they the very essence of the problem

00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:22.481
is refusing to see women in their whole personhood

00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:24.901
and understand that we contain multitudes

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.680
women contain multitudes and we just ask that we're seen

00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:36.141
and respected as entire people and not put in these boxes

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.720
it's really important I think

00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:43.861
not to be able to be pinned down by men as a woman or defined by men as a woman

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.880
and that's because that's the very thing that they wanna be able to do

00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:51.821
and that's the very thing that will strip you of your full identity

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.840
and I think you know it

00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:57.981
I do get a certain level of pleasure from like

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.780
seeing when they are confused about who I am

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.020
because they'll think that they've got me pegged as this certain type of woman

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.820
a man hating lesbian

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.280
or desperately lonely and unhappy or absolutely no fun at all

00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:21.501
because it's much easier for them to just categorise a woman into ABC

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.080
cause we're so capable of so many things

00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:29.961
like we're capable of being feminist and loving men and having babies

00:04:29.962 --> 00:04:33.341
and hating patriarchy and hating some men

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.620
and hating cooking and loving cleaning

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.280
and hating our jobs and loving our jobs and wanting to be housewives

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.161
and then wanting to go out and get careers

00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:46.221
and we're just capable of like all of it

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.960
and we're just asking that we have the freedom to exercise our agency

00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:56.381
in this world without being judged disrespected

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.500
questioned made to feel unsafe

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.940
just in the same way that men are automatically given their agency

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.500
called entitlement in this world
