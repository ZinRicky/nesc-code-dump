00:00.080 --> 00:01.560
we don't hate Taylor Swift

00:01.561 --> 00:04.015
we hate the unabashed,

00:04.016 --> 00:05.520
idolatrous,

00:05.521 --> 00:07.560
cult-like worship of her

00:07.561 --> 00:08.520
that's what we hate

00:08.521 --> 00:10.000
that's what we are annoyed by

00:10.001 --> 00:11.800
she might be a fine person

00:11.801 --> 00:13.040
she might be a nice person

00:13.041 --> 00:15.240
I have absolutely no idea

00:15.241 --> 00:17.120
her music might be fine to some people

00:17.121 --> 00:18.740
there are a few songs that I like

00:18.760 --> 00:22.400
but none of us know her well enough to say if we hate her or love her

00:22.401 --> 00:24.120
or know her character or anything

00:24.121 --> 00:24.760
like come on

00:24.761 --> 00:26.200
but Taylor Swift is not the problem

00:26.201 --> 00:29.960
it's the people who say that they will vote for whoever she votes for

00:29.961 --> 00:31.000
it's you people

00:31.001 --> 00:34.000
it's the people putting Taylor Swift shirts on Jesus

00:34.001 --> 00:37.920
and literally worshipping this girl that they've never met

00:37.921 --> 00:39.600
that they don't know anything about

00:39.601 --> 00:42.260
they would do anything for her that is

00:42.920 --> 00:44.240
that is what's annoying

00:44.241 --> 00:45.680
that's what's weird

00:45.681 --> 00:47.564
and it's fine to think that.

00:47.565 --> 00:48.440
we don't know

00:48.441 --> 00:49.520
we can't hate her

00:49.521 --> 00:50.880
so when the Swifties are like

00:50.881 --> 00:52.400
“you guys hate her so much” like

00:52.401 --> 00:53.500
we don't hate her

00:53.680 --> 00:56.600
we don't know her well enough to hate her or to love her

00:56.601 --> 00:57.620
nobody hates her

00:58.160 --> 01:01.122
we hate the worship of her
