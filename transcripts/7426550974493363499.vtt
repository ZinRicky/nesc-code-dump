00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.260
Just a quick question for pro choices.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.200
How would you feel if your parents wanted to unalive?

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:05.921
Men are, like,

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.761
shockingly unhelpful. Like,

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:13.401
women are suffering and dying from abortion bans.

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:17.461
Abortion bans have increased the infant mortality rate,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.080
and they're out here like,

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:21.061
your hypothetically a fetus

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.800
and your parent wanted to hypothetically abort you,

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.201
how would that make you feel?

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:28.161
It's like our healthcare and our lives

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:33.001
and the consequences of these actual policies are very real,

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:35.941
and you're out here having some type of, like,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.840
thought experiment,

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:43.361
hypothetical philosophical debate with yourself or another guy.

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:45.321
In my comments the other day was like,

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:49.801
I'm here fighting for all the future women who don't have a voice.

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:53.201
It's like there's women in front of you right now who have voices,

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:54.321
and we're trying to talk to you,

00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:55.361
and you just keep ignoring.

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:56.041
I, like,

00:00:56.042 --> 00:01:00.973
you can't even help the ones right in front of you. I just.
