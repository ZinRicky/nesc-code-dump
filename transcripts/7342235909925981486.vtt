00:00.080 --> 00:01.680
Here's everything I eat in a day

00:01.680 --> 00:03.440
as someone that loves to cook,

00:03.440 --> 00:04.960
is 34 weeks pregnant,

00:04.960 --> 00:07.360
but is having a really lazy cooking day.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.800
Had to start my day off with a cup of robus tea

00:09.800 --> 00:10.760
and some milk.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.180
I also hate the taste of water, so today

00:13.320 --> 00:16.280
I opted for some iced water with some apple juice

00:16.280 --> 00:17.720
just to stay hydrated

00:17.720 --> 00:19.640
and then moved on to making my breakfast.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.880
I've been into savoury and sweet breakfast,

00:21.880 --> 00:25.520
so I decided on caramelized soy mushrooms

00:25.520 --> 00:28.040
on one side of the toast and tomato on the other.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.800
I also had some of my kids leftover oatmeal

00:30.800 --> 00:33.500
with some peach vanilla puree and banana.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.360
And I always need a lunch pick me up,

00:35.360 --> 00:38.840
so I had a culture pop and an iced lavender honey tea.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.720
Since we're sticking to quick and easy meals,

00:40.720 --> 00:42.360
I did a baked potato

00:42.360 --> 00:44.640
with some quick pickled sumoc onions,

00:44.640 --> 00:46.240
a kimchi tartar sauce,

00:46.240 --> 00:48.280
and honey mustard salmon.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.680
While the potato was baking,

00:49.680 --> 00:53.020
I made my sides and marinated my salmon.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.960
And 15 minutes before the potato was done roasting,

00:55.960 --> 00:57.360
I popped the salmon in,

00:57.360 --> 00:58.280
let that roast,

00:58.280 --> 01:00.880
and then assembled it all with butter,

01:00.880 --> 01:02.480
the salmon, tartar sauce,

01:02.480 --> 01:04.200
dill, and the pickled onions.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.140
You guys, this was divine.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.840
Love a little afternoon pick me up.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.280
So I had this coconut

01:09.280 --> 01:12.040
mango smoothie that I have almost every single day

01:12.040 --> 01:13.840
and this sumo citrus.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.600
They've been one of my pregnancy cravings

01:15.600 --> 01:17.780
and I need to have one at Least every day

01:17.840 --> 01:19.120
dinner time rolled around,

01:19.120 --> 01:21.000
I wanted something comforting.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
I've been thinking about making gnocchi soup

01:23.000 --> 01:23.680
for so long,

01:23.680 --> 01:25.000
so that's what I did today.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.400
I chopped up some carrots,

01:26.400 --> 01:27.580
celery, and onion.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.880
Let that sweat down with some sun dried tomato oil

01:30.880 --> 01:33.680
before adding some Calabrian chili tomato paste,

01:33.680 --> 01:35.120
adding my shredded chicken.

01:35.120 --> 01:35.800
In the meantime,

01:35.800 --> 01:39.360
my husband was making us an arugula Parmesan salad.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.960
Also needed to use up some kale,

01:40.960 --> 01:42.440
so I tossed it in there as well

01:42.440 --> 01:43.920
before adding my cauliflower

01:43.920 --> 01:45.740
gnocchi and dressing the salad.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.120
Plated up my dinner,

01:47.120 --> 01:49.640
added some lemon and Parmesan cheese on top.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.120
I was starving at this point,

01:51.120 --> 01:52.080
so I couldn't wait.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.240
And I burnt my mouth,

01:53.240 --> 01:55.180
but it was definitely worth it.
