00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.680
Comments like this melt my fucking heart and mean the world to me.

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:08.601
And I like, just don't know the proper words to say

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:09.941
thank you. Like,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.080
it's wild that there's people that care about me and have been like,

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:17.501
kind of following my journey and are excited for me.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.520
Um,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.320
sometimes I let the hate and the ugly comments, like,

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.101
win and be louder,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.840
and I hate that, cause then I'm not really connecting with the people,

00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:28.041
the point that I'm here,

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:30.401
the point that I'm trying to do in the like this shit.

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:33.841
So I'm sorry to my friends that have followed me.

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:35.841
And then I get like distracted and off into.

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:37.981
Then I go down the rabbit holes of hate.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.720
Um, I'm here for you guys.

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:41.601
The women who see me understand,

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:42.921
they know the fucking deal.

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:44.941
I'm not making shit up, you know what I mean?

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.920
We are all like, validating each other and understanding,

00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:49.281
like, yeah,

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.061
I'm not crazy, you're not crazy.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.520
And so I'm just so thankful

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.041
for everybody that's been on this journey with me.

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:56.601
Like, so outrageously thankful.

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:58.601
And the fact that I have like,

00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:01.501
people to celebrate the shit with means the world to me.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.260
So, um,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.480
thank you truly,

00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:07.001

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:12.806
