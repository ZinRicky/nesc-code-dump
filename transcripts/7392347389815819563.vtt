WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:02.500
Today is one of those nights.

00:02.720 --> 00:07.620
We got take out again, and we couldn't decide,

00:07.720 --> 00:10.540
so we got. I. She.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.240
She couldn't decide. I couldn't decide.

00:13.241 --> 00:15.441
I could decide. I'm a Libra.

00:15.442 --> 00:18.481
That's just what I do. Look how they twisted their mind.

00:18.482 --> 00:20.741
No. Very considerate of them,

00:21.400 --> 00:22.200
Ben.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.200
What's this? Thank you.

00:24.201 --> 00:26.101
Ground pork, extra noodles,

00:27.280 --> 00:28.080
ramen.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.060
What's this? I think it's your tempura.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.800
Oh, nice.

00:36.801 --> 00:39.061
I love how everything comes separate.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.060
Very good. Are you gonna microwave?

00:42.440 --> 00:44.620
Um, most likely, yeah.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.220
This is mine. Food needs to be piping hot in order for it to be good.

00:49.280 --> 00:52.620
We're also watching house of Dragons.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.200
I've gotten lucky into it.

00:54.201 --> 00:56.181
He never watched game of Thrones.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.760
I'm obsessed with wagamamas,

00:59.761 --> 01:02.241
and they never had a Texas location.

01:02.242 --> 01:05.061
When I was pregnant and craving it so bad,

01:05.280 --> 01:10.340
I got these bao buns with eggplant and mushrooms.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.120
These are so insanely good.

01:13.121 --> 01:16.161
And then I've never had Wagamama's gyoza before,

01:16.162 --> 01:18.181
but I got some pork gyoza.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.420
Where's my broth?

01:20.400 --> 01:24.160
But it's in. But it's not brothy enough.

01:24.161 --> 01:26.161
No, they see mine.

01:26.162 --> 01:27.621
Mine came in separate.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.520
They thought about this. Wagamama.

01:30.521 --> 01:33.401
Why is there a wilted salad in my soup?

01:33.402 --> 01:35.301
This is why I cook my own food,

01:35.480 --> 01:38.480
but this is what I get. I get.

01:38.481 --> 01:39.881
I don't know which number it is,

01:39.882 --> 01:41.361
but it's two tablespoons of broth.

01:41.362 --> 01:41.801
Oh, my.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.061
How I was so excited for the broth.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.380
There's always something wrong in my.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.360
I had a feeling that that might happen.

01:48.361 --> 01:50.221
I love your little wet paper towels.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.300
So I also got us Wingstop

01:54.760 --> 01:55.400
because also

01:55.401 --> 01:58.701
I just wanted some wings to put inside what? I wanted

02:00.960 --> 02:03.420
the sauce on the side. Original, hot.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.500
What's this? Ranch.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.020
This is ranch.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.620
First of all, ranch is gross. So you're gross

02:15.560 --> 02:19.020
without seasoning? I just get lemon pepper.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.360
That is the seasoning. Well, yeah,

02:20.361 --> 02:21.841
I get them with lemon pepper seasoning,

02:21.842 --> 02:24.141
but not sauce. Also,

02:24.160 --> 02:28.220
lucky and I have just been watching skits of ourselves on TikTok.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.420
Actually hilarious. There's this one guy.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.800
What videos did you do? Yeah,

02:33.801 --> 02:35.321
an inhaler and then the.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.121
Then he did, like,

02:36.122 --> 02:38.601
a sunscreen video. Also,

02:38.602 --> 02:41.721
who's following all this drama that's going on?

02:41.722 --> 02:44.901
Cause I'm the man, you understand?

02:45.240 --> 02:47.460
This feels illegal. Hmm.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.220
Double noodle.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.180
This is what it looks like without spilling.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.460
Thank you.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.480
This feels like a really random food haul,

02:56.481 --> 03:01.606
but we're gonna go watch house of Dragons and enjoy our food.
