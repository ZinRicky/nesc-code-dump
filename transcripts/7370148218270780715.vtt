00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
Is. I love adult money.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.520
I just got these on eBay.

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:05.721
I'm literally.

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:06.601
I'm not kidding.

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:09.101
I'm pulling up to the club with this bag.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.640
No one can say anything to me.

00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:14.621
This lip gloss is from 2014,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.300
and we will be trying it on.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.420
Oh, my god.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.360
This is crazy.

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:29.761
This is crazy.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.380
let me put my lip liner on.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.940
This is my literal go to lip stain.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.220
Um, game changer, honestly.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.080
Now for the moment of truth.

00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:47.461
We're putting on the through the dark one direction lip gloss from.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.220
Haha,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.760
it's broken. Oh, no,

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.081
it's broken. That's crazy.

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.661
Oh, no.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.780
Through the dark reveal.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.260
Are you freaking serious?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.120
You need to get one of those, like,

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:10.501
Sephora samples,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.860
like, the. Let me handle this.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.220
Okay,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.200
it's fine. We're using the orange gloss,

00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:23.241
which is kiss you,

00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:24.761
and I'm gonna just steal that.

00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:25.601
Okay, it's fine.

00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:27.261
There's. There's a top to this one.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.280
I don't even care.

00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:29.701
I'm putting it in this.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.560
Figure out an issue.

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:35.381
I'll figure out how to deal with the origin later.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.660
Part 2. Trying to lip gloss.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.460
It broke the other one.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.380
What the fuck?

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.300
What is going on?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.980
I don't know how I ended up here.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.100
This is 100% what I get.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.000
You know what?

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:06.021
Let's just try the gloss.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.400
And the thing is,

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:12.341
it looks phenomenal.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.540
That is the most messed up part.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.540
Yeah, I'm using my finger. Liz,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.260
it looks so good.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.020
I need to figure out what to Do now.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.100
Wait, that's what I'm saying.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.840
Okay, 1D,

00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:39.681
which one is this?

00:02:39.682 --> 00:02:41.921
The pink one. But which?

00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:42.321
Through the dark?

00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:43.541
I think through the dark.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.820
Yeah. Work.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.820
Sign me up.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.820
Can you get me another one? Or is it girl? Yeah,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.560
hopefully the other ones functional.

00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:56.741
EWW. Girl,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.780
what am I gonna do with all those lip gloss?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.580
It's all over my hands.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.820
It is a little gritty, though.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.080
Like, you could feel the sparkles.

00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:09.341
Yeah, you could feel the sparkles.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.900
We weren't expecting any kind of

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.260
phenomenal quality lip gloss from the boys,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.920
but this is cute and I will wear it.

00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:22.401
I just have to figure out the whole applicator issue, because right now,

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:23.881
the scene on my bed.

00:03:23.882 --> 00:03:25.181
You don't wanna know.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.920
So I had gotten the little,

00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:28.601
well, nub out, and it's, like, broken,

00:03:28.602 --> 00:03:29.601
I guess, like maybe the glue.

00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:32.201
And this is literally a ten year old lip gloss,

00:03:32.202 --> 00:03:34.421
so I'll give him some Grace.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.720
Um, I took out the stopper,

00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:37.921
so I think the.

00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:40.141
What I'm gonna have to do is just like.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.940
Now it's not gonna work.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.340
That's not gonna work.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.660
I will figure something out.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.540
My little sister's trying some.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.940
This

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.460
is without lip liner.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.340
Honestly, it still looks good. Yeah.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.260
Oh,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.120
you're embarrassing me.

00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:06.281
You're embarrassing me.

00:04:06.282 --> 00:04:07.241
Hey, let's cut the tapes.

00:04:07.242 --> 00:04:08.321
Hey, let's cut the tapes.

00:04:08.322 --> 00:04:08.921
Okay, guys,

00:04:08.922 --> 00:04:10.501
let's cut the tapes.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.520
Hey, guys,

00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:13.781
uh, I'm back.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.440
How do I look? Anyway,

00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:21.221
my review is like a solid 3.4. Whoa.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.360
Out of five. Okay.

00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:24.321
Out of five. Out of five.

00:04:24.322 --> 00:04:25.401
Girl don't play.

00:04:25.402 --> 00:04:26.341
Girl don't play.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.280
Color. Definitely there.

00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:33.141
It's giving Claire's circa 2,012. Maybe,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.700
um, 2014.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.960
Okay. They were behind.

00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:36.361
They were behind.

00:04:36.362 --> 00:04:37.041
They were behind.

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:38.081
They were behind. Claire's.

00:04:38.082 --> 00:04:38.521
No, no,

00:04:38.522 --> 00:04:39.201
you're right, you're right,

00:04:39.202 --> 00:04:39.801
you're right, you're right,

00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:40.121
you're right. Uh,

00:04:40.122 --> 00:04:42.381
the sparkles. Hmm.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.300
Very textured.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.720
It's, like, gritty.

00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:47.001
Very textured.

00:04:47.002 --> 00:04:48.361
I feel like I have crumbs.

00:04:48.362 --> 00:04:49.601
Like, also,

00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:50.721
I don't know, I personally,

00:04:50.722 --> 00:04:52.521
I think it's a little bright for me.

00:04:52.522 --> 00:04:54.501
I wouldn't be able to wear it without lip liner.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.600
Oh.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.920
I also, I'm Tanner than you,

00:04:57.921 --> 00:04:59.321
and I look white in this lighting,

00:04:59.322 --> 00:05:02.901
so what are you trying to say? Um,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.140
okay.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.880
Anyways, I don't care.

00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:11.001
I will be thinking out a way to use this,

00:05:11.002 --> 00:05:12.501
but right now,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.180
a little unusable.
