00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.560
it's birthday season in my house

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:04.083
because the majority of us were born approximately 

00:00:04.084 --> 00:00:05.320
40 weeks after New Year's

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:06.574
which is suspicious 

00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:08.080
but maybe not surprising

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:10.800
and I'd love to know if this is a universal experience for mums

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.600
but no matter how much planning I seem to do

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.370
I always find myself up until about 

00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:15.600
midnight the night before

00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:17.320
baking a fkn ridiculous cake

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:18.825
and the night before Olive’s 6th 

00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:20.240
birthday party was no exception

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:21.912
because my little darling requested 

00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:24.320
a “bright pink heart shaped glittery strawberry cake”

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:26.370
which definitely is in my repertoire and 

00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:28.120
definitely didn't leave me sweating

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:29.914
I made a fluffy vanilla sponge before 

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:31.520
separating that out into two bowls

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:34.340
and using a gel baby pink food colouring to colour one half

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.480
then I layered the pink batter and the plain batter

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:37.720
and kind of swirled it with a knife

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:39.920
so hopefully we create a marble effect

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:41.120
I made two cakes like this

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:42.972
and drizzled them with a bit of simple syrup 

00:00:42.973 --> 00:00:43.920
to help keep them moist

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:45.561
before sandwiching them together with a 

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:47.120
buttercream and strawberry jam filling

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:48.400
then I crumb coated it all

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:50.280
painted my nails and called it a night

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:52.520
the next morning I got started on a pink butter the cream

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.016
and I know the hard way what that 

00:00:54.017 --> 00:00:55.160
plastic guard thing is for

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:55.800
for my mixer

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:57.683
which I definitely should have been using

00:00:57.684 --> 00:00:59.200
 and will be using moving forward

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:01.183
layered all my pink frosting before smoothing 

00:01:01.184 --> 00:01:02.520
it out with a hot dough scraper

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:04.120
and I don't have a proper turntable

00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:06.440
but what I do have is good old Kiwi ingenuity

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:10.200
so I just used a Lazy Susan that I keep my jars in in the pantry

00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:12.120
and a cake board and it worked out aces

00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:14.800
now I am far from proficient when it comes to cake decorating

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:17.880
but what I lack in talent I make out for with enthusiasm

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:20.600
I did a pretty average job on these rosettes if I'm honest

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.120
but when your target audience is a bunch of 6 year old girls

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:24.740
it doesn't really matter does it

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.040
a good sprinkle of edible glitter will hide all sins

00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:28.360
and you can't convince me otherwise

00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:30.800
Olive chose the pink glitter when we were at the shop recently

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:33.040
but then we decided it didn't really contrast well enough

00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:34.360
so we opted for a silver

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:37.190
she requested fresh cut strawberries to top it all off 

00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:38.220
and candles obviously

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.143
now cowgirl Barbie 

00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:40.960
is gonna take this cake down to the farm

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:42.840
to have a party with all her little friends

00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:44.043
is it a bit garrish? 

00:01:44.044 --> 00:01:44.960
absofuckinlutely

00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:46.075
but is she over the moon?

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:48.440
 I hope so cause I just about killed myself making it

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.864
this is how the marbling turned out 

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:51.486
and it actually tasted pretty bloody good
