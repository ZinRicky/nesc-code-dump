Banana bread is probably the thing I bake most in our house,

00:03.241 --> 00:05.641
and I had a lot of bananas that were very ripe,

00:05.642 --> 00:08.441
so I use those up to make the best banana bread.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.201
Don't throw your brown bananas away.

00:10.202 --> 00:12.201
So many ways you can use them,

00:12.202 --> 00:14.161
and they're especially good in banana bread.

00:14.162 --> 00:18.161
So I started by mashing up three to four bananas depending on the size.

00:18.162 --> 00:20.641
You can add some more cracking in an egg.

00:20.642 --> 00:23.201
Instead of sugar, I use some maple syrup,

00:23.202 --> 00:24.561
some vanilla extract,

00:24.562 --> 00:25.481
melted butter,

00:25.482 --> 00:27.561
however much cinnamon your heart desires.

00:27.562 --> 00:29.081
Give that a really good mix

00:29.082 --> 00:32.401
before adding in some baking powder and baking soda.

00:32.402 --> 00:35.161
I like this recipe because everything stays in one bowl,

00:35.162 --> 00:36.641
so less clean up.

00:36.642 --> 00:38.161
I add some flour to that,

00:38.162 --> 00:39.481
give that really good mix,

00:39.482 --> 00:44.241
and then I usually add some chocolate chips or nuts to the mixture

00:44.242 --> 00:46.441
and make sure they're incorporated really well

00:46.442 --> 00:49.081
before burning my batter into my loaf pan

00:49.082 --> 00:51.581
and popping it in the oven for about an hour.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.800
Usually I would let this cool completely in the loaf pan,

00:54.801 --> 00:56.001
but we couldn't wait today.

00:56.002 --> 00:59.461
So I cut a slice and top it with some butter.
