00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.840
so the word fat is a word describes a physical state of being

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:03.680
it's not a feeling

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:05.040
and maybe unpack why

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.680
if you were feeling bad about yourself

00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:08.840
your first word to describe that is feeling fat

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:09.520
you can feel bloated

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:10.160
you can feel ugly

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:11.080
you can feel uncomfortable

00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:12.600
your feelings about yourself

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.360
do not change the way that your physical body exists

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:19.040
if I feel thin doesn't you have become Mariah Carey skinny

00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:21.440
my feelings don't change the way that my physical body look

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:23.520
I understand having negative feelings about your body

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:24.760
I think it's important to find language

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:26.200
that actually explains what you're feeling

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:29.720
instead of relying on words like fat to describe something that is inaccurate

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:30.160
because again

00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:30.920
fat is not a feeling

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:32.894
it's literally just a descriptor of size that's it
