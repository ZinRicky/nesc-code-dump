00:00.240 --> 00:01.720
Let's get ready for a little

00:01.720 --> 00:04.360
Valentine's inspired date night at home.

00:04.360 --> 00:06.160
I love very classic,

00:06.160 --> 00:07.200
elegant pieces,

00:07.200 --> 00:08.840
not only when it comes to clothing,

00:08.840 --> 00:10.820
but also when it comes to jewelry.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.760
And I'm absolutely obsessed with Brilliant Earth

00:13.760 --> 00:15.800
and have been for the past few years.

00:15.800 --> 00:20.120
I love how all of their gold is 98% recycled and.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.760
And their diamonds are sustainably sourced,

00:22.760 --> 00:24.320
which I love.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.160
So for tonight

00:25.160 --> 00:27.220
I'm layering a few pieces,

00:27.320 --> 00:28.480
complete my look,

00:28.480 --> 00:30.680
and then I went on to cooking,

00:30.680 --> 00:32.040
which is my love language,

00:32.040 --> 00:34.343
and having a little date night.
