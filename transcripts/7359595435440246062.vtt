00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.720
I think a lot of people assume

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:03.961
that being interested in beauty and fashion is, like,

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:05.121
a vein pursuit,

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:06.421
but in reality,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.520
it has a lot more to do with energy

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.121
and your alignment with the universe than you think.

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:12.641
I'm sure you've heard the phrase look good,

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:14.321
feel good, but I think it's more than that,

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:16.941
because when you feel confident,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.960
and that doesn't mean you have to feel confident

00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.281
in something that somebody else would feel confident in.

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:25.401
But if you are dressed in a way that aligns how you feel on the inside

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:27.461
with how you present on the outside,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.400
it's almost as as if you're

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:30.821
public and private

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.620
identities are working together to maximize your power.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.640
And people can really sense that.

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.201
You know, when you look at your favorite creators

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:40.641
who have gone on a style journey

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:42.261
or a style evolution,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.840
the energy that they put out into the universe,

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:46.581
the things that come their way,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.660
the people and connections they meet become maximized.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.080
And it almost has nothing to do

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:53.601
with the type of clothes they're wearing

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:55.841
or the style that they are embodying,

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:58.561
and so much more to do with the energy shift

00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:01.581
that happens when they are dressing for their true selves.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.200
Which is why I take a tiny bit of issue with trend following,

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:10.201
because if the fashion that you're wearing doesn't align with, like,

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:11.361
your inner self,

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:13.561
it can sometimes feel like a costume.

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:17.121
Like, are you performing the role Of a fashionable person?

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:20.421
Or are you dressing in a way that makes your soul light up?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.360
Which is why I'm not anti trend.

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:25.441
I'm simply anti only dressing trendy,

00:01:25.442 --> 00:01:28.401
because I think it doesn't allow you the opportunity

00:01:28.402 --> 00:01:32.621
to align your fashion with your inner self,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.680
which is why you see so many celebrities

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:36.481
who kind of stick to a signature style.

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:39.221
Jennifer Aniston is a fabulous example of this.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.040
She embodies this, like,

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:43.781
relaxed California cool girl aesthetic,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.880
and she seems like that person.

00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:47.401
It's a good fit.

00:01:47.402 --> 00:01:51.521
So as much as a style journey can be about simply outward aesthetics,

00:01:51.522 --> 00:01:54.561
it's also about harmonizing your inner self.

00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:55.941
So in some ways,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.700
finding your personal style

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.220
may turn out to be one of the least shallow things you do,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.500
because it is kind of that deep.
