You know what sounds really good after a long day?

00:02.961 --> 00:06.841
Some wings. I don't wash my chicken because you genuinely don't have to,

00:06.842 --> 00:08.741
but you can do as you please.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.120
This is what I make when I want a quick dinner.

00:11.121 --> 00:13.041
I started by seasoning my wings,

00:13.042 --> 00:15.201
adding some baking powder to my seasoning,

00:15.202 --> 00:17.281
and then popping them on a wire rack.

00:17.282 --> 00:19.401
While those were baking for about an hour,

00:19.402 --> 00:21.521
I started on my chimichurri.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.681
They were making chimichurri wings.

00:23.682 --> 00:26.801
I've been thinking about this combination for about a week now,

00:26.802 --> 00:29.601
so finally I'm coming around to recipe testing it.

00:29.602 --> 00:30.961
I chopped up some parsley,

00:30.962 --> 00:32.321
cilantro, shallot,

00:32.322 --> 00:34.321
some capers, grated some garlic,

00:34.322 --> 00:37.061
some chili, and then seasoned my chimichurri.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.920
Made sure to give it a really good mix.

00:38.921 --> 00:42.041
I also added some Korean red pepper flakes to it.

00:42.042 --> 00:46.121
After about 30 minutes, I flip my wings and pop them back in the oven.

00:46.122 --> 00:49.761
I always like making some type of slaw to go alongside my wings.

00:49.762 --> 00:52.041
Something creamy but not too heavy.

00:52.042 --> 00:54.161
We shredded some cabbage carrots.

00:54.162 --> 00:56.321
I added my tangy dressing on top

00:56.322 --> 00:57.241
and set that aside

00:57.242 --> 01:00.281
and got started mixing my wings with the chimichurri.

01:00.282 --> 01:01.841
Once all my wings were coated,

01:01.842 --> 01:04.601
I topped it with a light layer of Parmesan cheese

01:04.602 --> 01:06.387
and these were absolutely divine.
