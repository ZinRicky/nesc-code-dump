00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
Even fucking do.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.860
How so? A piece of shit guy that used to be my roommate.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.240
Things really fell apart. His father died

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:18.041
and then he like lost his fucking mind.

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:20.241
And then I feel like he needed somebody to be angry at,

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:21.521
and that was gonna be me.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:24.361
So he started like using all my shit in the house and not replacing it.

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:25.081
And I was like, hey bro,

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:26.401
I get that your dad died, but like,

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:27.641
I'm a single mom to 4 kids.

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:29.121
You can't just like use up all my food,

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:32.201
use up all my shit, make a big fucking mess and like leave it for me.

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:34.301
You gotta fucking be a little bit respectful.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.040
That's when everything started to deteriorate.

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:36.681
So I was like, alright, cool.

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.381
When the lease is over, we're just gonna part ways.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.000
We parted ways and he was like, um.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:42.761
I was like, I'm gonna.

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:45.001
He's like, get out as soon as you can cause my friends wanna move in.

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:45.641
I was like, cool,

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:47.681
got it. So I left,

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:48.481
you know, early.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.441
I left two weeks early. And I was like, hey,

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:52.361
I'm gonna pay the portion of rent that I'm here

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:53.041
and then I'm gonna leave

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:54.601
you and your friends will take care of the rest.

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:55.481
He was like, yep, cool,

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:57.061
got it. I was like, cool,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.640
I moved. And then he was like,

00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:59.361
you didn't pay all the rent.

00:00:59.362 --> 00:01:00.121
And I was like, yeah, bitch,

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:01.041
I'm paying a pro rated Rate?

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:02.081
I'm not gonna pay for the whole month.

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:03.201
So you and your friend, like,

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:07.361
trying to fucking constantly get me to pay for,

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:08.001
you know what I mean? Like,

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:09.281
wanting to live off of me,

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:14.541
wanting to use me. So since I only paid my pro rated portion,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.080
the landlord was like, hey,

00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:17.401
you know, you guys gotta pay the fucking rent.

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:19.181
And he was like, why isn't she paid?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.080
He started, like,

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:22.021
making a big fuss, and I was like, Bud,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.400
I have the fucking text message where I said

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:26.881
I'm gonna pay the perverted rate

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:28.161
where you're asking me to leave early.

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:29.461
And everything was cool,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.240
and then all of a sudden he has a problem with it.

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:32.161
And I'm like, wow,

00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:34.361
that sucks to suck, because I literally have it in writing.

00:01:34.362 --> 00:01:35.881
You can't fucking do anything,

00:01:35.882 --> 00:01:38.441
and I'm not gonna fucking pay the whole month rent

00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:40.321
so you and your friends could live here alone.

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:42.321
Like, tell me how fucking alpha you are

00:01:42.322 --> 00:01:44.581
that you want the woman to fucking pay for everything.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.920
So I'm like, no,

00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:47.301
that's not how it works.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.480
So then what happens? My car first,

00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:51.881
it was just the driver side window

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:53.041
and the driver side, like,

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:54.721
tail light got smashed. And I was like,

00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:56.041
whatever, you fucking idiot,

00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:58.481
I'll fix it. Well,

00:01:58.482 --> 00:02:00.401
the kid that I babysit lives across the street,

00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:02.541
and I have to drop him off at home sometimes,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.940
and this motherfucker was outside and was like,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.120
talking Shit to me the other day.

00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:08.521
And I was like, whatever.

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:09.541
And drove by.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.680
So stay the fuck away from those alpha men who, um,

00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:19.581
you know, think that they're,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.360
you know, that is where it should be.

00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:23.361
Man is the man, and the woman is the woman,

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:24.001
blah, blah, blah.

00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:25.361
Because when they get mad,

00:02:25.362 --> 00:02:26.781
when they get angry,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.680
they use their strength and power to hurt the woman.

00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:32.041
And it doesn't matter how good you play along with them,

00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:33.981
it doesn't matter how much you, like,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.200
you know, try to appease them and be a good girl.

00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:37.641
When they fucking get pissed,

00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:38.721
they know that they're bigger,

00:02:38.722 --> 00:02:40.961
they're stronger, and they could do what they want to you.

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:43.161
So just stay the fuck away from those types of men.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:47.361
Stay the fuck away. I would so much rather have a fucking bear

00:02:47.362 --> 00:02:49.021
than a fucking piece of shit.
