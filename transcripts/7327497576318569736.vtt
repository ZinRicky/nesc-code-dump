00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.200
I'm back because it's an emergency - Greta Gerwig 

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:09.221
and Margot Robbie have both been overlooked in the nominations for the Oscars

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.680
this is the highest grossing film of the year that we're talking about

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:20.561
this is the film that the Oscars nominated for Best Picture

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.661
so I don't understand

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.720
I like call me crazy

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:25.241
I don't know

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:26.521
I don't understand how this works

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:28.121
but I would have thought

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:32.061
if something was good enough to be nominated for Best Picture

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.840
that the director would also be nominated because they directed the best picture

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.141
so I'm Doctor Zoe

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.460
I'm eating my lunch

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.680
I have a PhD in digital feminist activism

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:47.021
I make accessible

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.740
feminist content for people who wish to further their feminist identities

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.700
and I'm really angry

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.560
I'm really angry about this

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:57.281
because don't you think the Oscars

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:58.321
like the Academy

00:00:58.322 --> 00:00:58.961
whatever they called

00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:00.501
should be embarrassed

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.860
like embarrassed that they have so poetically

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.900
made the point that the Barbie movie was already trying to make

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.900
if you think of such a good point to make

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.720
why would you nominate the director who directed it

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.341
the actor who started at Margot Robbie

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.800
no no no you're just gonna go and nominate the man

00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:26.061
as if to make the point that women are constantly overlooked

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.940
we have to work twice as hard to get the same recognition that men do

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.480
and our interest is sidelined consistently by the patriarchy

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:35.881
if that's the point you want to make

00:01:35.882 --> 00:01:36.561
you've made it

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:37.321
but guess what

00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:40.941
the film that you neglected to nominate properly already made it

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.420
so aren't you embarrassed

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.140
these people are supposed to have their finger on the pulse okay

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.940
well the pulse is saying that Barbie was a milestone movie

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.020
it was a milestone film

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.220
good films are made all the time

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.220
but Barbie is one of those films that will go down in history

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.380
was it an flawless academic execution of feminism as a whole no

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.100
but was it a very important cultural milestone that reappropriated

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.080
a doll that has often you know

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:26.141
been used as an idea to oppress us

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.360
revolutionise that idea and turn it in something that can empower us

00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.961
and started so many important conversations

00:02:32.962 --> 00:02:35.541
made feminism very accessible

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.620
and made a statement that we're here and we're fucking tired and we're over it

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.600
and it made all of these kind of feminist points very

00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:50.561
very well flawlessly and an aesthetically pleasing way

00:02:50.562 --> 00:02:52.341
it was a beautiful film

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.300
it was extremely well executed

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.900
it was funny and it was poignant

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.380
and it was a culturally important moment how how

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.200
can this be overlooked in this way

00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:10.181
I do not understand

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.860
I do do they not know things like do they not understand what's happened

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.220
do they not understand what's happening in society right now

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.180
or do they understand it all too well and they're afraid of it

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.700
and they're afraid of us
