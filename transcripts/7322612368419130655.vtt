00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.720
So I'm actually just waiting for my husband

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.480
to come back from being inside the grocery store.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.920
So what do I mean by Protection?

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.000
About the patriarchy?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.720
So, biblical patriarchy.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.560
I mean, my husband is my protector

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.920
number one. Um,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.040
both physically,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.160
which. There has been situations before we were married

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.740
that my husband physically protected me from other men.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.840
Um, not that anything transpired or was crazy,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.120
but, um, that.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.560
That definitely was a thing.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.760
Um, my husband protects me emotionally and spiritually.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.720
He is able to correct me if I need corrected

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.880
in a gentle and in loving way.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.920
My elders of my church protect me.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.000
Um, if the. Were supposed to happen.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.280
We can play the what if game all day long.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.120
But in this case,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.040
let's say my husband leaves me.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.120
Um, my church

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.400
and my elders can hold him accountable for that

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.040
because he has also made membership vows to our church

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.800
and to. To become, um,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.160
under the discipline of our church

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
if need be. And also,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.960
I know for a fact that my elders

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.000
and the people of my church

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.680
would step up and be of a help to me in that time

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.120
if that was ever to happen,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.900
which it's most likely not.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.920
But you can play the what if game all day long.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.040
And as a matter of fact,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.300
is that no one.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.000
No one is safe from the harshness, um,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.500
of life and the.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.240
The trials that life can bring.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.200
No one is safe from that.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.640
Not a woman who stays home

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.420
and not a woman who has a career.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.880
I'd also like to add that I think it's misogynistic

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.920
to think that, um,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.920
someone who's a homemaker

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.020
or someone who is a traditional wife.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.820
Is not capable of figuring something out.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.400
Or not capable of providing men for her family.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.211
If that situation must ever happen.
