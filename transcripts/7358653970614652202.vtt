00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.960
by now you've probably heard that the Arizona Supreme Court ruled

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:05.361
that the state of Arizona

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:07.641
can enforce a total abortion ban

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:11.261
that dates back to 1864

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.620
let me be clear

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.080
Arizona Republicans want to force all pregnant women

00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:21.121
to non consensually carry their pregnancies to term

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:25.121
at the risk of their own health and life

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:29.821
by relying on a law that was enacted solely by men

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.800
at a time when women could not vote or participate in government

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:37.941
and the Arizona Supreme Court just gave them the green light to do so

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.060
let's talk about how we got here

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.200
in 1864 the Arizona Legislature enacted this total abortion ban

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:47.321
and it was enacted largely because of William Jones

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:51.981
who was a pedophile notorious for forcing children to marry him

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.960
including a 12

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:57.401
14 and 15 year old girl who he then forced to bear his children

00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:00.401
so you can see why it was important to Jones and other men at the time

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:03.101
to be able to legally control women's reproduction

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.080
in 1971 Planned Parenthood sued the Arizona attorney general

00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:09.941
arguing that this abortion law was unconstitutional

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.720
but then two years later in 1973

00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:15.161
while this litigation is still going on

00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:17.321
the US Supreme Court decides Roe v

00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:19.901
Wade and makes abortion a constitutional right

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.480
so in the middle of this litigation

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.961
the Arizona courts like well

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:24.281
the United States Supreme Court

00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:27.521
just said that abortion is a constitutional rate under Roe v Wade

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:32.481
so yeah obviously now the Arizona law is clearly unconstitutional

00:01:32.482 --> 00:01:34.561
so the Arizona court says yep

00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:38.441
the 1864 law is clearly unconstitutional under Roe v

00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:40.761
Wade and they enact a permanent injunction

00:01:40.762 --> 00:01:42.101
just meaning hey

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.340
nobody is allowed to enforce this 1864 law

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.360
but then in 2022

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:49.481
the US Supreme Court overturns Roe v

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:50.801
Wade in Dobbs v

00:01:50.802 --> 00:01:52.201
Jackson Women's Health

00:01:52.202 --> 00:01:55.281
so then Arizona's attorney general the time Mark Brnovich

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.321
goes to the Arizona court and he's like hey

00:01:57.322 --> 00:01:59.961
you should lift that permanent injunction because now Roe v

00:01:59.962 --> 00:02:00.841
Wade's overturned

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:03.601
and I wanna start enforcing that 1864 law

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:06.761
Planned Parenthood opposes Mark's motion on a number of legal grounds

00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:10.981
and that litigation went on for nearly two years until last week

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.760
when the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the 1864 law can go into effect

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.281
meaning that over 3 million women in Arizona

00:02:20.282 --> 00:02:23.281
will have no choice over their pregnancies

00:02:23.282 --> 00:02:29.061
because of a law that was enacted over 160 years ago solely by men

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.940
and who kidnapped and tortured us

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.640
now the law provides an exception for when a woman's life is in danger

00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:39.921
and I put exceptions in ear quotes because these exceptions aren't real

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:43.641
there is litigation going on throughout the country because people

00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:45.161
including physicians

00:02:45.162 --> 00:02:46.201
have no idea

00:02:46.202 --> 00:02:51.261
when a woman is sick enough to avail herself of one of these exceptions

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.000
the Legislature hasn't enacted some type of standard saying

00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:55.681
this is when you can intervene

00:02:55.682 --> 00:02:57.161
and even if they tried to

00:02:57.162 --> 00:02:58.361
it's impossible

00:02:58.362 --> 00:03:02.801
every person's pregnancy and health and situation is different

00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:04.921
there's no workable standard for everyone

00:03:04.922 --> 00:03:07.841
ruling will also have a devastating impact on reproductive refugees

00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:10.321
because now New Mexico and California

00:03:10.322 --> 00:03:14.001
are the only southern states on the border that have access to abortion

00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:16.921
so not only can people no longer flee to Arizona

00:03:16.922 --> 00:03:20.441
but we also have women fleeing out of Arizona now

00:03:20.442 --> 00:03:23.921
and it's incredibly difficult for states like New Mexico and California

00:03:23.922 --> 00:03:27.081
to continue absorbing all of these reproductive refugees

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:28.841
from anti choice locations

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:31.721
while also caring for their own citizens

00:03:31.722 --> 00:03:33.061
okay let's pause there

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.480
did this help you understand what's going on in Arizona

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.041
um let me know your questions

00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:37.721

00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:40.475
and please donate to your local abortion fund
