00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.120
Every year, I hatch so many chicks.

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:03.481
Hundreds and hundreds of chicks.

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:05.681
One of my favorites of the year is chick action season.

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:08.001
I'm gonna get my incubators from the feed store across this one

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:08.441
TikTok show.

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:12.401
The design is similar to the other 3 60 incubator that I have.

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:13.041
There's a few tweaks.

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.481
I prefer. This one has the turning motor on the top,

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.481
whereas my other one has a turning motor on the bottom.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:20.361
So that means I can completely submerge this one for cleaning. Checks.

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:23.561
You know how disgusting it gets inside after they hatch,

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:24.321
you get a little fuzzy.

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:26.441
I'm really looking forward to be able to completely submerge this

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:27.981
and sanitize them completely.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.920
Looking forward to see how this system works out.

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:34.601
Other than the other 3 60 incubator, has, like,

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:35.241
water channels,

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:35.881
and they're really,

00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:36.761
really hard to clean.

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.681
This has an opens inside,

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:41.761
so I think that's gonna be another plus for your instruction manual.

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:43.461
Told you exactly how to set everything up.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.360
Hatch these eggs on as part of a school project,

00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:48.081
and this little calendar is gonna be perfect

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:50.441
to help us track when the eggs are gonna hatch.

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:50.921
Think about it.

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.681
Comes with simple instructions. When you turn it on,

00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:55.321
it's on the pre set settings to hatch tricks,

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:57.681
which is easy if you haven't hatched before,

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:58.721
so you don't have to mess around.

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:01.141
But there's some simple instructions here until you adjust.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.720
This model also comes with an automatic Egg Turner.

00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:06.781
Press the. The plus button right here to test your egg Turner.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.920
Also comes with a super convenient egg candle,

00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:10.201
so I don't have to be hunting around

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.381
trying to find a flashlight when I wanna candle my eggs.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.720
This one's actually got a really heavy bloom on it,

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:15.561
so it's hard to see.

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:16.201
And it's so bright.

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:17.441
So when you wanna candle your eggs,

00:01:17.442 --> 00:01:18.761
you do wanna turn your lights off.

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:20.961
And it's super bright here in the sunroom right now,

00:01:20.962 --> 00:01:22.241
so I'll do this in the dark.

00:01:22.242 --> 00:01:24.041
This incubator holds 22 eggs,

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.241
and I might even be doing some egg stack in this season.

00:01:26.242 --> 00:01:27.281
So follow along to see that.

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:29.561
To see how many eggs I can get to hatch in this incubator.
