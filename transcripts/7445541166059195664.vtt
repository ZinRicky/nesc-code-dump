00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
entertaining season might be upon us

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.373
but I think casual cravings 

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:04.403
and late night bites 

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:05.680
are appropriate year round

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:07.240
now I've got nine Huntly and Palmers

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.360
cracker combos that you might wanna save for later

00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:11.560
for whatever occasion it is that you're catering for

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.360
For casual cravings on the Baked Sourdough

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:15.200
which is made was real sourdough culture

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:15.640
by the way 

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:16.720
you might wanna try Marmite

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:18.520
smashed avocado and chilli flakes

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:20.875
Caramelised Onion Flatbread lends itself to a 

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:22.360
simple hummus and tomato medley 

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:24.040
and you can have the Sprouted Rye cracker bread

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:24.915
whole or quartered 

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:27.080
and I've topped mine with basil pesto and brie 

00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:28.640
now imagine you've got some people over

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:29.883
and you want them to think that you're 

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:30.840
classier than you actually are

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.320
which is something I do quite often

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:34.640
you might offer them some Baked Sourdough with pesto

00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:36.880
Pear, rocket, Gruyère and balsamic glaze

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:39.160
maybe some heirloom tomatoes topped with burrata

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:41.200
fresh basil and balsamic glaze again

00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:42.560
because I really can't fault it

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.350
maybe a small bite on the Sprouted Rye 

00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:45.360
with some whipped feta

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.000
caramelised onion honey and fresh thyme

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:48.520
might be more your cup of tea

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:49.440
and I don't know about you

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:51.454
but I find my cracker cravings hit me when 

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:52.720
I probably should be asleep

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:53.920
just trust me on this one

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:54.880
but almond butter

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:58.120
thin slices of apple and cinnamon is the perfect late night treat

00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:00.400
maybe you want something a bit sweeter with cream cheese

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:02.380
Berry coulis and shaved dark chocolate

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.105
Or - and this one feels much fancier 

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:04.960
than it actually is

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:06.680
but mascarpone, honey and thyme

00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:08.520
It’s mostly sweet with a subtle salt

00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:09.912
and it's quick and delicious 

00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:12.480
now I'm curious if I was gonna offer you any of these

00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:13.600
which plate are you choosing?

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:15.471
cause I think the Huntley & Palmer's range 

00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:16.734
is perfect for every occasion
