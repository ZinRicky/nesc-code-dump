00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.280
okay so you know how they always do

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:03.960
like a before and after of the presidents at

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:06.760
like at the beginning of their term and at the end

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:08.480
because they've always aged a lot and like

00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:11.780
look so different because the job is just worn them down

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.860
I feel like I need to make sure to be doing a before and after of me

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.040
for the next four years of this administration

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.380
because we it hasn't even started

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.680
and I've aged significantly in the last week

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:32.120
this headline alone has aged me

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:35.440
this is what you guys are gonna see in four years

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:39.960
I'm gonna be like they used to do press conferences at the White House

00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:42.780
and not just with Fox News

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.600
they would do them with all of the different news channels

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:50.760
even the ones that were a bit hard on them

00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:52.560
used to have federal agencies

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.000
there used to be a department of education

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:59.200
you used to not be able to profit off the presidency

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:03.760
you know Jimmy Carter even sold his peanut farm anyways

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:07.246
I hate it here it's been the longest week of my life
