00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.960
So one of my goals for 2024 is less impulse shopping.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.640
So instead of shopping less,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.960
we're shopping bigger,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.080
which simply means investing in higher quality pieces,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.820
but a whole lot less of them.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.040
And really trying to, like,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.360
fill gaps in my wardrobe

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.560
that I want to purposefully fill,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.820
as opposed to just

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.640
impulse buying something because it looks cute.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.040
Because, like,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.200
a lot of stuff looks cute.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.080
So here is my little shopping vision board.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.980
Um, I've got this polka dot dress from

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.320
the Pretty Dress Company.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.200
It's on pre order.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.840
I've actually already pre ordered this,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.120
and I'm really excited about it

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.000
because I need a black and white dress.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.960
I love a polka dot,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.300
and I love this company.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.000
Also have this dress by Mila.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.880
Mila, I think is the name of the brand.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.920
Here's a close up of it.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.640
The silhouette,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.760
the color, the shape.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.320
I. Ugh, love it.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.560
I have been wanting to get a vintage

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.240
Lily Anne coat forever,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.800
either in a style like this with, like,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.480
the fur at the top,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.120
or the classic,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.400
like, dress coat.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.600
If you're a vintage collector,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.940
these are like creme de LA creme.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.080
Also currently obsessed with this handbag,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.171
and I'm wearing the perfect headband for it.
