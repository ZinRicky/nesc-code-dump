00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.360
My husband requested Biria for dinner,

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:04.521
which is one of his favorite Mexican dishes,

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:05.801
so I got started immediately.

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:06.321
That morning,

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:09.521
I started by searing my pasteurised beef roast on all sides

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:11.721
and used the fat trimming to make tallow.

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:13.481
Meanwhile, I made my chili sauce.

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:15.761
A variety of guajillo and California peppers,

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:17.581
onions, and garlic cooked in water

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.560
and then blended with lots of herbs like cloves,

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.801
cumin, and oregano.

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:23.361
After removing the pepper tips and creating my sauce,

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:24.881
I poured it into the browned meat

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:26.921
and strained out the seeds and any other particles

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:28.461
for a super smooth product.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.640
This simmered all afternoon along with my beans,

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:31.921
which I cooked in bone broth.

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:34.041
Next, I started by making my masa,

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:34.361
first

00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:37.281
by washing the corn I had cooked the night before and watering cal,

00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:40.041
then using a Molino to grind into a chunky masa,

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.301
and lastly a matate for smooth masa.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.640
Making tortillas without a tortilla press has been on my list of goals,

00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:47.121
and I have finally accomplished it.

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:48.721
After five hours on the stove top,

00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:50.681
my meat was soft and easily shreddable.

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:53.361
While my husband and children patiently waited at the table,

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:56.361
I constructed the birria tacos with chopped onion, lettuce,

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:58.307
raw cheese, and homemade raw sour cream.
