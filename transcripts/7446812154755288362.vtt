00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.720
2 to 3! Such a fun age,

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:02.921
but they are super busy.

00:00:02.922 --> 00:00:06.301
So here's my suggestion for gifts for kids ages 2 to 3.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.680
My favorite idea for family to give to you is memberships to aquariums,

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:12.801
the little gym, children's museum.

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:15.181
Stuff to get you out of the house and keep your kid active.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.960
Next I would start saving your boxes and food items and let them play

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:21.921
grocery store. You've already bought the item,

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:23.081
you just don't throw it away.

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:24.641
Pack it up with tape, make sure it's clean,

00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:27.581
and give them maybe a basket to throw stuff in and play grocery store.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.640
Along the same lines,

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:30.641
this is a great time to start introducing care tasks.

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:32.941
So this cute little Dyson vacuum.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.080
It's about $24.

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:37.501
It actually sucks stuff up and it's a great gift for two year olds.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.900
They would also get a kick out of a feather duster

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.140
and a family favorite of my house.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.800
Solo cups and balls.

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:48.181
You can get fun colored balls like this and the games are endless.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.120
We also like doing fun bath time stuff.

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:52.381
So bath paint huge.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.980
Also big packs of glow sticks,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.039
disco bath and all sorts of pouring stuff. Hope this helps!
