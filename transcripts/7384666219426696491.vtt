00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
Poor women who cook have healthier diets than wealthy women who don't.

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.121
Rates of home cooking decline,

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:10.281
rates of obesity go up. And then you have the industry

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:13.681
with marketing messages that are flattering our sense of business

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.181
and pleasantly telling us,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.840
you don't have time to cook,

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.881
you're too important, you're a loser if you have time to cook.

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:24.121
So I do tell the story of how we came to this,

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:27.501
how a culture of home cooking was dismantled,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.040
deliberately dismantled, by the food industry,

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:33.121
which took out billboards in the early 70s across America

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:34.921
with a giant bucket of fried chicken,

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:35.241
you know,

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:39.741
the red thing with the 14 pieces of chicken popping out of the top,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.300
and just a two word slogan,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.520
women's liberation is very,

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:48.381
very clever, because they redefined not cooking,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.120
which was kind of in distribute before this,

00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:52.721
as the progressive thing to do.

00:00:52.722 --> 00:00:54.721
And men grabbed at this and women grabbed at this

00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:56.961
because it essentially solved a problem

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:58.841
once again. Create an anxiety,

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:01.730
solve a problem. And women who weren't working also there
