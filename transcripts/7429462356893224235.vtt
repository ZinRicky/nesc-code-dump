00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.480
The white fragility of weirdos

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:02.321
propagating the lie

00:00:02.322 --> 00:00:04.161
that immigrants are to blame for the housing shortage

00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:05.841
is repugnant. If you don't know me,

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:07.441
my name is Raven, and as a black Jew,

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:09.401
I understand scapegoating when I see it.

00:00:09.402 --> 00:00:12.001
Here's the formula. Instead of naming what the actual problem is,

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:13.481
which is a lack of affordable housing,

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:15.201
the scapegoat is always to blame.

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:17.421
In this case, the scapegoat is folks were immigrants.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.240
Black folks are always a scapegoat for crime,

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:22.221
and therefore that makes it permissible to overpolice our communities.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.960
Similarly,

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:25.881
Jewish folks became the scapegoats during 1930s and 40s Germany

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:27.361
for the economic woes of the nation,

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:29.621
and therefore we had to be mass annihilated.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.680
Is it starting to click?

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:32.361
The thing that strikes me about white supremacy

00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:34.761
is how fundamentally unimaginative it is

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:36.841
to regurgitate the same methodology of hatred

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:39.241
over and over again. It's really quite pitiful.

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:42.870
I almost feel bad for people who operate this way. Almost.
