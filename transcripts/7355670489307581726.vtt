00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.080
My kids aren't picky eaters at all,

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:03.361
but they do love chicken,

00:00:03.362 --> 00:00:06.601
so I decided to make them one of their favorite meals for dinner,

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:07.361
roast chicken.

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:09.201
I wasn't about to make a grocery trip,

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:11.401
so to elevate this simple go to meal,

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:13.921
I decided to make some homemade sourdough croutons

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:16.881
with the cabbage and dipping I had chopped a few days before

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.841
when the salad and dressing were prepped.

00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:20.201
I pop the salad back in the

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.761
fridge to make sure it would be cold and crisp when I serve it,

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:24.521
since my husband loves it like that.

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:27.921
I then got started with the croutons by chopping a several day old

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:30.121
sourdough sandwich bread loaf into

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:31.321
1 to 2 inch cubes

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.601
and topping them with olive oil,

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:34.161
salt, thyme, and oregano.

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:36.041
There's for about 20 minutes

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:37.841
and then I finished by slicing the chicken,

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:39.561
which literally was falling off the bone

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:41.241
because it had been slow cooked all day.

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:43.641
I reserved the nutrient rich broth for soups and cooking.

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:44.521
Grains are like yams.

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:46.681
While my family waited at the dinner table,

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:50.201
I toss the salad with hot croutons and a pineapple vinaigrette

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:50.881
and serve dinner

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.441
with a side of purple sauerkraut

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:54.761
that I'd allowed to ferment for about one month.

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:57.221
This dinner was easy and very delicious.
