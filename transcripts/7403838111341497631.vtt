00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
It's really fucking shitty that women are surmising that

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:07.101
the reason why Ballerina Farm dropped out of Juilliard

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.480
in her senior year. She was like,

00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:10.281
well, she knew she wasn't gonna be a good ballerina anyway,

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:11.081
so she was like, fuck it,

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:13.181
I'll just give up my dreams and go with this rich guy.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.280
What kind of pick me anti woman shit is that?

00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:21.201
And for your fucking information,

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:24.341
for the first few months in the same fucking article,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.520
for the first few months after their marriage,

00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:30.081
she still tried dancing. She was a professional dancer in Brazil

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:31.961
for the first few months of their life.

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:33.721
She was not trying to give up on her dream.

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:35.381
No, the fuck she wasn't.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.160
She was absolutely fucking convinced.

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:39.801
It's called fucking love bombing

00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:42.121
when you go from just having met

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:44.781
to being married within a few months of each other.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.480
Wake the fuck up! Come on!

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.641
Just because you have a choice to do something

00:00:50.642 --> 00:00:52.761
doesn't make it a good fucking choice.

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:57.201
Just because a guy is offering to give you this grand,

00:00:57.202 --> 00:01:00.661
amazing fucking life, all you have to do in exchange is be his partner.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.760
I mean, that seems like a big fucking exchange.

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.401
It seems like. It seems like it's maybe,

00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:08.461
possibly too fucking good to be true.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.200
And he's not gonna give you that fucking life.

00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:12.881
When you're hoping for the trip to Greece,

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:15.021
you're gonna get a fucking egg apron.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.200
Don't fall for, like,

00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:19.801
if you wanna Get dressed up pretty and bake shit.

00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:23.041
You can do that. And then you get to eat the shit

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:24.481
instead of giving it all to some man

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:26.781
who's never gonna fucking fully appreciate

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.960
all that you're giving to them.

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:32.001
You don't have. It's not a this or that.

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:35.841
You can be pretty and bake and do all kinds of shit.

00:01:35.842 --> 00:01:39.341
You don't need to be somebody's fucking little personal servant.
