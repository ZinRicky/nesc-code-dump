00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.360
Let's talk about kids with sensory issues,

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:03.821
why they're not just misbehaving.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.980
So for my daughter, her triggers are textures and clothes.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.200
And I had similar issues growing up,

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:12.241
but we just didn't really know what it was.

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:13.681
And this is bigger than just

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:16.301
her not wanting to wear certain type of clothing.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.540
It's her body actually can't stand the way it feels.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.720
For me, when I was a kid,

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:24.201
it was so bad that even if I was naked right out of the shower,

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:28.141
I still wanted to claw my skin off cause I was so uncomfortable.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.100
To put it in perspective,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.320
imagine you're in a straight jacket full of sand

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:36.101
and the person who put you in that straight jacket tells you,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.780
stop misbehaving, just deal with it.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.220
You would feel unheard, crazy,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.700
uncomfortable and desperate.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.820
And that's what these kids are experiencing.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.960
Her brain isn't processing these tactile stimulations in a correct way.

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:52.741
And she's not doing it on purpose.
