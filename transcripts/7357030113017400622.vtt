00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.960
as a woman I feel safe when men are acknowledging their mistakes

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:05.321
not when they're minimizing them

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:06.441
your story is so unique

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:09.241
but it's also an experience that a lot of men can relate to

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:12.481
where you were victim and you were perpetrator

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:14.581
I mean we all under patriarchy

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.200
that's pretty much the deal for men right

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:18.361
you're hurt by patriarchy

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:22.041
you're hurt by men who exploit your weaknesses or your vulnerability

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:24.561
then you're taught to not have any vulnerability

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:27.961
and so then you end up taking it out in your romantic relationship

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:29.321
do you feel that dichotomy

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:31.041
you know of being victim and

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:31.761
and perpetrator

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:34.241
is that hard to fathom

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:37.961
and then how do you approach that as a man in our society

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:41.141
yeah I think that that's comes back to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.920
seeing seeing myself act in certain ways and

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:51.021
and make choices that um

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.480
I feel are so out of character for myself and not who I wanna be

00:00:58.481 --> 00:01:01.161
and not who I wanna be in the future

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:03.141
you you can't minimize

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.540
um who you've hurt and

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.440
and the actions you've taken

00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:11.021
you I have to take accountability for

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.340
for the choices that I've made and make amends as well

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.360
I just know that when I make those choices

00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:19.001
that's not who I am

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:25.695
I wanna find out what it is and how I can change
