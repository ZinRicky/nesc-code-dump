00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.580
So I just moved in and my bedroom is in the basement.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.640
And when we first moved in,

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:08.661
we saw that pole there, and I was like, hmm,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.940
that looks interesting. I wonder what the fuck.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.080
There's like a water pipe thing in my bedroom.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.321
So I'm like, hm,

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:18.841
renters insurance is probably,

00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:20.881
probably gonna be on the list of things to get.

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:24.581
Cause what if that fucking paint burst in my bedroom with all my shit?

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.020
Guess what fucking happened yesterday,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.520
literally as I was trying to take the kid.

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.261
I babysit a kid for the summer.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.680
His mother is blind and his father is blind,

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:38.381
so it's not like they could just come pick him up.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.240
So his mom's like, hey,

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:40.521
we're home. Can you bring my kid home?

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:41.741
And I'm like, got you.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.800
And then I hear, like,

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:44.541
a fucking waterfall. And I'm like,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.600
there's nothing running. We don't have the washing machine,

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:48.361
we don't have the dishwashers not on.

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:49.161
Like, what the fuck?

00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:54.221
And I go downstairs and I see a fucking waterfall pouring onto. Oh.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.440
Of, like,

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.621
memories under my sonogram pictures.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.900
Fucking my boyfriend's, all his computer shit.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.140
I was like, oh my god.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.520
Turned it off, went outside,

00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.281
the guy, there was somebody,

00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:07.961
like, doing, like,

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:09.941
yard work on our hose or whatever.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.400
And he came in, thank god.

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:13.841
He was like the nicest person on the planet.

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:14.321
I told him

00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:16.521
the only good thing that came from this was a restored faith.

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:18.081
In humanity. Cause that man,

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:19.921
if I had to pick between bear and man,

00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:21.421
that man, I would pick him.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.620
Oh, god.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.480
So, um.

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:27.701
It was a bit of a fucking stressful night.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.500
Made me kind of hate living here a little bit.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.680
And. Yeah,

00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:33.561
they told me that the repair man was.

00:01:33.562 --> 00:01:36.041
I was first on his list, and he just called me.

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:37.401
He's like, I'll be there around 2:00.

00:01:37.402 --> 00:01:38.081
I was like, okay,

00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:39.001
that's great. Yeah,

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:40.741
you're. You're great. So

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.140
thankfully,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.720
I'm the only one that stressed about this.

00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:47.521
My boyfriend's like, it's okay.

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:50.181
My kids are like, we're home with mommy, so.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.840
But that's a little update on moving in.

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:54.861
It's been stressful as fuck.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.300
And that water thing really. It really upset me.
