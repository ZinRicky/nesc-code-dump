00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.920
Here's everything I make in a morning.

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:04.721
As someone who was just in Europe for the past three weeks

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:06.241
and wants to get back on track,

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:08.761
I start by making a fresh batch of coconut milk

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:11.041
so I can swap a coffee for a matcha latte.

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:13.681
I over indulged in coffee and heavy cream while away

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.801
and am definitely feeling the damage.

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:17.241
After feeding my sleepy

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:20.081
sourdough starter with some freshly milled flour and water,

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:22.001
I get to making the children breakfast

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.481
with the abundance of eggs my chickens have provided me

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.401
well away to make these egg cupcakes,

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:27.721
I combine eight eggs,

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:29.201
some raw cream, and salt.

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:30.201
I save the eggshells

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:33.541
which I throw to my backyard chickens for added Calcium and nutrition.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.080
I then grease a muffin pan and layer shredded

00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.421
pasture raised chicken Parmigiano Reggiano in the egg mix.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.600
Those bake in the oven for just 15 minutes

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:43.541
and taste absolutely delicious.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.880
The kids love these so much, so we make them often.

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:47.441
Blackberries are in season right now,

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:49.481
so I'll be picking every day until they're gone.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.201
I prep them so I have them all year long by washing,

00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:54.161
drying, and then freezing them.

00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:56.121
The kids were dying for some healthy muffins,

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.601
so that's exactly what I did.

00:00:57.602 --> 00:00:59.401
I whipped up a batch of whole grain,

00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:02.921
freshly milled muffins with a super ripe banana and a good ingredient

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:03.921
chocolate on top.

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:05.601
I was in the mood for some lentils,

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:08.201
so I added two cups to a Bowl with warm water

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.701
and some apple cider vinegar.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.000
These will soak for one to two days to neutralize fidic

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.081
acid and make nutrients more bioavailable to our body.

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:17.761
After 18 minutes of baking,

00:01:17.762 --> 00:01:20.661
I pulled the mini muffins out to let them cool on a rack.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.100
Follow along for part 2 to see what the rest of the day looks like.
