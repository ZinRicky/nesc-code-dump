00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.600
the day started with a yoga class

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:03.041
cause it turns out if I don't

00:00:03.042 --> 00:00:04.481
not only am I a sore bitch

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:05.801
I'm also just a bitch

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.460
and cause I'm irrevocably deep in my 

00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:08.761
handmaid's era at the moment

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:11.221
the first thing I did when I got home was make bread

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.706
praise be

00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:13.081
then I learnt that apparently

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:15.401
I'm the only person who actually looks in the fridge in this house

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:17.278
which means I'm also the only person who 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.881
notices when it needs to be cleaned

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:19.879
Blessed be the fruit 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.161
vegetables and other things I keep in the fridge

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.511
I was determined to not dedicate all of my 

00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:26.281
spare time to the upkeep of my house

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:27.081
today instead

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:29.168
I just dedicated most of my spare time 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.881
to the upkeep of the house today

00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:32.841
being a homemaker is so rewarding

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:34.921
I'm not too sure yet what the reward is

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:36.481
but one day when I figure it out

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:38.361
rest assured you'll be the first to know

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:41.481
actually I might have recently stumbled across one such reward

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:42.961
my new toilet cleaner is pink

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:45.241
and this fills me with a feeling that I can only assume

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:47.516
normal people would describe as happiness 

00:00:47.517 --> 00:00:47.841
anyway

00:00:47.842 --> 00:00:50.321
I absolutely could not be fkd cooking dinner tonight

00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:52.641
so I decided to throw it together in the afternoon

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:54.201
so that when the evening rolls around

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:56.521
it might actually feel like somebody else cook for me

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:57.881
I'm trying out a new recipe

00:00:57.882 --> 00:00:59.281
which I'm affectionately calling

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:00.721
“Chuck a whole lot of random shit in a pot

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:02.241
cook it on low and hope for the best”

00:01:02.242 --> 00:01:03.761
we might need a workshop the name

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:07.121
but a slow cooked meal is ideal because it frees me up to do other things

00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:08.321
like care for the children

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:10.841
and maybe even tackle some of my husband's jobs

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:12.848
and one thing I learnt through that experience

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:14.201
 is it's not actually that hard

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:16.081
and dare I say it it's quite fun

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:18.681
made even more fun by the fact that children don't dare bother you

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:20.281
while you have loud machine in your hands

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:22.249
Which leads me to conclude that the menfolk 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.681
have been gatekeeping once again

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.201
by the time I finished the housework

00:01:25.202 --> 00:01:26.801
the childcare and the yard work

00:01:26.802 --> 00:01:28.641
the dinner had largely cooked itself

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:30.521
all I needed to do was pair a grain with it

00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:32.521
bake some bread and throw together a salad

00:01:32.522 --> 00:01:34.081
so really, not that much

00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:35.628
and then everybody requested pudding 

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:36.841
as they do almost every night

00:01:36.842 --> 00:01:38.121
so I put my daughter to work

00:01:38.122 --> 00:01:40.481
and together we whipped up a dark chocolate hazelnut

00:01:40.482 --> 00:01:42.161
self saucing pudding from scratch

00:01:42.162 --> 00:01:44.761
and it was absolutely fkn delicious if I'm honest

00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:46.342
and the dopamine from the chocolate made 

00:01:46.343 --> 00:01:47.743
all of the day’s hard work 

00:01:47.744 --> 00:01:48.781
almost feel worth it
