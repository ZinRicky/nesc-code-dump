00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.480
But for real,

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.120
I'm having a good moment because I had to go drop my

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.940
something off for my daughter at school.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.660
And because I've been very transparent

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.120
in a respectful way.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.520
You know, there

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.480
you can always say

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.940
you got a high conflict

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.920
without dogging the other person,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.240
but, you know,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.440
you can explain, hey,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.200
you could just point out

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.680
she like, hey,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.240
I currently have 100% education,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.540
making that. That.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.160
That, uh. Right.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.320
Was stripped of the other parents.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.740
So you know what I mean?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.280
You just kind of

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.900
help them see the situation for what it is without.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.100
There's ways to do that.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.440
But now when I go to the school,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.760
they're so nice to me.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.360
I go and I've talked to the receptionist

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.680
and I've explained the situation like this.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.180
I don't get to see her talk to my kids.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.720
She's like, how?

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.840
I had a father like that too.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.980
I know what's going on.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.840
And so now if I just have to drop off

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.240
the simplest thing,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.840
I say, can you call her to the front

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.420
so I can say hi really quick?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.280
No problems.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740
Doesn't even look, got it.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
And I get to see my kids and say hi

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.900
and fucking skirt that,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.820
you know what I mean?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.340
Fuck them. They don't win.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.057
They don't win.
