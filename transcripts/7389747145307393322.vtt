00:00.040 --> 00:01.660
It was way past my bedtime,

00:01.680 --> 00:04.300
and even though take out did sound enticing,

00:04.440 --> 00:07.840
I knew it wouldn't hit the same as a home cooked comfort meal.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.121
So today we made some bangers and mash,

00:10.122 --> 00:13.601
but without the mash. Instead we did roast potatoes.

00:13.602 --> 00:16.841
I still had a few potatoes left that our friends brought from Idaho,

00:16.842 --> 00:18.881
so I cut those up, boiled them,

00:18.882 --> 00:19.761
and shook them

00:19.762 --> 00:24.281
before transferring them over onto a baking sheet with hot duck fat.

00:24.282 --> 00:28.681
Season my potatoes before popping them in the oven for 45 minutes.

00:28.682 --> 00:29.441
In the meantime,

00:29.442 --> 00:33.961
I got started on my red wine gravy by slicing up some red onions

00:33.962 --> 00:36.661
and sauteing them in a pot with some butter.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.800
Once they softened and got some color,

00:38.801 --> 00:40.561
I sprinkled in some flour

00:40.562 --> 00:43.801
before pouring in some of my red wine beef stock

00:43.802 --> 00:47.001
and then letting that simmer on the stove until it thickened up,

00:47.002 --> 00:48.601
which was about 30 minutes.

00:48.602 --> 00:52.701
In the meantime, I got started on prepping my lemon garlic broccolini.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.960
Took some of the stems off and thinly sliced my garlic

00:55.961 --> 00:59.281
before sauteing all of that in some olive oil, salt,

00:59.282 --> 01:01.501
pepper, and a squeeze of lemon.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.800
I also had some of these really good German sausages in the fridge,

01:04.801 --> 01:08.041
so I let those brown and then it was time to plate.

01:08.042 --> 01:12.041
Put my duck fat roasted potatoes down some broccoli knee my sausages,

01:12.042 --> 01:14.481
and then spooned over my red wine gravy.

01:14.482 --> 01:18.181
This is one of my comfort meals and it's absolutely Divine
