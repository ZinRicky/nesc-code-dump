00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.760
Let me show you the delicious dinner I made

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.680
for my family of six using these little 10 inch pans.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.000
I first started out with this

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.760
almost 2 pound flat iron steak

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.840
and it was very thick,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.420
but I was still able to get a nice crust on the outside

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.920
because these pans heat amazingly and evenly.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.280
And then with just a wet paper towel,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.960
I was able to wipe out all the crust

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.480
and char from cooking that steak,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.680
which usually a pan would have to soak to do that,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.960
but it just wipes out like nothing.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.960
And I'm able to move on to the next item.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.400
I, while the steak was resting,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.240
I heated up some garlic butter

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.460
shrimp from the freezer

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.080
and then it was time to cut up the steak.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.440
And look how beautifully that thing was cooked

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.960
on the inside.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.920
Nice and pink,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.580
medium, but fully cooked.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.440
And that's it,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.160
dinner was served.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.260
I just got one pan dirty,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.200
combined it with some salad,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.640
some rolls and trust me,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.360
everybody was very full,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.280
very satisfied,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.500
and I only had one pan to clean.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.000
If you wanna get a set of these pans,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.240
which I highly recommend,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.481
