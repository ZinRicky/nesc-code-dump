00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.340
Ladies, stop being victims.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.800
Do you know how many comments I read about women

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.281
thinking that it's just for every corporate company

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:09.361
to give them time off for their menstrual cycles

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:11.141
or time off for their pregnancy?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.160
These companies were built by men.

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:17.241
Now, I don't think that we are any more suppressed now

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:19.081
than we were in the last few decades.

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:21.801
I think we have all the freedom in the world in America.

00:00:21.802 --> 00:00:27.421
But yes, corporate structure was created by men and the patriarchy.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.180
Not in a negative way, because they built our world.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.420
So the 9 to 5 schedule is conducive to a man.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.640
So if you care about that type of justice so much,

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:41.461
then you go start a company from scratch,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.940
make it go public, build it into a billion dollar empire.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.040
And then you, as a woman,

00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:48.001
can decide, I'm going to hire women

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.081
and give them time off for their mistral cycles

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.601
or for their pregnancy, or for their birth.

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:55.161
But here's what I don't understand.

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:56.761
We have equal opportunity.

00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:58.161
But why, as a woman,

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:01.121
would you want to work exactly like a man?

00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:03.601
You wanna know why every woman in America is sick,

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:06.521
has adrenal fatigue, has chronic cortisol,

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:10.601
high cortisol levels? Why all of us are hormonally imbalanced

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:12.381
and most of us are now infertile?

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.000
Because we decided somewhere,

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:15.121
along with modern feminism,

00:01:15.122 --> 00:01:18.961
that it was a good idea to be exactly like men.

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:21.921
So a few years ago, I decided to Honor my body.

00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:23.901
Honor my cycle and my hormones.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.400
And learn how to work from home if your family needs that extra income.

00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:29.707
And I have helped thousands of women do it.
