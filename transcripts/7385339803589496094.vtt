00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.060
Today is my husband's in my 11th anniversary.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.260
It's been seven years that he's avoided store bought Nutella

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.640
because of the less than satisfactory ingredients,

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.841
so that's exactly what I'm surprising him with.

00:00:10.842 --> 00:00:13.681
While my hazelnuts roasted for 10 minutes in the oven,

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:16.921
I cleaned one of my cutting boards with my non toxic concentrate

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:18.821
and oxy from Branch Basics.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.840
While that penetrated the moldy wood,

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:23.021
I continued on to my homemade Nutella

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.700
by rubbing the spoons off of the roasted hazelnuts.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.920
Although slightly tedious,

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:28.601
this process didn't take long.

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:32.201
With a food processor, I process the nuts into a hazelnut butter

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:34.241
and then added the remaining ingredients.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:37.961
Nutella has 22 grams of refined sugar for just 2 tablespoons.

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:39.861
And it's got GMO soy, too,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.720
which is why I'm making mine with just a small amount of maple sugar

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:44.441
and free of Gmos and glyphosate.

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:45.881
After scrubbing my cutting board,

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:48.001
I was truly shocked by how clean it became,

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.001
especially since I'd considered throwing it out

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:51.681
after firming up in the pantry.

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:54.041
The homemade Nutella was not only scoop worthy,

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:55.861
it was also husband approved.
