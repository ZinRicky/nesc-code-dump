whenever I post about homeschooling in the summertime

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:05.360
I always get comments like you're ruining their childhood

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:06.900
let your kids be kids

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.200
but in January when we are at Busch Gardens and Seaworld and Disney

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:16.000
those same people are commenting about how my kids need to be in school

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:17.820
I'm neglecting their education

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.100
make it make sense
