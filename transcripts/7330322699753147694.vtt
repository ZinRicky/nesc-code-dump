00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome, friends.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.420
Come hang out with me while I milk my cow.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.580
First thing, I need to unload some feedable yesterday.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.440
And very important step.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.500
Turn off the fence.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.280
I'm waiting for Cora to get in her trained position

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.620
before she gets to feed.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.060
And now she gets a reward.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.940
She gets a layered feed bowl of stock feed,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.860
oats, and cracked corn.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.840
She also gets bar switches,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.080
black oil, sunflower seeds,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.300
and some minerals.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.960
And I layer it all so it's kinda mixed together

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.420
so I don't have to premix it.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.100
Now I'm going to sanitize and wash her teeth.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.280
They're not really dirty,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.680
so I'm just gonna sanitize them.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.540
I have soap and a bleach wash here in my bucket.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.000
Then I'm gonna spray out her teats

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.040
just to get rid of the milk that's already in her tea.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.500
And give her a little dry.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.980
Make sure those nips are dry.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.820
Now I'm going to set up my milk machine.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.040
I got this from minisupply,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.460
and it's a German brand and can't say the name,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.320
but hey ho, it's a great machine.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.520
And here I am setting it up.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.440
It's nice and clean,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.940
but when I cleaned it yesterday,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.840
one of the cups here,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.840
I put a plug in

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.620
because one of her quarters is not milking right now.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.120
You can hear the machine,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.120
but I actually lowered the sound

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.380
because it's really loud

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.880
once it's on.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.220
I just let it do its thing and suck up the Milk.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.240
The machine does a great job

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.000
of pulling the milk out of her others.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.440
As she has such small teeth,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.860
kinda hard to handle her.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.940
This machine can fully milk her out in a few minutes.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.080
Her left side of her utter always creates more milk.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.140
And you can see here that it's still bulging.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.000
Once I'm feeling it's kind of looser,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.440
I'm gonna take the claw off

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.780
to make sure I don't open. Milk.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.620
Look at that delicious milk.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.600
Now it's time to clean.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.520
I'm gonna using dish soap.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.140
There's already some bleach in the bucket.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.240
And suck all that through

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.540
to rinse and sanitize out the milk.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.120
I'm gonna get a rinse to get rid of all the soap.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.640
And then I'm gonna rinse through with a acid wash.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.980
Right now I'm using vinegar.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.360
You can use a dairy acid as well.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.720
I'm gonna rinse all that milk out

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.600
and make sure there's no soap left over.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.940
And then I'm gonna let it set to dry for tomorrow.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.480
Need to make sure I turn the fence back on

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.660
cause sometimes I forget.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.220
And now it's time to take the milk back to the house.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.800
This is my milking area

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.560
where I like to bottle all my milk.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.600
And the kids like to just use it at the dumping area.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.160
So here I am

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.420
having to clean and sanitize it before I start bottling.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.240
And today I'm bottling for myself.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.120
So I'm gonna use a few different types. Of bottles.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.660
I have about two gallons of milk,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.160
and this is the. What I'm picking today.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.440
This is the filters that I use is a dairy milk filter.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.680
This is specifically designed to filter milk,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.560
and I'm gonna put it on my milk strainer here,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.720
which fits perfectly on top of a Mason jar.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.280
I have a few strainers,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.300
but this one works pretty well for Mason jars.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.860
Now just have to dump it into the bottles

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.460
and filter the milk.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.920
Once the milk's done filtering,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.760
I can see on the screen of the filter

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.920
to see if there's anything

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.540
like mastitis or anything I need to be aware of.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.280
And right now,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.640
she's healthy and there's no issues.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.420
So this milk is good to consume.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.240
2

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.040
1.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.560
It was starting to get pretty hot in the sunroom,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.660
so I turned my mystical heater off.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.960
Actually really like these jars that I'm pouring.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.880
This one, the square jar,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.800
I got this from Walmart,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.860
and it was really cheap,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.280
and it has the lid attached to it,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.280
so I never have to go find lids.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.340
Then I'm gonna retrieve my hidden sharpie

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.640
and write the day on all the jars.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.000
I write the day of today,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.780
the day that the cow was melt.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.280
And the milk will be good for about two weeks out

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.180
from this date.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.640
Then I went to retrieve some lids,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.640
because I never have any lids around.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.360
They're always just like.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.240
Just got the dishwasher.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.460
And I just throw them in the drawer.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.040
I'm going to wipe the bottom of the jar

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.620
so I don't get milk in the fridge.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.860
And here is a quick milk fridge shot.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.920
And that's how I milk my cow once per day.
