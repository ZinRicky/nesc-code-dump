00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.720
Whenever the conversation of single fathers wants to come up,

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:04.841
I would really love if we would make note

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:09.321
that 41% of single fathers cohabitate with a partner.

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:13.501
So they're not really entirely doing it on their own.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.360
They're working the same exact schedule.

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.921
They're working, and now they have just a different woman stepping in

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:19.641
doing exactly what they did.

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:22.501
Single mothers, only 16% of them cohabitate.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.040
And I'm sure the living situation in the homes is very,

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:27.101
very different for single mothers who cohabitate

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.720
and single fathers who cohabitate.

00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:30.241
Because a mom is still always gonna be a mom.

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:31.801
You're still always gonna have to do everything.

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:34.841
And the feminine duties, the wifely duties,

00:00:34.842 --> 00:00:37.441
the womanly duties are almost always gonna fall on the woman.

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.641
So life doesn't really change that much for single fathers.

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:41.441
But for single mothers,

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:44.921
they have to figure out an entirely whole new way of living.

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:46.481
They have to figure out how to earn an income,

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:47.401
how to keep their kids safe,

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:48.621
how to do everything.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.480
And even though 43% of men are cohabitating with women,

00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:54.741
when they finally do get help and live with somebody else,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560
they're judged so hard. Are you keeping your kids safe?

00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:58.881
Are you doing what's best for your kids?

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:00.021
You know, like,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.200
slow down when we're starting the fucking applause.

00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:04.201
When you see a single father,

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:06.421
like, calm the fuck down.
