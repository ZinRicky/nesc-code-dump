It's part of a sense of being dutiful and having no problem, actually,

00:06.121 --> 00:08.541
with being dutiful in a marriage.

00:10.840 --> 00:13.760
Yes, I believe that traditionalism can.

00:13.761 --> 00:18.621
It is putting your family before yourself. And I think it is.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.720
It is having those traditional values that were once

00:23.721 --> 00:26.601
definitely more in place. And god,

00:26.602 --> 00:32.921
family and love. And we live in a very selfish society now,

00:32.922 --> 00:35.441
you know, you see self love printed everywhere.

00:35.442 --> 00:38.041
Right. And, um, women.

00:38.042 --> 00:40.661
I'm speaking of divorce and marriage.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.800
Women are leaving marriage far more easy,

00:44.801 --> 00:48.081
easier than men. And they are, um,

00:48.082 --> 00:48.481
doing it

00:48.482 --> 00:51.041
because they think there's something better out there for them,

00:51.042 --> 00:53.121
that the grass is greener on the other side.

00:53.122 --> 00:55.281
And they're finding out that is wrong,

00:55.282 --> 00:58.381
and they're going through divorce after divorce. And, um.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.360
You know, marriage is a bond,

01:00.361 --> 01:03.521
and it's a sacred bond where two become one under god.

01:03.522 --> 01:07.541
And that's beautiful. And you have to protect that at all costs.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.040
And I think part of that is

01:09.041 --> 01:11.681
putting your partner's needs before your own

01:11.682 --> 01:14.281
every single day. And I try and do my best.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.801
And I think of my husband as much as I can

01:16.802 --> 01:19.581
and what will please him and make him happy.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.720
I love the sound of this. Sorry,

01:21.721 --> 01:22.561
I mean. I mean,

01:22.562 --> 01:24.901
obviously I don't. I wouldn't dare to express
