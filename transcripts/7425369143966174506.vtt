00:00.040 --> 00:01.840
I had a very emotional morning,

00:01.841 --> 00:04.201
and I was craving a little pick me up drink,

00:04.320 --> 00:07.600
since I've been thinking about making horchata for the last few days,

00:07.601 --> 00:09.681
I decided to just make it today.

00:09.682 --> 00:12.201
I soaked my rice in some water with cinnamon

00:12.202 --> 00:13.801
for about four to five hours

00:13.802 --> 00:16.861
while I got started on making some condensed milk.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.280
Combine milk and sugar, put that on the stove,

00:19.281 --> 00:23.081
and then made some evaporated milk by just boiling off some milk.

00:23.082 --> 00:26.241
After about 45 minutes, my condensed milk was done,

00:26.242 --> 00:29.301
so I strained it and put that in the fridge to thicken.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.800
Done to straining all the skin off my evaporated milk

00:32.801 --> 00:34.761
before letting that cool as well.

00:34.762 --> 00:36.761
While those were cooling in the fridge,

00:36.762 --> 00:38.241
I poured my rice, water,

00:38.242 --> 00:40.921
and a little bit of the cinnamon into my blender.

00:40.922 --> 00:44.921
I blended that for about five minutes before straining that as well,

00:44.922 --> 00:48.961
making sure I get all the liquid out before adding that to a big jug.

00:48.962 --> 00:50.521
Putting my condensed milk,

00:50.522 --> 00:55.081
my evaporated milk, and about another two cups of water to thin it out.

00:55.082 --> 00:56.841
I gave that a really good stir,

00:56.842 --> 01:00.001
and I was finally done. Filled up my glass with some ice,

01:00.002 --> 01:02.561
added my horchata, a dash of cinnamon,

01:02.562 --> 01:05.581
and this was so divine and hit the spot.
