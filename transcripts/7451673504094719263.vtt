00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
If this is your first Christmas away from your children,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.280
and you are dreading it and truly don't know how you're gonna make it,

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:10.421
I want you to know you're gonna make it.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.140
I have four kids. One of them has down syndrome.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.420
She had her first open heart surgery at 4 days old.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.880
She almost died several times.

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.481
They had to resuscitate her back to life.

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:23.221
And when she was finally discharged,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.860
they said, Mrs. Templeton,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.520
this child at one time

00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:31.561
was ten times sicker than even the sickest child in this hospital.

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.521
The cancer unit, the burn unit,

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:34.801
anywhere you look in this hospital,

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:37.121
she was 10 times sicker than their sickest kid.

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:40.101
And I did not think she was ever gonna make it.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.480
And I but almost fucking broke down when he told me that.

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.921
Cause I was like, you reassured me this whole time,

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:47.161
and I was trusting in your words,

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:48.921
and you didn't even believe in your own fucking words.

00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:50.501
But she was. She made it.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.440
She's now in middle school.

00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:55.481
She's fine. She's had many other heart surgeries and other things.

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:57.021
But what I'm saying is, like,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.600
I understand feeling like. No,

00:00:59.601 --> 00:00:59.961
no, no,

00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:00.321
no, no,

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:00.921
no, no, no.

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:04.481
You don't get it. I don't know how I'm gonna make it

00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:08.741
if I don't see and hold my children on this day that, like,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.900
is motherhood. Like who.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.780
Who is Santa? Mom.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.360
Who makes the magic, the Christmas Magic?

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:16.961
Mom, what do you work?

00:01:16.962 --> 00:01:18.321
So hard. All year long.

00:01:18.322 --> 00:01:20.361
All year long, you're using Santa as an excuse.

00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:23.081
And then this one day is the day that you don't get to see your kids.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:27.141
And you know that somebody else is taking joy and pleasure in that.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.800
They're.

00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:32.261
They're not gonna enjoy the day the way that you would enjoy the day.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.440
The. So you.

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:34.501
You know what I mean?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.560
And you're pissed that they're doing it to take it away from you,

00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:41.581
not to enjoy it. That's. Do you know what I mean?

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.240
You're super valid in feeling all the hurt feelings.

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:49.241
And I think the more you try to escape them,

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.081
the more they chase you. So

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:53.941
you need to just spend a good amount of time crying

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.420
and feeling like shit

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.640
and, like,

00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:59.821
checking in with yourself and see what do you need.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.400
Do you know what I mean? On Christmas Day,

00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:05.981
you could. I truly drove.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.800
Drove to the mountains and walked around,

00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:12.781
like, a snowy little hiking path

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.760
because I didn't wanna see anything Christmas Eve I didn't wanna do.

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.461
And that's okay. You can do that.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.940
Like, do whatever the fuck it is that you wanna do.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.860
Sleep in bed all day, do whatever.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.740
And you know what?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.840
I kind of found a little joy in, like,

00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:30.661
holy shit, this day is usually pretty fucking exhausting,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.700
and I actually,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.120
you know, I was so fucking sad and depressed,

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.841
I didn't do much. Fuck.

00:02:36.842 --> 00:02:38.341
This is actually kind of nice.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.440
So you do get to a place where you'll feel better.

00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:43.921
You do get to a place where you find,

00:02:43.922 --> 00:02:44.821
like, peace,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.580
and it doesn't sting as much.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.520
And I just want to encourage you to keep going.

00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:54.301
You're gonna. You're gonna be okay, and you'll make it.
