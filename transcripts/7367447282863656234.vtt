00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.560
I just wanna break down some Justin Bieber lyrics,

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:04.961
because if you listen to the shit that he sings,

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:07.261
motherfucker is toxic as fuck.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.040
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice.

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:16.101
And by maybe once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times, okay?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.600
He's saying it right there.

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:20.341
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.880
How many of us have heard that from a dude like, oh baby,

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:24.721
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:25.801
But hold on, let's hear more.

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:27.641
Is it too late now to say sorry?

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:30.461
Cause I'm missing more than just your body.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.880
So he sends that you up text knowing full well,

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:35.521
and now he's gotta be okay,

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:36.761
well, missing more than just your body.

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.461
Can we just fuck one more time?

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.260
But let's see more.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.400
And this is where we really realize how fucking toxic he is,

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:47.141
because he says, um,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.600
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to.

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:54.081
But you know, there's no innocent one in this game for two. Motherfucker,

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:55.441
sometimes you are the one who did wrong.

00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:57.401
Like if you cheated on me,

00:00:57.402 --> 00:00:58.801
how do I have to say sorry?

00:00:58.802 --> 00:01:00.041
How am I participating in this?

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:04.341
That sounds like a 100% you're fucking wrong type situation. But.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.320
And then can we both say the words and forget this?

00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:10.561
How many times have you been in an argument with a fucking guy

00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:11.201
and you're like

00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:12.801
what The fuck am I saying sorry for?

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:13.761
But you say it just because

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:16.021
you gotta get the fucking conversation over with.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.400
I know that I let you down.

00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:19.801
Is it too late to say sorry now?

00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:22.741
Yes, it's too fucking late to say sorry.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.160
Yes, but you're a toxic prick that doesn't wanna hear that,

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.081
doesn't accept no for an answer and doesn't go away.

00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:33.681
And then when the relationship starting to reach that 7 year itch time,

00:01:33.682 --> 00:01:35.561
boom! You get her pregnant,

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.841
this shits bounce. A fail.

00:01:37.842 --> 00:01:40.401
I feel sorry for the baby, but whatever.

00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:41.901
Block the fucking celebrities
