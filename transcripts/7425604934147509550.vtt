00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
whether or not you wanna post political content on your page

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:05.720
on social media is entirely your choice

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:08.840
I know I don't wanna open up my page everyday and see doom and gloom

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:09.920
because there's a lot of it

00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:13.520
there's a lot of it and sometimes we need an entertainment reprieve

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:15.960
we need the light so as a content creator

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:17.280
that is entirely your choice

00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:19.900
however I believe as a woman and as a mother

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.160
your role in society is inherently political

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:27.880
motherhood is political because whether or not you participate in the politics

00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:30.240
or the propagandizing of motherhood

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.960
your identity is being used to further political agendas

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:35.520
from the left and from the right

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.220
and this is not a new thing

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.720
society has created this entire identity around what a mother is

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:45.140
all the way back from Mary Magdalene to Florence Henderson

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.360
how we depict mothers

00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:49.640
and motherhood has always said something about how we view women

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:52.660
and how we view the role of mother in society

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.360
just why I talk so much about motherhood

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:56.960
and the identity of motherhood on this page

00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:59.200
because it is such a fascinating subject

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:02.820
because you go from being an individual into this archetype

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.720
this idea in people's minds

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.400
so whether or not you like it

00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:09.160
the role of mother once you take that on

00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:11.440
is going to politicize your identity

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:13.060
so you don't have to talk about it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.620
but you should be aware of it
