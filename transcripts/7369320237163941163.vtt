00:00.000 --> 00:00.560
This morning

00:00.561 --> 00:03.601
my husband ran out of the moisturizer that he usually uses

00:03.602 --> 00:05.761
and he didn't love it enough to repurchase,

00:05.762 --> 00:08.021
so he just decided to make his own.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.360
He combined some beef tallow and beeswax in a metal bowl

00:11.361 --> 00:14.201
and let that melt over some boiling water.

00:14.202 --> 00:16.161
Once everything was melted down,

00:16.162 --> 00:20.361
he turned off the heat before he mixed some squalene and ojoba oil,

00:20.362 --> 00:24.201
which he poured back into the melted beeswax and beef tallow

00:24.202 --> 00:25.881
before giving that a good stir,

00:25.882 --> 00:29.041
taking that off the heat and adding the last three things,

00:29.042 --> 00:31.201
which was some vitamin E oil,

00:31.202 --> 00:33.501
hyaluronic acid, and glycerin.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.600
He made sure to give it a mix after adding each ingredient

00:36.601 --> 00:40.141
and at the end just mixed it until it was all combined.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.520
Once combined, he transferred it over to a little glass jar.

00:43.521 --> 00:45.561
He made sure to fill all the way to the top

00:45.562 --> 00:48.601
before scraping off any extra popped on the lid

00:48.602 --> 00:51.281
and transferred it over to the fridge to set.

00:51.282 --> 00:55.041
Later that night when we got out the shower, we decided to test it.

00:55.042 --> 00:57.161
I struggle with eczema and really dry skin,

00:57.162 --> 01:01.321
so he didn't add any essential oils so it would also work for me.

01:01.322 --> 01:02.092
We loved it.
