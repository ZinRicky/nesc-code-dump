00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.200
I'm on vacation right now,

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.641
so I haven't been able to access and read

00:00:02.642 --> 00:00:04.041
the entire New York Times article

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:06.161
about the ballerina farms tribe wife phenomenon,

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:08.801
but I have seen some clips and some takeaways,

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:11.081
so let's talk about it. This entire time,

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:14.081
I think all of us assumed that she had full time nanny help

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:15.921
and potentially overnight nanny help.

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.641
The fact that she says she doesn't,

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:20.821
that there is no outside help other than a homeschool teacher,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.560
is almost more shocking and more upsetting somehow,

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:28.841
because it means that she actually is not getting a break.

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:30.201
It means. And once again,

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:34.021
this is the problem with glamorizing this sort of Chad wife lifestyle.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.860
It leads to this sort of subservient self sacrifice

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.000
that is unsustainable.

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.081
Another creator quoted the article and said that Daniel,

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:44.941
the husband,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.240
made light of the fact that she gets so overwhelmed sometimes

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.621
with how much she does that she has to stay in bed for a week.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.780
That is clinical depression and or clinical exhaustion.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.920
That's not something to be, like,

00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:00.721
benchmarking as some sort of standard to hit.

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:04.301
There's this underlying religious tone of self sacrifice

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.380
on the part of the mother specifically.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.900
That is a beast that will never be full and finished.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.200
Because what's the standard for success?

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:15.801
What does it look like to be a successful child life?

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:17.721
Is it working yourself to death?

00:01:17.722 --> 00:01:20.961
Is it so your husband can look at you like a prize workhorse in a Way.

00:01:20.962 --> 00:01:23.121
I almost feel bad for this woman. Um,

00:01:23.122 --> 00:01:25.641
and I didn't think I would say that.

00:01:25.642 --> 00:01:29.881
Not because I don't understand her lifestyle, um,

00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:33.521
but it because of how glamorize she's made it online

00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:36.101
and those messages that are getting out to other people.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.760
I don't know. She's drink the Kool aid, too,

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:41.681
and it's really fucking sad.

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:42.841
I will be back with more, like,

00:01:42.842 --> 00:01:44.001
well articulated thoughts,

00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:45.321
but that was just my first take

00:01:45.322 --> 00:01:47.641
on hearing some of the things from this article.

00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:49.101
I need to get, like,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.040
somehow I have to be able to read it while I'm over here

00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:52.356
so I can give a proper take.
