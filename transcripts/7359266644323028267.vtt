00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.000
Y'all, so many people asked about my head scarf,

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.261
and I love it because it's actually from a small shop on Etsy.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.000
And this is gonna be just like when the girlies are like.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.701
It has pockets, but

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.240
it's a Jersey turban headband,

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:18.881
so it takes all the work out of wrapping your own hair.

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:21.001
Gonna try and do it here,

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.721
but I don't have one of those little card clippy things.

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.201
Put it on like you would like

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:28.001
when you put on a little toddler turban hair thing for.

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:28.941
For a baby.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.520
This color I got custom.

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:33.201
I did a custom order because,

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:34.521
you know, your girl likes pink,

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:36.081
but she has so many options on the website.

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:37.681
I'm gonna show you her site now.

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:39.081
This is her Etsy shop.

00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:40.201
She's based out of Germany.

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:41.601
It's called jazzefine.

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:42.921
She has so many different options.

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:43.601
Here's the pink one.

00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:45.161
She added it to her listing.

00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:46.401
I have a couple of these.

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:48.681
The strawberry hat that I wore to Charleston. Wine and food.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.081
This is completely unsponsored.

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:51.881
I just like to share where I get cool shit.

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:54.468
So go get yourself one. So cute.
