00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.880
do you have a morning routine or do things every morning that you just love

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:05.360
my goal for July has been to establish a good morning routine

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:06.520
and start by waking up early

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:07.160
before my kids now

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:08.560
I am not a morning person

00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:10.720
so 7:00am is about as early as I'm gonna get up

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:13.140
for the last 24 days I have gone up at 7:00am

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.060
drink a protein drink listen to my Bible app

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.600
and now I don't know what else to do

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:20.720
I've tried journaling but I'm just not awake enough to figure out my thoughts

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.160
I've also tried meditating

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:23.240
and it just does not work for

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:26.200
so if you have a good morning habits that you love and think are so helpful

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:27.262
please help me out
