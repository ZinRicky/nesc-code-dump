00:00.080 --> 00:01.640
So back in the 60s and 70s,

00:01.640 --> 00:03.560
there was a researcher named John Calhoun,

00:03.560 --> 00:04.640
and he did an experiment

00:04.640 --> 00:07.840
where he created a perfect mouse Utopia.

00:07.840 --> 00:08.880
He started with four males,

00:08.880 --> 00:09.640
four females,

00:09.640 --> 00:12.000
and he put them in this environment that was

00:12.000 --> 00:13.680
perfectly catered to their every need.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.720
They had an unlimited supply of food,

00:15.720 --> 00:17.640
water, there was plenty of shelter,

00:17.640 --> 00:19.340
plenty of nesting material,

00:19.360 --> 00:21.300
and it was completely free of any predators.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.560
At the beginning of the experiment,

00:22.560 --> 00:23.480
things were going fine.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.600
The mice were having babies,

00:24.600 --> 00:25.560
they were happy,

00:25.560 --> 00:26.520
they were eating a lot,

00:26.520 --> 00:27.200
they were healthy,

00:27.200 --> 00:27.880
and things were good.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.960
But once the population hit around 600,

00:29.960 --> 00:32.360
the population growth started to decline,

00:32.360 --> 00:33.920
and their little mouse society

00:33.920 --> 00:35.400
started to see a lot of problems.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.400
My started splitting off into different groups,

00:37.400 --> 00:39.560
and a lot of the males started to withdraw,

00:39.560 --> 00:42.040
having no real role in society.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.920
And they would all gather in these groups

00:43.920 --> 00:45.640
and start just attacking each other.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.840
The behaviors of the females change, too.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.600
They begin needing to fulfill more aggressive roles

00:50.600 --> 00:53.040
because the males were absent in those roles

00:53.040 --> 00:53.840
in their nests.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.560
And despite their every need being catered to,

00:55.560 --> 00:57.480
the mothers started to abandon their babies

00:57.480 --> 00:58.680
or even kill them.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.760
The entire society quickly became very violent,

01:01.760 --> 01:03.080
very hyper sexual.

01:03.080 --> 01:03.720
And eventually,

01:03.720 --> 01:06.000
the few mice who made it into adulthood,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.600
having been around such unusual behaviors,

01:08.600 --> 01:12.060
had no interest in mating and engaging with anyone.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.040
And they would go up and Live in their own little

01:14.040 --> 01:15.460
individual shelters

01:15.680 --> 01:17.300
and just watch everything go down.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.360
The low birth rate,

01:18.360 --> 01:20.260
the high infant mortality rate,

01:20.360 --> 01:22.560
those two things combined with the violence,

01:22.560 --> 01:23.440
and eventually

01:23.440 --> 01:25.460
the entire colony went extinct.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.680
Calhoun referred to the process as behavioral sync,

01:27.680 --> 01:30.200
and he found it really interesting that despite,

01:30.200 --> 01:31.940
or maybe because of,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.520
having every single need met,

01:34.520 --> 01:37.100
the mass environment never even reached full capacity.
