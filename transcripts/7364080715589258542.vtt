00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540
And her man got arrested for stalking me,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.080
breaking the Protection order that I had.

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:10.281
Not only did she bail him out of jail,

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:11.961
she tried to keep my children away from me.

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:15.121
Like, she thought she was gonna uphold his parenting time

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:17.941
and block me from picking up my children.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.220
Like, Nana,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.980
like,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.440
what the fuck are you thinking?

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:28.181
You are not a fucking parent!

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.340
I have found myself in life in a few positions where I.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.520
Where literally, I was like,

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:34.001
oh, my god,

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.461
I thought that could never happen to me.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.200
Like, when I was 29,

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:40.521
I gave birth to a daughter with down syndrome.

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:42.801
I was 29. I was 29.

00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:44.081
I was in my fucking 20s.

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:48.141
I should not have had a child with a disability like this.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.680
And we did genetic testing,

00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:51.081
and it truly was luck of the draw.

00:00:51.082 --> 00:00:52.881
Like, congratulations,

00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:53.961
you won the genetic lottery.

00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:55.521
Here's a kid with down syndrome.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:56.201
And it's whatever.

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:58.281
It's not the big deal that I thought it was.

00:00:58.282 --> 00:00:59.121
So I'm like, oh, okay.

00:00:59.122 --> 00:00:59.721
No, I'm good.

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:03.641
I'm okay. And then that kid had four open heart surgeries,

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:04.281
and I was like, wow,

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:05.321
that's a lot, but okay.

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:06.421
We got through that.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.620
And then, like,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.120
do you know what I mean?

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:12.521
So I've just been in some situations where now I'm like,

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:13.561
it could happen to me,

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:15.561
and I wanna do everything I can to fucking prevent it.

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:16.941
And so I just try to, like,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.520
learn as much As I can about anything.

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:20.401
Like, before I'm gonna do something,

00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:22.281
I genuinely. I just don't like getting hurt.

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:23.361
I don't like being hurt physically.

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:24.361
I don't like being hurt emotionally.

00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:25.401
I don't think it's necessary.

00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:29.121
I think plenty of people have Learned all the lessons in life

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.721
to give me the guidance I need to get through

00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:33.621
without falling into those same traps.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.880
As I do everything I can

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.501
to protect myself from falling into those same traps,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.880
one of the situations that I'm like,

00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:40.281
oh, my god.

00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:44.181
I never thought this could happen was when I separated with my ex,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.200
and he brought a new woman into the lives of our child.

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:48.601
And I, to this day,

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:49.601
five years later,

00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:52.321
have never fucking met this person.

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:54.801
She has lived with my children

00:01:54.802 --> 00:02:00.741
and never had the fucking decency to even look me in the eyes once.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.500
I never, never could a fucking imagine that this is the way it would be.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.120
I don't know. I think coming from a weird family,

00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:13.461
there has been divorce and separations and.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.520
I mean, half my uncles and aunts are not blood related.

00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:16.961
It's, oh,

00:02:16.962 --> 00:02:18.201
but she married this other guy.

00:02:18.202 --> 00:02:19.041
That's your cousin?

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:21.061
But that's not her dad or blah, blah, blah.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.640
So this wasn't foreign to me.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.801
What's foreign to me is the animosity.

00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:25.601
Like, Nana,

00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:26.601
I don't want him.

00:02:26.602 --> 00:02:27.361
You can have him.

00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:28.721
I'm not even gonna talk shit about him.

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:30.541
Go for it, girl.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.620
I don't know.
