00:00.040 --> 00:02.520
When I asked my toddlers what they wanted for dinner

00:02.521 --> 00:04.481
and they both requested Spaghettios,

00:04.482 --> 00:06.241
I was a little taken aback.

00:06.242 --> 00:09.081
I wasn't aware that they knew what Spaghettios were,

00:09.082 --> 00:11.781
but nevertheless, I made them some for dinner,

00:11.880 --> 00:14.080
cut my tomatoes in half, grated them,

00:14.081 --> 00:17.921
and then moved on to thinly slicing my garlic and dicing up my onion.

00:17.922 --> 00:20.481
I made sure to get a smaller dice on those.

00:20.482 --> 00:22.921
I added some olive oil and garlic to my pot,

00:22.922 --> 00:24.361
let that heat up on the stove

00:24.362 --> 00:27.001
before adding in my onions and some tomato paste.

00:27.002 --> 00:28.281
Once that had a few minutes,

00:28.282 --> 00:30.081
I poured in my grated tomato,

00:30.082 --> 00:32.841
leftover Parmesan rind, some oregano, salt,

00:32.842 --> 00:36.021
a pinch of sugar, just a touch of balsamic vinegar.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.120
Well, that was simmering.

00:37.121 --> 00:40.561
I got started on my pasta dough by combining some eggs,

00:40.562 --> 00:41.521
flour, salt,

00:41.522 --> 00:43.921
oil, and kneading that until it came together

00:43.922 --> 00:45.641
before wrapping it in plastic wrap

00:45.642 --> 00:47.601
and letting it chill for about an hour.

00:47.602 --> 00:50.881
I then used my pasta attachment to get shape I wanted

00:50.882 --> 00:52.881
before cutting it into smaller pieces

00:52.882 --> 00:55.721
and forming it into the classic spaghetti O shape.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.121
This took me about an hour,

00:57.122 --> 00:58.761
but it was definitely worth it.

00:58.762 --> 01:01.361
Once they were all done, I put them into the sauce,

01:01.362 --> 01:04.521
let them cook for about 10 minutes before it was time to serve.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.401
I plated both of them up a bowl,

01:06.402 --> 01:08.081
topped it with Parmesan cheese,

01:08.082 --> 01:09.777
and they both wanted seconds.
