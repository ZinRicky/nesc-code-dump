00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.160
My kids have never had the opportunity to eat popular

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.080
kid marketed foods

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.240
because my food standards are really high

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.240
and I prioritize health over convenience.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.920
Nevertheless,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.360
they can still enjoy these fun foods quite easily

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.360
with a little bit of creativity and desire.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.440
Their friends at school eat goldfish at snack time

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.920
and rather than feel like they're missing out,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.560
I decided to make some for my kids.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.680
A snack boxes to.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.640
The homemade version is so much more delicious

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.040
like a savory shortbread.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.000
These are made with all purpose eincorn flour

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.320
which gives them a lighter feel

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.480
than if using freshly milled

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.040
100% whole grain flour.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.200
Eincorn is ideal for kids with gluten sensitivity

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.520
as it doesn't upset the tummy.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.120
This all purpose flour contains 85% of the brand

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.280
in this freshly milled order.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.160
So it's not like the other white flowers

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.000
that have been sitting on the grocery shops for months

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.160
and stripped up their nutrients.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.160
This five ingredient

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
homemade goldfish is free of soybean oil

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.240
and glyphosate sprayed wheat,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.520
so this is a definite win.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.720
One thing I forgot to add in

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.080
was ground turmeric for yellow color,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.280
which I'll be sure to do next time

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.340
so that we can have a perfect goldfish dupe.
