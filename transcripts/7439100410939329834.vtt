00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
It's very rare that I'm home alone for dinner.

00:02.601 --> 00:04.921
That's when I get to cook whatever I'm craving,

00:04.922 --> 00:08.401
and today I was craving a steak pie with some mashed potatoes.

00:08.402 --> 00:10.561
This is my version of a girl dinner.

00:10.562 --> 00:13.221
I started by chopping up all of my vegetables,

00:13.440 --> 00:16.140
taking all the Brussel sprouts off of the stock,

00:16.160 --> 00:19.520
cut those up before moving on to slicing up my steak.

00:19.521 --> 00:23.721
I browned off the steak and got a good sear on it before taking it out,

00:23.722 --> 00:26.681
sauteing all of my vegetables for a couple minutes,

00:26.682 --> 00:28.161
deglazing with some red wine

00:28.162 --> 00:31.441
and homemade bone broth for putting my meat back in

00:31.442 --> 00:34.921
some herbs, and letting that simmer for about four hours.

00:34.922 --> 00:37.381
Moved on to making my rough puff crust,

00:37.520 --> 00:40.560
let my heavy cream go until it separated from the way,

00:40.561 --> 00:44.201
set that aside, and then made my dough by combining some flour,

00:44.202 --> 00:45.301
salt, butter,

00:45.320 --> 00:46.200
and ice cold water

00:46.201 --> 00:48.961
and letting that sit in the fridge for about 20 minutes

00:48.962 --> 00:51.361
while I got started on my mashed potatoes.

00:51.362 --> 00:53.961
Put them in a large pot and let them boil on the stove

00:53.962 --> 00:57.541
while I made some brown sage butter to go inside my mash.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.920
Once my potatoes were done,

00:58.921 --> 01:01.121
I rice them, combine them with the butter,

01:01.122 --> 01:04.241
some heavy cream, season them with salt and pepper,

01:04.242 --> 01:05.681
and after about 20 minutes,

01:05.682 --> 01:09.481
I rolled out my pastry and kept folding the sides in,

01:09.482 --> 01:13.601
kept repeating that process until I was satisfied with how it looked.

01:13.602 --> 01:15.921
Popped that In the fridge for about 30 minutes.

01:15.922 --> 01:18.081
At this point, my stew was done.

01:18.082 --> 01:21.981
I put it in my pie dish, rolled out my pastry to go on top,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.240
made sure it was big enough to fit over it perfectly.

01:25.241 --> 01:26.841
Brush this with my egg wash,

01:26.842 --> 01:29.521
and popped in the oven for about 20 minutes.

01:29.522 --> 01:33.001
I also seasoned my Brussel sprouts and put them in the oven as well,

01:33.002 --> 01:37.541
and after about 20 minutes it was perfectly golden brown and flaky.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.040
Plated my pie with some mash and Brussel sprouts,

01:40.041 --> 01:42.262
and before I knew it, half of it was gone.
