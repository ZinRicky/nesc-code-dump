00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.880
Ever since the invention of GPS or Google Maps

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:04.360
Apple Maps whatever it may be

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:06.880
I have never had to ask for directions

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:08.440
Even if I don't have service

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.400
Drive somewhere where you do have service

00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:11.747
and then once you connect it usually stays on 

00:00:11.748 --> 00:00:12.655
until you get to your location
