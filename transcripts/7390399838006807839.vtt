00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.640
how did I get here and by here

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:05.440
I mean a homeschool mom before I can tell you

00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:08.240
we need to go back to where it all began

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:08.960
a few years ago

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:12.280
I was a classroom teacher and getting a master's degree in school administration

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:16.000
and that is when I Learned that schools were not created for kids

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.680
and I kind of Learned all of the ins and outs

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:20.440
things that happen behind the scenes

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:22.360
and I was not really a fan of it

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:23.760
throughout my entire teaching career

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:26.260
I had code teachers who are very pro homeschooling

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.520
I was not I was very pro school

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:30.580
but I had them in the back of my mind

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.600
fast forward to 2020 2021 school year

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.280
we all know what happened

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:38.360
and now I'm getting ready to put my kindergartener into a school

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:41.680
where they don't know what the next school year is going to look like

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:43.280
they don't know what mandates

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:46.520
and all of these things are going to look like for the next school year

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.300
so I was already hesitant

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.120
but my daughter was going to school

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:53.600
we signed up for a kindergarten tour at the same school where I taught

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:56.960
at the same school my husband had gone to elementary through high school

00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:58.240
this was our comfort zone

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:01.380
and we knew that this was going to be the best fit for our daughter

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.840
also at this time

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:04.140
there was some like

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.400
questionable moral stuff happening at schools

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.040
we all know what I'm talking about

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:12.880
but I just wasn't about to expose my daughter to all those things

00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:14.200
but it's a private Christian school

00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:15.800
we thought we weren't gonna deal with that

00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:19.080
except those are the exact conversations we heard from students

00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:20.860
while we were walking around on our tour

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.760
throughout the whole tour

00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:22.920
I'm kind of feeling uneasy

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:26.960
like I thought that this was 100% the option that we were going to choose

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:30.120
but something just in my spirit wasn't sitting right

00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:31.360
and I didn't know like

00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:32.960
I thought I was the only one failing this

00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:35.040
because I didn't wanna let go of my baby

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:39.120
I had been her mom and her teacher for five years now

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:41.840
and like I felt like maybe it was just me wanting to give up control

00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:44.800
but then we got in the car and the first words out of my husband's mouth were

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:46.260
I think you should homeschool

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.240
I looked at this man like he was nuts

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.160
I did not want to homeschool

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:53.800
I was like let's tour some other schools first

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:55.240
cause that's not on the table

00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:57.540
so we went home we prayed about it for

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.640
and also just a few days and I had Amy Morgan in the back of my mind homeschool

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:05.200
homeschool so here we are now

00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:06.480
I homeschool both my kids

00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:08.266
and it is the best thing that I have ever done
