00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
Yes, this is super recent.

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:05.041
This just happened. It's not even cleaned up yet.

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:07.501
And if. If everyone who watches this,

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.840
watch it all the way through. Look,

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:10.361
I'll show you all the damage to my car,

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:13.401
and if you watch the whole video over a minute,

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:15.541
it will help me pay for my deductible,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.140
because I am a single mom to four kids.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.200
The only thing I did to deserve this was

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:23.501
I let a homeless veteran move in with me.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.440
I was a bartender at a bar, actually.

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.481
He didn't put his ex wife down at the time.

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:29.641
He would say like, oh,

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:31.841
I have a disabled child.

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:34.441
I just wanted to make sure she would have the home

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:35.761
and her and the kids would be okay.

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:38.941
And I was fine being in between places.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.800
I just, you know,

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:42.201
I fell on my. On my ass of. Anyway,

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:45.801
fast forward to. I had a falling out with the roommate that I had.

00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:48.281
She left early. I had nobody to cover the rent,

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:48.641
and I was, like,

00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:50.861
in a tight spot, and I was like, fuck,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I didn't know what to do. I was.

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:52.561
And I was like, fuck.

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:53.121
It's either, like,

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:55.601
a total fucking stranger or somebody that I know

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:57.261
and I've known for a while.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.040
They're pretty good report with him.

00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.981
I see him out all the time.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.680
Uh, you know,

00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:06.261
maybe this could be a solution for both of us.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.040
And I asked him. I was Like, hey,

00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:08.921
I have a place, blah, blah.

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:10.361
Like, I know you're a dad,

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:11.161
you have kids. Like,

00:01:11.162 --> 00:01:12.281
we're in the same community,

00:01:12.282 --> 00:01:13.501
like, whatever.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.620
And I hated it.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.120
And so I think he also thought I was gonna sleep with him eventually,

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:20.281
and I didn't. Like,

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:22.121
I had a boyfriend then. I still have a boyfriend.

00:01:22.122 --> 00:01:23.701
That's the person I moved in with now.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.640
And I think he was just, like,

00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:25.961
really pissed that I never slept with him.

00:01:25.962 --> 00:01:28.421
I never did any of the things that he was hoping would happen.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.040
So I think he just has a lot of anger built up towards me.

00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:33.621
And so because I moved out,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.320
I only paid a portion of the rally.

00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:37.241
You can see the other video,

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:38.701
but, um,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.040
they even the claim suggestor was like, wow,

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:43.521
this is, like,

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:44.321
usually we'll see, like,

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:45.921
the street side busted.

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:48.321
For them to bust every single one of your windows

00:01:48.322 --> 00:01:50.041
the way that they did was, like,

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:51.781
really malicious. So

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.560
hopefully you made it through at least a minute of this video

00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:55.641
so I can pay my deductible.

00:01:55.642 --> 00:01:56.561
Thank you. I love you. Bye.
