00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.260
All of you are so sweet. And here's a small update

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.560
I had to pick up.

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:06.801
She's not allowed to bring her computer and stuff home,

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:08.521
so I had to. Since it's like a long weekend,

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:11.821
I had to go pick it up. So I got to see her today

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.040
and I was like, oh,

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.761
my god, I'm so sorry that I got the dates wrong.

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:16.801
But I remembered. I was like,

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:17.921
the reason I got the dates wrong

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:18.241
was cause

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:21.681
I remembered that today was the day that the results were coming out.

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:23.601
That's why Friday stuck out in my head.

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:25.121
So that's why I was reaching out to her.

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:26.201
And I do text her every day.

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:27.361
So I did talk to her yesterday.

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:28.201
I just didn't, like,

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:31.081
specifically wish her well on the thing.

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:33.121
And she still has a chance at getting apart.

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:36.401
It was just callbacks so she could still be cast in.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:36.841
Maybe, like,

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:39.481
a more minor role, I guess. Maybe.

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:40.841
I don't know. But it wasn't the end of the world.

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:41.961
And I did get to give her a big,

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:43.181
like, multiple.
