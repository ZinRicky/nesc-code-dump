00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.720
Christmas came early for me.

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:04.381
Thanks to Lowe's, I finally got a new sweeper.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.520
So I got this one off of their website.

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:09.641
I got a 10 Co I floor three complete,

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:13.081
which sweeps and mops your floor at the same time,

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:16.221
which is a game changer to me.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.360
It moves so nice, and it picks up everything.

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:20.921
As you can see. As you go forward,

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:22.881
it sweeps, and when you pull back,

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:26.401
it mops. I put it to the test behind my couch,

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:28.241
the dog hair accumulates.

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:30.401
It did a great job picking up all the dog hair

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:32.181
and mopping the floor clean.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.560
There was literally nothing left on the ground after I was done.

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:38.161
If you're looking for a new sweeper that is quick and easy to use,

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:39.841
I definitely recommend this one.

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:42.001
Look at all the nasty stuff it picked up.

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:46.261
Even the kids played in the Lowe's box hours after we got it.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.340
Thanks, lows.
