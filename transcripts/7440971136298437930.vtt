My sister flew in a week ago,

00:01.681 --> 00:05.361
and all she's been asking me to do is make her an apple crumble,

00:05.362 --> 00:08.001
and even though she's avoiding sugar and desserts right now,

00:08.002 --> 00:10.681
she said she would make an exception if I made her one.

00:10.682 --> 00:12.401
She didn't have to tell me that twice,

00:12.402 --> 00:14.321
and I decided to make her one.

00:14.322 --> 00:16.201
Cut up some Granny Smith apples,

00:16.202 --> 00:17.601
combined that with brown sugar,

00:17.602 --> 00:19.201
cornstarch, and some lemon.

00:19.202 --> 00:21.801
Set those aside while I got started on my crumble,

00:21.802 --> 00:23.121
which was just some flour,

00:23.122 --> 00:25.001
brown sugar, a pinch of salt,

00:25.002 --> 00:27.261
baking powder, some melted butter.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.480
Give that a stir until it was all crumbly

00:29.481 --> 00:31.561
before spreading it all over my apples

00:31.562 --> 00:33.681
and baking it for about 30 minutes.

00:33.682 --> 00:36.501
In the meantime, I got started on my crema glaze.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.160
Combine some heavy cream, milk, vanilla,

00:39.161 --> 00:41.161
a pinch of salt, and some sugar.

00:41.162 --> 00:42.561
Let that warm up on the stove

00:42.562 --> 00:44.681
and then tempered my egg yolks with it

00:44.682 --> 00:47.601
before putting it back on the stove and letting it thicken.

00:47.602 --> 00:49.481
I strained it through a fine mesh strainer

00:49.482 --> 00:52.001
and then placed it in the fridge so it was nice and cold

00:52.002 --> 00:54.481
with the warm apple pie. That was done,

00:54.482 --> 00:56.121
I pulled it out of the oven,

00:56.122 --> 00:58.881
and this made my kitchen smell so good.

00:58.882 --> 01:00.881
I put some of my vanilla cream down,

01:00.882 --> 01:05.273
the apple crumble on top. She kept coming back until all of it was gone.
