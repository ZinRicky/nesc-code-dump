00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.760
This is part two of the Ballerina Farms discussion.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.200
I would like to preface this video

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.480
because I know a lot of people love this account.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.480
That if I had $10 billion,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.200
I would live a similar life too.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.280
I don't even take issue with the fact

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.400
that she went 12 days postpartum to do,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.120
like a beauty pageant,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.840
because I know women in my real life

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.000
who had to be bridesmaids

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.520
like 7 days after giving birth,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.040
and they pulled that shit together too.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.720
And if you wanna live this, like,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.680
back to your roots,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.520
conservative

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.240
Christian values lifestyle,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.280
that's also fine.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.160
It's when an account goes from sharing their life

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.680
to marketing their lifestyle.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.880
I think a really good account

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.800
to show comparison of is Miriam,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.280
who shares her life as an Orthodox Jewish woman.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.080
Not once in my entire following of her

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.520
have I felt at all like she is selling or marketing

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.120
the Orthodox Jewish lifestyle.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.560
But these trad wife accounts,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.120
and I don't even think Ballerina Farm is like

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.640
the worst of

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.680
the worst of these at all.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.600
Is there selling a lifestyle based on an ideology

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.480
that can be harmful.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.940
And the ideology is the conservative religious,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.360
submissive wife narrative.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.140
And it is not an accident

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.160
that these sort of lifestyles are being glamorized

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.600
at the same historical moment

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.800
that our rights as women are being dialed back.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.440
Because they will not be stopping

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.920
with reproductive rights.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.220
The lifestyle that the trad wives are trying To sell

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.720
also require a husband signature

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.600
to open a bank account.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.260
Like, there has been this huge uptick

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.120
of conservative religious ideology being pushed.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.920
Be vigilant in what is being sold to you and why.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920
Because nothing happens in a vacuum,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.720
and nothing is by accident.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.900
And I know that sounds like conspiracy theory,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.200
but the writings

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.443
pretty much on the wall.
