00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.640
it's birthday season in my house

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:03.307
and it's just occurred to me that my 

00:00:03.308 --> 00:00:04.840
youngest girl has never had a cake

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:06.681
and considering she would have watched me 

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:08.040
baking cakes for everybody else

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.157
for the last few years 

00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:10.760
and yet never had one for herself

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:12.640
that just feels like an absolute tragedy

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:14.406
and to be totally honest I'm feeling like 

00:00:14.407 --> 00:00:15.920
the worst mum in the world right now

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:18.044
but she's my youngest and also sort of 

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:19.080
kind of an accident

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:20.560
and I don't harbour any resentment 

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:21.942
but you know what it's like when you get 

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:22.920
through all of the other kids

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.360
and you just kinda run out of energy

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:25.800
and she's always so good about it

00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:26.800
she doesn't even complain

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:28.480
so I just didn't think that she minded

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:30.421
not to mention she's got some interesting 

00:00:30.422 --> 00:00:32.040
dietary requirements to work around

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.480
which makes cake baking a whole lot more challenging

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:35.080
but today

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:36.545
we're gonna right some wrongs and 

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:37.882
put all of her favourite foods 

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:38.400
in one place

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:40.320
I started by boiling a potato and a kumera

00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:42.240
 before getting started on my cake batter

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.240
I piped on the frosting

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:45.840
and topped it with some crispy chicken fat and some peanut butter

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.737
and then it was time to sing Happy Birthday 

00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:48.600
to the birthday girl

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.920
this is Goldie she's our very excitable Hungarian vizsla 

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:52.962
and today she turns 3 

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:54.480
and while I was cutting the cake

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:56.262
she took off her hat and just opted for 

00:00:56.263 --> 00:00:57.600
the classic birthday suit look

00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:58.680
and the good thing about this cake

00:00:58.681 --> 00:00:59.600
Goldie is honestly

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.855
you don't need to share it 

00:01:00.856 --> 00:01:02.577
personally I didn't think that I had 

00:01:02.578 --> 00:01:04.160
baking a dog cake on my bingo card

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:05.534
but it made for one happy girl
