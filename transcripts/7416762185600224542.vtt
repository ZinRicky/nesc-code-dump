00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
They're really big, successful creators.

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:04.161
They always have this either in their hand over here,

00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:06.561
like clip to their hat or clip to their shirt.

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:09.161
I'm gonna show you why. I'm gonna plug it into my phone right now.

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:10.921
I'm not gonna stop the video at all.

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:15.981
I'm gonna plug it in and show you how it changes your audio. Listen.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.120
Okay, you hear me now?

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:29.701
Now watch how far I can walk away.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.980
Watch, I'm gonna keep.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.260
Actually, I can't walk backwards because it's a little hill,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.500
but watch, I'm gonna keep talking

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.020
and I think you can still see me.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.680
I think you can still see me,

00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:44.361
and I know you can still hear me,

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:47.961
cause that's how good this microphone works.

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:50.901
Watch, I'm gonna go all the way across the street.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.580
I think you can still see me.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.860
I'm over here. So if you're wanting to make better content,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.620
one of the easiest things you can do is get a microphone

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.140
so people can hear you

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.140
and you can be a little creative and not so stuck.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.462
It's like right here if you want one.
