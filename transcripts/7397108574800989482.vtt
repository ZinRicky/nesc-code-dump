00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.320
Home cooking is in freefall.

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:04.661
It's been declining since the mid 60s

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.840
as processed food has become more prominent and as fast food has.

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:11.321
It's really taken over our diets in America.

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:14.481
Rates of home cooking have fallen by half since the mid sixties.

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:15.641
And then you have the industry

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:18.641
with marketing messages that are implicitly telling us,

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:19.921
you don't have time to cook,

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:23.561
you're too important. A culture of home cooking was dismantled.

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:26.921
And I decided that the best way to encourage people to cook

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:30.401
was to remind them what a beautiful,

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:35.059
miraculous work it is. Eat anything you want, just cook it yourself.
