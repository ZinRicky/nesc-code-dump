00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.720
What I eat

00:00:00.721 --> 00:00:03.961
as a mom who's focused on optimal fertility and hormone health

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:05.641
and as someone who avoids seed oils,

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:06.641
artificial sugars,

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:08.521
dyes, and preservatives at all costs.

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:11.281
Pasture raised raw yolks and eggs for cholesterol and choline,

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.241
which are vital for baby's brain development.

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:16.181
Next, the most nutrient dense food on earth liver,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.080
which is rich in folate and vitamin A

00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:19.841
and necessary for the birth of a healthy,

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:20.881
well developed baby.

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:22.961
I like to take birthright on a daily basis

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:25.801
because it's the only real food supplement that contains raw,

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:26.601
freeze dried liver

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:29.401
from regeneratively farmed cows that graze on lush pasture

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:30.121
free of hormones,

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:32.021
pesticides, Gmos, and glyphosate.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.920
In addition, my meals focus around pasture raised meats

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.481
which are rich in amino acids,

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:37.881
essential fat soluble vitamins,

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:38.921
iron, and protein.

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.921
I use leftover bones to make gelatinous

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:42.921
rich bone broths which are especially nourishing,

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:46.161
and I use broths to cook sprouted grains and to make soups with

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:47.241
when making bread.

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:50.041
I always source organically grown grains and stone,

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:52.401
trying them immediately before souring and fermenting

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:53.601
to pre digest the grain

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:56.641
and make vitamins more bioavailable to my body.

00:00:56.642 --> 00:00:59.121
I eat sauerkraut often for its probiotics

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:01.561
which contribute to a healthy gut microbiome.

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:05.681
And I prioritize pasture fats which are rich in fat soluble vitamins A,

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:07.201
D, E, and K2.

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:10.401
And lastly, raw dairy from grass grazed cows,

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:11.641
especially when cultured,

00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:14.747
is a superfood and I incorporate it into my daily diet.
