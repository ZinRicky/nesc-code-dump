00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.440
My kids have never eaten Mac and cheese before,

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:04.401
so I figured it was time to make them some.

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:05.841
Between business calls and meetings,

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:08.321
I only had a brief period of time to make the pasta,

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:10.681
so I use this opportunity to get my dough started.

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:13.041
I'm using iron corn, the most primitive form of wheat

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.761
that's known to be tolerable to those with gluten intolerances.

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:17.241
It's glyphosate and GMO free,

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:19.521
and it's regeneratively farmed by a family in Idaho.

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:20.921
I'm rolling dough in a little balls,

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:22.801
then dropping them into my pasta attachment,

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:25.241
which gives me fresh whole grain elbow pasta.

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:28.201
It's a quick, non stop process that gives me several cups worth.

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:29.761
After finishing with the pasta making,

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.401
I leave them to dry in a dishcloth

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:33.641
while I run out to pick my kids up from school.

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:34.401
When we get back home,

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:37.121
I create the cheese sauce with a combination of sharp cheddar

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:38.961
and Parmesan oregano cheeses.

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:41.761
The cheese sauce is slowly thickened by drizzling and raw milk

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:42.881
while stirring constantly.

00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:44.161
This process doesn't take long,

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:47.441
and midway through, I add my fresh elbow pasta to a pot of salted

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:50.241
boiling water to cook for four to five minutes until all done.

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:51.801
Tea I add the grated cheeses,

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:55.241
a pinch of salt, and the cooked macaroni pasta to the saucepan.

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:56.481
I stir to combine well

00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:59.241
and then dish up each of my children a bowl of macaroni and cheese

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:00.781
for their after school snack.
