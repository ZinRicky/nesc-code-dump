00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.720
I'm up late canning Turkey broth from Thanksgiving.

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:04.241
It's been sitting on the stove for days,

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:06.001
and out of nowhere, I run out of propane,

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:06.881
which I knew was running out

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:08.441
because I started smelling the propane,

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:11.081
which is not the propane. It's like a chemical they add in.

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:13.901
Anyway, this electric canner has saved my broth.
