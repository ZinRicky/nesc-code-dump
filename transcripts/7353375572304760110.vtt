00:00.080 --> 00:03.360
We were out and about running errands and needed an afternoon snack,

00:03.361 --> 00:05.401
so we decided to get some tacos.

00:05.402 --> 00:06.481
Lucky's favorite food,

00:06.482 --> 00:08.321
and I'm slowly getting around to them.

00:08.322 --> 00:12.601
So we placed our order and obviously also had to get a large horchata.

00:12.602 --> 00:15.281
I've been craving these so much this pregnancy,

00:15.282 --> 00:16.721
so we always get one.

00:16.722 --> 00:18.161
Then when our food was done,

00:18.162 --> 00:19.921
we brought it over to the table,

00:19.922 --> 00:24.361
and I usually get an al pastor torta and then two al pastor tacos,

00:24.362 --> 00:26.121
while lucky got two tortas,

00:26.122 --> 00:27.481
three al pastor tacos,

00:27.482 --> 00:28.761
and five steak tacos.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.841
I don't know what it is with him and his limes,

00:30.842 --> 00:35.161
but he uses so many limes and needs all the hot sauce he can get.

00:35.162 --> 00:38.681
Need to eat mine while it's piping hot and the cheese is all melty.

00:38.682 --> 00:39.721
It is so good,

00:39.722 --> 00:43.361
you guys. Soft but crunchy bread and the savoriness of it.

00:43.362 --> 00:44.481
Absolutely divine.

00:44.482 --> 00:46.241
The horchata is perfect with it.

00:46.242 --> 00:48.921
I don't know what it is with this specific brand of soda,

00:48.922 --> 00:50.281
but every flavor I've tried,

00:50.282 --> 00:51.781
I absolutely hated.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.600
Had to add extra onion and cilantro to mine.

00:54.601 --> 00:56.361
Tried it with the other salsa.

00:56.362 --> 00:57.921
Also made lucky try mine,

00:57.922 --> 00:59.521
so I always want him trying my food,

00:59.522 --> 01:00.521
and he really liked it.

01:00.522 --> 01:02.401
And then I finished off with my tacos

01:02.402 --> 01:05.461
after lucky had been done for a very long time already,

01:05.560 --> 01:08.680
I was craving this very specific lime and basil ice cream,

01:08.681 --> 01:10.121
so we got that as well.

01:10.122 --> 01:11.241
I couldn't Make up my mind.

01:11.242 --> 01:13.201
So I tried at least five different flavors

01:13.202 --> 01:15.081
and decided to go with strawberry,

01:15.082 --> 01:16.098
lime and passion fruit.
