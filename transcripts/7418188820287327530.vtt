00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.160
did you know that you can do a behind the scenes tour

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:03.520
of the living on the Land Pavilion

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:05.440
in Epcot as a homeschooling family

00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:08.800
I love to incorporate educational activities into our Disney days

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:12.040
and this was a tour that I have been dying to do for a long time now

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:15.640
you have to book your tour ahead of time and it is an additional cost per person

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.060
but in my opinion it was a highlight of our trip

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.240
we met our tour guide right next to the Thorn Ride in the land Pavilion

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:24.000
and then we got to go behind the scenes and look at the greenhouses

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.640
and see how all the Disney Imagineers created innovative growing techniques

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:30.640
as avid gardeners and lovers of nature

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:32.400
this was such an incredible experience

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:35.880
we brought our nine and eight year old because this would count as earth science

00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.760
because in my opinion

00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:39.160
there's no better way to learn something than being able to touch

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:40.680
see and feel it for yourself

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:44.000
the tour was about an hour and took you through three different rooms

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.560
showing you the growing techniques that Disney has come up with

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:48.940
and ways that they've innovated growth techniques

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.080
and share that technology with the world

00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:53.960
one of my favourite things we saw was the hydroponic lettuce system

00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:56.840
that they were growing for some of the restaurants here in Disney World

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:57.440
later in the trip

00:00:57.441 --> 00:01:00.600
my husband and I actually got to eat a salad at Tiffin's Restaurant

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:03.280
in Animal Kingdom where they grow all the lettuces for

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:04.560
and in true Disney fashion

00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:06.640
our tour guide was funny entertaining

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:09.400
and informative he explained why they grow the plants they do

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.760
and specifically with the salad

00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:12.800
why they use different lettuce varieties

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:15.880
my husband is a big gardening aficionado and loves to tinker

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:17.440
so seeing the trellis systems

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:21.640
and how they grow such large quantities of vegetables in such small spaces

00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:23.040
keeping the fruit off the ground

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:27.040
and keeping pests at the minimum gave him tons of ideas for our Home Garden

00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:29.400
the tour group was only about 10 people

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:31.480
so everybody got to ask questions

00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:34.420
and really interact with the tour guide along the tour

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.520
everyone forgets that Disney is also an innovator in so many industries

00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:41.880
including ecology and environmental conservation

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.600
the work that they're doing with ecology and conservation

00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:46.440
and specifically in the land Pavilion

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:48.140
was so cool to see up close

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.320
our kids favourite part was definitely when we went inside

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:52.120
to see the tanks full of tilapia

00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:55.880
and learn about why they are the perfect fish to farm in close quarters

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:58.480
we actually also got to see a lot of the boats coming through

00:01:58.481 --> 00:01:59.960
for the living off the land ride

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:01.840
and then feed the tilapia and help

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:04.600
we truly became part of someone's Disney experience

00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:08.180
I highly recommend this behind the scenes Disney experience for your next trip
