00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.960
What are you gonna do as a stay at home mom all day?

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.721
Those people are people that have never been around children

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:08.601
to understand how much work children are.

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:12.681
Not only that, what it takes to keep a home tidy is a lot of work.

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:14.481
Yeah. Now a lot of women feel shame around this,

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:15.761
which is just so sad. They go,

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:16.961
I wanna be a housewife.

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:19.121
You wanna even know what their own fathers will tell them?

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:20.641
What are you gonna do all day?

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:22.841
Idiots say that. People who've never actually understood

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:24.321
what it takes to build a household

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:25.401
and to have. By the way,

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:29.041
the next strong generation is a present mother who's in the home

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:31.621
building one cause. In the home is where you build a family.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.080
There's a family, there's the individual.

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:34.223
And that's what can change the world.
