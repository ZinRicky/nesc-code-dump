00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Okay, like crafts and kids and shit is fun,

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:08.781
but like life is fun too. I just say life in general is better.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.340
It's like Rocky and hard at first,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.840
but it's kind of exciting cause it's yours

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:16.481
and you get to like make all the decisions and stuff.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.481
And that's also kind of scary at first too,

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:19.321
cause you're like, oh my god,

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:20.721
I haven't had to make a decision.

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:23.641
Somebody has just told me what to buy for 10 years,

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:24.901
17 years. Well,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.140
but I don't know, it's so much better.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.760
Because here's what sucks.

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:33.441
You go from being like someone's daughter,

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:35.761
so you have your dad who's always telling you what to do,

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:37.361
whether he's nicer, you know what I mean?

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:39.581
Like I didn't have a shitty relationship with my dad,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.760
had a pretty good relationship with my dad.

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:47.721
And you go from like your parents house to then the

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:48.701
your husband.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.480
You just always have somebody like in your shit and it's annoying.

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:56.321
And I didn't even go from one to the other.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:59.241
Like I did go to college and I had a little bit of life experience.

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:00.521
I think that's what made it even worse.

00:01:00.522 --> 00:01:04.581
I had a taste of freedom. I had my rum Springer.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.960
I went and experienced life,

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:07.241
not like this is fucking fun.

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:08.001
And then I was like, okay,

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:09.601
I gotta do the responsible thing

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:12.181
and settle down and get married and have kids.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.340
And then I did. And then I Was like,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.980
so all that fun shit stops,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.580
like, I don't get to do that anymore,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.740
huh?

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.240
Okay, like,

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:26.161
crafts and kids and shit is fun,

00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:29.221
but like, life is fun too.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.500
All that other stuff is fun too,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.480
because you get to a point where you've like,

00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:35.081
made all the new recipes you're gonna make,

00:01:35.082 --> 00:01:36.241
you've baked all the fucking bread,

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:37.441
you've done all the fucking crafts.

00:01:37.442 --> 00:01:38.281
Especially we start having like,

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:39.221
multiple kids,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.620
we've been to the library programs,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
I've seen the birds, I've seen the rockets,

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:51.541
we've built the solar microwave ovens,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.680
and you're like, is this really life?

00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:59.781
It's been 10 years of this.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.500
Is this life?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.000
And then it's wild, cause as your kids start to grow

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:09.401
and you start to see that they're starting to have these experiences,

00:02:09.402 --> 00:02:11.441
you. There is a feeling of like,

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:15.461
why did my life have to stop just because they're started?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.020
That doesn't seem,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.080
ah, just doesn't seem right.

00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:23.021
It doesn't sit right in my soul.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.380
So I don't know. Five years after divorce,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.900
I, uh.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.740
10 out of 10, highly recommend.
