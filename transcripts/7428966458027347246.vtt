00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.440
Can someone track down the women

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:05.881
Kamala Harris says are bleeding out in parking lots

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:08.301
because Roe v. Wade was overturn?

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.400
Yeah, they're right here.

00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:12.481
Amber Thurman needed a DNC

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:13.481
after abortion

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:16.741
medication didn't completely dispel the remains of her pregnancy.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.400
Georgia's new abortion law made doctors hesitate,

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:22.001
fearing prosecution. 20 hours of delay,

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.961
the infection spread. Amber died.

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:26.361
Candy Miller, a mother of three from Georgia,

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:29.961
faced an unintended pregnancy in 2022.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.561
Due to Georgia's abortion ban,

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.081
she couldn't get the care she needed.

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:34.781
Despite her life threatening conditions,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.080
she attempted to end the pregnancy herself,

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.941
leading to severe complications.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.840
And these are just a couple of stories.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.721
This is the reality in America today.

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:48.661
No one deserves to be left in a parking lot bleeding

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.400
simply because they needed an abortion and reproductive care.

00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:56.421
And I'm sure that you, regardless of your political affiliation,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.120
agree to. I believe in a future where medical care is a right,

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:01.681
but we need to show up for it.

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:04.101
Vote for repro rights November 5th.
