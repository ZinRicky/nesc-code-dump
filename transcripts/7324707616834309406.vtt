00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.520
I wasn't aware there was a third person in my marriage.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.520
But please tell me again

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.420
how you know for a fact everything is his.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.040
Know for a fact that I don't have a job.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.140
And know for a fact that I don't have any job.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.240
Anything his name is on,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.520
my name is also on.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.080
I don't technically have a typical 9 to 5,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.400
but, you know,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.460
what I do have is some side hustles.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.040
I know I'm not naive to think enough

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.080
that a side hustle is going to sustain me

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.740
if my husband would ever leave, not when.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.560
And I do have multiple skills and jobs in my past

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.940
that I always use.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.120
Think. I don't care if you say this kind of thing

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.920
of make sure you have a backup plan

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.040
or when he leaves you,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.140
as long as we're saying the same thing to career women,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.120
because career women can also be left.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.240
They can also lose jobs.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.300
They can also have the worst thing

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.000
possible happen to them in their lives,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.040
and they'd still be okay,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.060
because women are resilient.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.700
Feminism is just not about choice,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.600
and it's never been about choice.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.240
So let's stop pretending feminism's about choice,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.880
because y'all act like this.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.440
That choice feminism,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.760
and it's never been about choice,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.957
and it never will be about choice.
