00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.720
I will never get over the moral superiority of people

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:06.040
who are actively forcing children to give birth

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:07.600
and perform reproductive labor

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:09.400
for their abusers and for the government

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:12.840
these people who are not troubled by the fact that women across the country

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.660
are describing themselves as walking coffins

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.760
because their government

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:20.560
will not allow them to terminate their non viable pregnancy

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:23.280
why doesn't the government force everybody to give their organs

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:26.680
for all of the children who die waiting on the organ donor list every year

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:28.520
why don't we force everybody who can

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:31.360
to give blood at their annual preventative checkups

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:32.560
why don't we do those things

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:36.340
you can't even take organs from a dead person

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.560
these are real people with complicated pregnancies

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:41.960
with complicated lives with dreams

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:43.640
with facts that you don't know

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:45.960
this moral superiority of sitting on your couch

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:48.840
and getting on your keyboard and shaming people

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:49.560
meanwhile

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:55.840
you are inflicting serious harm on millions of women throughout the country

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:59.400
yeah the times we are living in are utterly barbaric

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:01.092
I completely agree with you on that
