00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.320
Okay, so did you know that doodling is truly good for your brain?

00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.841
Harvard Medical School did a study.

00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:08.681
These are my favorite markers to doodle with

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:11.701
because they come in like a neat little carrying case

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.720
and it comes with a bajillion colors

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:15.761
and they have a broad side and a fine tip.

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:18.121
But doodling can help, like,

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.521
release some of the extra,

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:21.521
like, psychological stress in your brain.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:24.441
Cause your brain wants to make sense of things.

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:27.161
It wants to everything to kinda line up and make sense,

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:29.721
but that's not how life necessarily works.

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:33.761
And so doodling can sometimes help your brain fill those gaps somehow.

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:35.901
Like they've done studies with EEG's.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.880
I don't know, it's really interesting.

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:40.361
So I hope you doodle some more in your life.

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:42.701
