00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm unwilling to become pregnant

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.640
if I don't have unrestricted access to healthcare

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:15.240
and that includes abortion rights

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.120
and if any part of you is thinking they won't

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.080
I live in a blue state I live in Minnesota

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:22.400
they won't enact a national abortion ban

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:25.920
they've literally been planning this for 50 years

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.000
they haven't denied it

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:31.260
they have both indicated that they would like to enact a national abortion ban

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.280
Vance tried to reframe it the other night by saying well

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.000
it's not really a national abortion ban

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:41.020
I'm just an advocate for national minimum standards

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.240
that's the exact same thing as an abortion ban

00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:46.240
saying that throughout the country

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:49.240
you can't get an abortion past six weeks

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:52.720
15 weeks whatever arbitrary number they come up with

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:58.620
maternal mortality rate in Texas alone has jumped 56%

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.200
one part of it is obviously fear right

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:04.840
I don't wanna become pregnant and need emergency healthcare

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:06.400
and not be able to receive it and

00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:08.920
or die but another part of it is like

00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:14.900
if what my government sees me is as a reproductive vessel who doesn't have um

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.900
her own free will control over her body

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.260
know what she needs have her own destiny that is valued

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.240
then I don't wanna give you what you

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:27.772
I'm not gonna do that I really don't wanna do reproductive labor for you
