00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.400
If your a guy and your girl seems a little crazy

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:04.102
here's what you can say 

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:06.720
No. one “what do you need for me I'm here”

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.872
No. two “I'm taking space but I promise I'll be back”

00:00:09.873 --> 00:00:11.240
If you’re in a relationship then

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:13.220
you know that you guys don't always agree

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.080
instead of acting in the heat of the moment and

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.253
you have to walk away 

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:18.120
But storming off isn't gonna help either

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:22.360
No. 3 “I'm sorry for X, I'll be mindful next time”

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:23.880
If your partner says something upset them

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.320
then you should listen to them and acknowledge it

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:30.554
No. 4 “your thoughts matter to me, tell me more”

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:34.920
 it's soo so important that you listen to your partner and they feel understood

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:38.600
No. 5 “I was wrong, how can I make this right?”

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:41.060
So many people apologize for the mistakes they make

00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:44.247
but forget to ask for a solution for the problem

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.720
No. 6 “I'm on your side”

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:49.440
remember that you guys are a team

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:51.520
so you should be fighting the conflict

00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:52.748
not each other 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.680
If you’re a man or if you're a woman

00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:58.400
Saying these phrases will have a big impact on your relationship

00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.280
Try this with your partner

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.580
if you want a deeper connection!
