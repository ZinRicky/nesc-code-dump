00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.560
I had a weird experience this weekend

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:05.360
that makes me believe I kind of understand empty nest syndrome a little bit more

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:06.560
I have three little kids

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:07.880
and I homeschool my two older ones

00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:10.080
so my house is never devoid of children

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:13.560
I have zero time in my house when the kids are not also at home

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.460
but my parents took all three kids for the weekend this weekend

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.920
and at first

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:19.640
my husband and I were so psyched that we're gonna get the house alone

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:20.400
because you know

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.100
we have these beautiful spaces

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.920
but we never get to like

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.040
cook and relax and like

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:25.320
actually sit on our couch

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:26.560
so that was our plan for the weekend

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:29.280
that's all we planned on doing is just hanging out and relaxing

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:33.960
tell me why it was so difficult to actually relax in a big empty house

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:37.360
it's almost like all of the stresses and anxieties and like

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:39.720
compulsions that you have within your house

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.560
while you're taking care of kids still there

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:43.440
you just have this like

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:45.440
phantom anxiety that the kids aren't there

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:47.360
so although all day every day

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:49.480
we look at our beautiful space and they're like oh

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.520
I wish we could sit and enjoy these

00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:53.800
when we actually got the opportunity

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:55.120
it was jarring

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.920
and I think that's why empty nest feels so weird

00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:59.326
cause your body's used to the chaos
