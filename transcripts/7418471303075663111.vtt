00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
Mila Kunas has allegedly moved out of the home she shares another day

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:08.040
another celebrity listed in conjunction with the P

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.980
Diddy case why do men continue to cover up and protect each other

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.920
even and especially when it involves cases of horrific violence against women

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:19.960
Doctor Zoe and I wanna talk about how

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:27.380
and why men use and rely on one another to cover up violence against women

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:36.060
so Dominic Pelicot over in France has played guilty to drugging and

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.300
graping his wife over a period of 10 years inviting

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.160
facilitating over the internet random men to come over and her

00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.720
obviously the acts are horrendous

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:52.180
but I think what's really struck a cord with people

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.360
is the silent and complicity of all of the men

00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:01.260
however many there were none of which spoke up

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.440
none of which who reported him or said anything

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:09.180
in order for this abuse to continue over 10 years

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.260
this kind of mutual silence

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.320
this agreed upon code was relied upon between these men

00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:22.000
and it's not that different from what's happening here

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:28.980
this case has also raised questions about how men use this abuse of power

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.300
to ensure that they create a network of silence and shame from their survivors

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.860
to continue to perpetrate abuse

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.340
they develop these networks of power and influence

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.500
in order to evade accountability for their actions

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.120
in order to continue to perpetrate

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:58.080
we've seen so many stories come to light about how different celebrities

00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:59.560
and people with wealth

00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:06.060
and people with influence have been involved or roped in to this network

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.460
and somehow most of them have been silenced

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.940
last week the research came out that nearly one in 10 men in New South Wales

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.700
have faced legal action over domestic or family violence

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.700
those are just the ones that have faced legal action

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.940
one in 10

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.080
we know that the same amount of Australian men have had with under eighteens

00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:35.500
we also know that research that found that one in three men would

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.500
if they knew that there were no consequences to their actions

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.780
which again explains things like this and cases like this

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.640
men not only commit these acts

00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:49.560
but depend on the silence and complicity of other men to do so

00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:52.020
the more wealthy connected and powerful they are

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.320
the more effectively they can do this

00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:57.140
all men benefit from the system of silence

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.380
this is why survivors struggle to get justice

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.200
and if you think this doesn't affect you

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:07.220
ask yourself how many men do you think are in your community

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.100
who are staying silent in order to allow other men to continue to perpetrate
