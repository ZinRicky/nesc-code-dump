00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
Okay, what is with the term body count?

00:02.161 --> 00:05.241
Does anybody else feel like it's just a little bit icky?

00:05.242 --> 00:06.241
Anybody? Your meaning

00:06.242 --> 00:07.281
to tell me that

00:07.282 --> 00:11.121
we have normalized talking about people we have been intimate with

00:11.122 --> 00:13.401
as nothing more than bodies?

00:13.402 --> 00:14.601
I don't know, maybe it's just me,

00:14.602 --> 00:18.041
but whenever I hear a person described as a body,

00:18.042 --> 00:20.841
I instantly think of the process of death.

00:20.842 --> 00:22.041
You know, after somebody dies,

00:22.042 --> 00:23.921
you talk about, they're going to bury the body,

00:23.922 --> 00:25.561
they're gonna cremate the body.

00:25.562 --> 00:28.121
It's like a way of acknowledging that there is no soul,

00:28.122 --> 00:31.921
there's no spirit inside of that body is just flesh and bones.

00:31.922 --> 00:33.561
So to see that same language

00:33.562 --> 00:36.481
used to describe somebody that you have been intimate with,

00:36.482 --> 00:38.041
that you have done the most personal and,

00:38.042 --> 00:41.041
dare I say, sacred thing that you could ever do with somebody,

00:41.042 --> 00:42.761
it just seems so sad and dehumanizing.

00:42.762 --> 00:45.601
I feel like it says a lot about what our culture thinks,

00:45.602 --> 00:47.081
intimacy and sex,

00:47.082 --> 00:49.481
and especially what hook up culture thinks of those things.

00:49.482 --> 00:51.761
That a lot of times when you participate in hook up culture,

00:51.762 --> 00:55.881
they really do view you as nothing more than flesh and bones.

00:55.882 --> 00:59.161
A lot of people would say that a high body count is a big red flag,

00:59.162 --> 01:00.201
and sure, maybe it is.

01:00.202 --> 01:01.841
But I also think you should pay attention

01:01.842 --> 01:04.881
to the way somebody talks about the people that they have slept with.

01:04.882 --> 01:06.641
And if they're referring to them as Bodies.

01:06.642 --> 01:08.156
I think that's also a red flag.
