00:00.080 --> 00:01.320
I feel like it is so funny

00:01.320 --> 00:04.020
when women wanna prove that they can do what men can do.

00:04.080 --> 00:06.560
And to me, it is so funny because I'm like, no, thanks.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.700
Do I wanna change the oil in my car?

00:08.880 --> 00:11.620
Absolutely not. Like, no.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.440
Do I wanna do a car wash?

00:13.440 --> 00:15.400
No. Do I wanna change a tire?

00:15.400 --> 00:16.440
Absolutely not.

00:16.440 --> 00:17.680
Like, those are things

00:17.680 --> 00:19.400
I don't even wanna prove to you that I could do that,

00:19.400 --> 00:20.620
because even if I could,

00:20.920 --> 00:21.760
I don't wanna do that.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.940
I'll be inside taking care of the babies,

00:24.120 --> 00:25.080
baking bread,

00:25.080 --> 00:25.720
making food,

00:25.720 --> 00:27.220
cleaning the windows,

00:27.240 --> 00:29.300
like, laying outside on a hammock.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.680
I'm sorry, but it's just funny.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.060
Like, it's not a flex.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.360
And to me, us as women

00:35.360 --> 00:38.040
already being able to carry babies,

00:38.040 --> 00:39.080
like, have a.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.860
Be pregnant, um,

00:41.040 --> 00:42.680
just be able to, like,

00:42.680 --> 00:45.640
have. Use our hands to cook and make bread

00:45.640 --> 00:46.760
and make food delicious

00:46.760 --> 00:50.760
and nourish our families and nurture babies. Like, to me,

00:50.760 --> 00:54.500
that is such a wonderful gift that I don't even look at,

00:54.600 --> 00:56.080
like, oh, as we

00:56.080 --> 00:57.580
as women cannot do,

00:58.120 --> 00:59.320
change a tire or whatever.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.800
Like, I don't even look at that

01:00.800 --> 01:03.820
because we already have such a wonderful gift

01:03.880 --> 01:06.860
as women that god gave us that.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.200
Why would I focus on what I can't do?

01:09.200 --> 01:11.560
Like, I'm gonna focus on my god given gift

01:11.560 --> 01:12.860
and I'm gonna embrace that.
