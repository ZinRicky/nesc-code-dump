00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
I actually got this at an antique store,

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:04.881
so this is a vintage one. They are hard to find.

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:07.521
I have not found a bread cutter that can cut sourdough like this.

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:10.161
Cuts it all uniformly and it's super easy to cut.

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:13.001
I absolutely don't like cutting sourdough bread with a bread knife,

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:14.321
and I do not like the bow knives

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:16.361
as it does not cut the actual bottom of the bread.

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:18.821
Bow knives look pretty, but they are not very useful.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.920
This cuts the bread so smoothly.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.121
Even the end piece right here,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.561
it just cuts it perfectly.

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:25.601
I added the link here for you for a new one

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:27.144
as the vintage ones are hard to find.
