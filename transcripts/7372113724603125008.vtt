00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.564
so this is a story all about how my lounge 

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:03.200
got flipped

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.709
turned upside down and if you'd like to 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.200
take a minute

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.177
just sit right there and I'll tell you about 

00:00:07.178 --> 00:00:07.880
how I painted it

00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:08.870
six different colours

00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:09.720
 and unfortunately

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:11.840
I'm not even talking about these test pots

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:13.915
I'm talking about how I genuinely tried and 

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:15.520
committed to six different colours

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:17.440
before finding the right combination

00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:19.499
the first thing you should know is I'm an idiot 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.800
clearly

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.040
and the second thing you should know is this took 6 months

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:23.709
I started with this half of the room and

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.920
 I clearly painted it mustard

00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:27.040
bold fkn choice. I don't hate it at this point tho

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:30.000
and then I turned around and saw this in the other half of the room

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:30.960
and I thought hell

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:32.920
my mental health is already unstable

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:34.840
why not push it and try and get this room done

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:36.676
I don't know 5 days before Christmas 

00:00:36.677 --> 00:00:37.520
and spoiler alert

00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:39.040
we did not make the Christmas deadline

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:40.520
I don't know why I'm surprised

00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:43.440
and as a mother of three I don't even know why I tried

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:45.920
I did manage to seal the walls so that they didn't look so

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:46.960
I don't know hideous

00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:49.640
the day before 25 people came to my house for Christmas

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.440
hands up if you’re also always the host

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:54.880
and then this I'm ashamed to say this is New Year's Eve

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:55.920
looking back at this footage

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:58.920
I can't help but laugh like what the fk was I actually up to

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:01.240
I should say as well this is never seen before footage

00:01:01.241 --> 00:01:03.200
and there's a reason it's never been seen before

00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:03.920
and that is because

00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:07.280
I was immediately filled with deep regret over my decision making

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:09.506
so this room actually this whole house is very 

00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:10.880
Mid century and as you can see

00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:12.160
there's a panel that divides

00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:14.560
like the top third of the room from the rest of the room

00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:17.480
and I really like it when people paint their ceilings an interesting colour

00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:18.080
and I thought

00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:21.360
maybe I could be one of those interesting people with interesting ceilings

00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:24.560
and I've gotta say mustard is about as interesting as it gets

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:26.720
and obviously white wouldn't have looked any good with it

00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:28.480
side note nothing would have look up with it

00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:31.440
so I ended up complimenting that bold mustard with this soft

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:32.640
kind of limoncello colour

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:34.960
by the way this is no shade at the paint or the colours

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.200
they are absolutely lovely

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.560
it just wasn't lovely placement on my behalf

00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:41.360
looking back on it now it was definitely a vibe like it does look cool

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:43.920
it looks like a cool retro TV set but living in it

00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:46.200
it was maybe a bit much for this room anyway

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:49.000
because I have since realised that this room is actually a fkn

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.120
nightmare to work with I'm not sure if you've noticed

00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:53.360
but there are a lot of different things going on in this room

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:56.640
there's two different spaces, a lot of little surfaces, built in shelves

00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:57.840
like there's just a lot going on

00:01:57.841 --> 00:01:58.800
but when it comes to paint

00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:00.764
I subscribe to the philosophy that you should 

00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:01.960
absolutely push the boat out

00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:03.720
and try something new and if you don't like it

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:05.280
you can just cut your losses and change it

00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:06.880
it's pretty cheap pretty accessible

00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:07.860
and it's a fun DIY 

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.440
I'm telling myself that to make myself feel better

00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:12.600
but seriously I'm just so fkn sick of white

00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:15.160
she says as she has just finished painting the walls white

00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:16.080
and to be totally honest

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:18.440
painting the mustard out of this room did make me a bit sad

00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:20.240
but it just wasn't working in the other area

00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:22.440
and considering these two spaces are connected

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:24.640
it's got to be cohesive so it's gotta go

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:27.080
and so I sampled and my little mind boggled

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:28.720
turns out I'm quite indecisive

00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:30.760
generally though I'm not that indecisive

00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:33.000
I swear it's just the curse of this room anyway

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:34.240
so I sampled another colour

00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:36.080
this is Potter's Park by Dulux

00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:39.360
and I absolutely love it but did I love it here in this particular space

00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:40.160
no I did not

00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:42.160
I would like to put it anywhere else

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.404
just not here maybe in my daughter's bedroom 

00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:46.000
or maybe even the creepy laundry

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:48.040
so once I had successfully made a bad room worse

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:50.000
by painting random swatches all over it

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:52.320
so that it closely resembled the inside of my brain

00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:53.160
ha ha messy

00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:54.680
I made the executive decision

00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:57.080
to boss my husband into painting everything white

00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:58.960
and it stayed like this for quite a while actually

00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:00.120
I needed a beat okay

00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:01.360
this room had traumatised me

00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.040
and I lost all my confidence in colour

00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:04.520
but then one day recently

00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:06.440
I thought I'd try again I thought I'd try this one

00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:07.920
and I thought this one might be the one

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.920
her name is Ponsonby she is from Dulux

00:03:09.921 --> 00:03:11.880
and she is stunning as stunning as she is

00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:12.920
I mean they're all stunning

00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:14.280
but I just I wasn't feeling it

00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:15.920
so now we're on to colour No. 6

00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:17.627
and I’ll have to let you know how we go in the next part
