00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.960
women have been lied to,

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:04.841
and the worst part is it's .coming from other women

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:07.141
The belief that “if he wanted to he would”

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.376
that's actually the worst advice 

00:00:09.377 --> 00:00:10.081
We hear it all the time

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:12.141
and it's literally a joke at this point.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.400
so I asked my dad,

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:16.261
uncle, and brother what they thought about this,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.100
and their response genuinely surprised me.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.000
Their response was it's simply not true

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.281
because most of the time

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:23.996
they literally don't know. 

00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:26.601
Unless you're direct and communicate your needs,

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:27.721
they don't understand this,

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:28.401
half the time

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:31.290
they don't understand how to meet your needs

00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:31.881
Not only that

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:35.941
some men have never been given examples of how to treat a woman properly

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.520
they're figuring out life

00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:38.644
just like we are 

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:40.101
The saying should really go

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.837
“if you want him to, you should tell him” 

00:00:42.838 --> 00:00:45.741
Directly, and I mean directly as possible

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.034
You want him to text you “good morning beautiful”? 

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:48.561
TELL HIM to!

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:51.541
if you want him to get you flowers, tell him to!

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.640
if you want him to grab you coffee in the morning

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:56.701
or just surprise you in general, tell him to!

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.080
want him to pump your gas?

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:01.101
then tell him directly and tell them your needs

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.000
Don’t wait later down the road and compare your relationship with other people

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:06.081
for all you know

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:09.141
they're probably just really good at communicating their wants and needs

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.660
How do we expect them to know if we don't tell them?

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.760
Take initiative and speak directly

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.321
if you want your man to surprise you with gifts,

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:18.921
flowers, or do pleasant things for you.

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:20.121
If you want your needs met,

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:21.301
speak directly,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.580
communicate, it's that simple.
