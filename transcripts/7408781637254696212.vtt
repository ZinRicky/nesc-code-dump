00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.360
one of my favourite pastimes

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:03.063
is to come up with new ways to trick my 

00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:04.640
children into eating their vegetables

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:05.510
and would you believe

00:00:05.511 --> 00:00:07.101
 that this spaghetti and meatballs has 

00:00:07.102 --> 00:00:08.040
12 hidden veggies in it

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.540
They didn't believe it either because 

00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:11.120
I didn't tell them and they didn't guess

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:12.480
In the Ninja Foodi Hot Cold Blender

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:13.480
I put onion garlic

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:14.320
carrot courgette

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:16.800
mushrooms and spinach alongside a little bit of oil

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.520
and I blended that on medium speed until the paste came together

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:22.480
in a large mixing bowl I popped a kilo of ground beef mince

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.000
3/4 cup of breadcrumbs

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.520
two tablespoons of dried oregano and dried mixed herbs

00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:27.640
1/4 cup of Parmesan

00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:29.240
my egg and my veggie paste

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:30.880
give it a mix and then roll it out into balls

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:32.320
I'm only using half of my mixture

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:34.480
and the other half is going in the freezer for later in the week

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:37.000
and I'm popping the meatballs in the fridge while I get started on my sauce

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:37.960
we've got onion garlic

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.920
capsicum mushrooms a can of chopped tomatoes and some fresh parsley 

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.560
I've also added dried oregano

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:43.920
mixed herbs and salt and pepper

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:44.833
measured with my heart

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:47.160
 and I put my Ninja Foodi on the sauce/dip setting

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:48.520
so it's gonna do all the work

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:49.800
cooking and blending it for me

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:51.960
while I get cracking on cooking the rest of the dinner

00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.280
and I've noticed that this blender has an ice cream setting

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.920
a cocktail setting and a frozen drink setting in case I wanna make a Margarita

00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:58.475
which I do 

00:00:58.476 --> 00:00:59.840
I do wanna make a Margarita

00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:02.800
once my sauce was done I just poured it over my browned meatballs

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:05.560
then I popped my meatballs and sauce on top of a bed of spaghetti

00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:07.960
topped with Parmesan and some Italian flat leaf parsley

00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:08.981
this meal went down a treat

00:01:08.982 --> 00:01:10.910
 and they didn't even know they were eating veggies
