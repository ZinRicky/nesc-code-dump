00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.280
People have asked me and I still take SAM.

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:07.221
E you take it everyday if you're like over 30,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.340
take it everyday because it helps your body process um,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.720
like the happy chemicals.

00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:17.281
Because when you get old, it's a chemical that your body needs.

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:18.641
Your body only naturally.

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:21.401
There's no way to get it in food or supplement

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:24.161
in any other way other than like a supplement.

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.021
It doesn't. It's not naturally occurring.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.240
Your body produces it,

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:30.101
but your body slows its production as you get older.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.520
And sometimes as you're getting older,

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:36.841
you may feel like you're like feeling depressed or sad.

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:37.841
Or maybe not depressed,

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:39.241
just like melancholy,

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:41.481
just down blue.

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:43.501
I don't know what was going on.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.000
If you could be low on SAM.

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.161
Even a lot of people don't know about it

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:47.281
cause a lot of people don't go to therapy,

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:49.121
but therapists are the one that tell you about it.

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:50.841
Or really, really good practitioner.

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:51.641
But whatever.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.040
I did what? And I see there's no fucking ad,

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:55.721
there's no sponsored.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.341
I don't know why women gotta hate on women making money.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.120
But I'm not making money on this video.

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:02.381
I'm just recommending for you to be happy.
