00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.440
It is Hurricane game day. Kids have got their setup.

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:05.841
They were blissfully unaware of everything going on.

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:07.961
We started getting the outer bands.

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:12.501
So lots of tornadoes and wind and just the gross stuff.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.360
And we have a few Hurricane rules in this house.

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:18.641
Logan, what are the Hurricane rules?

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:21.701
If I use a dish, it has to be cleaned immediately.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.620
No dirty dishes get left in the sink.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.640
What else? Uh,

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.081
only eat from fridge and freezer.

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:29.721
Until we lose power. Yes,

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:31.561
cause we wanna empty that out as much as possible.

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.321
Do not grab a snack from the pantry.

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:35.681
I know it's go to, but absolutely not.

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:38.321
And last one AC said that 62.

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:40.081
Don't open the doors. And if you're cold,

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:42.181
get a flipping blanket. Bingo.
