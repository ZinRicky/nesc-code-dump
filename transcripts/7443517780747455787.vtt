Having a hobby will give you depth to yourself

00:02.321 --> 00:04.041
and stimulate your brain. Golf.

00:04.042 --> 00:05.161
Am I good at it? No,

00:05.162 --> 00:07.241
but it's fun and you get to wear cute little outfit.

00:07.242 --> 00:09.601
Another option hiking. I used to live in Washington,

00:09.602 --> 00:11.481
so hike all the time. I'm in Texas now,

00:11.482 --> 00:12.561
so there's not that many hikes,

00:12.562 --> 00:14.001
but if you like being outdoors,

00:14.002 --> 00:15.601
try going on a hike, cooking a new recipe,

00:15.602 --> 00:19.161
or baking. I have always been a person who loves cooking,

00:19.162 --> 00:21.441
so if you want to get into cooking,

00:21.442 --> 00:22.521
this is a really good hobby.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.721
Reading. I love reading.

00:23.722 --> 00:26.801
Anything from  Colleen  Hoover is literally magic to my brain.

00:26.802 --> 00:28.921
Also painting, arts or crafts.

00:28.922 --> 00:31.301
I love anything that I can be creative in.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.120
This is, like,

00:32.121 --> 00:33.561
really where I got my happiest,

00:33.562 --> 00:36.121
when I can do my crafts. You might laugh and say this isn't a hobby,

00:36.122 --> 00:39.081
but I think getting coffee at a new cafe or place is a hobby.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.401
Along with trying a new restaurant.

00:40.402 --> 00:41.961
That is a hobby. Okay,

00:41.962 --> 00:44.281
understand that you're probably not depressed.

00:44.282 --> 00:46.762
You just need something to stimulate your brain.
