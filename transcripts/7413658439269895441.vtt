00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.727
Ahoy-Hoy! 

00:00:00.728 --> 00:00:01.760
my doormat's done

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:03.640
but first we recap cause a few days ago

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:05.640
I realised that my front door was kinda ugly

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.120
and my house was covered in spiders

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.825
which was definitely just one spider 

00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:09.840
working overtime right?

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:10.388
right!? 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.760
anyway we're gonna skip over the part where I killed a plant

00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:14.280
sacrifice to the gods I suppose

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.640
once I got up to this point it was time to paint my doormat

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:19.360
I had a few questions about it so I'm gonna tell you loosely what I did

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:21.040
I got a plain doormat from Mitre 10

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.280
and I bought some acrylic paints from Bunnings 

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.360
PS: those two must never know that the other one exists

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:27.560
and I free handed a font to the best of my abilities

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.040
which admittedly is not great

00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.600
but that's only cause I couldn't make a stencil

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:32.096
cause my printer will only print if I 

00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:33.160
pay subscription each month

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:34.760
which I flat out refuse to do

00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:36.872
anyway I rubbed some knobs until they shined 

00:00:36.873 --> 00:00:37.640
highly recommend

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.840
then I sanded the door frame and I sanded the door

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.080
and then I painted the door frame and I painted the door

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:44.480
so painting the door was a surprise to me as well

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:45.840
but when you look at something really close

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:48.000
then you can see the imperfections and once you see them

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:48.907
you can't unsee them 

00:00:48.908 --> 00:00:50.160
and when you can't unsee them

00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:51.560
they will keep you awake at night

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.000
and I had this leftover Dulux

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.762
enamel paint from our lounge renovation 

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:55.600
called Lake Brunner

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:57.120
and I always thought that my front door was blue

00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:58.964
which I liked but looking at it now I think

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:00.080
 it's more of a dusty grey

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:01.720
I cut everything in and then when it was dry

00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:03.675
went over it all with a mini roller because we 

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:04.840
can't have any brush strokes

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:06.400
but we can't stop there cause you know 

00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:07.680
that one spider I told you about

00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:10.200
turns out it's not just one and I have a problem

00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.600
actually I have many problems

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.800
but today we're gonna deal with the spider specific one

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.373
and the most commonly recommended product 

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:16.760
in my comment section was called

00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:17.600
Miss Muffets Revenge

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:20.080
and I bought it solely because I like the name

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:21.680
and now that the paint on the doormat is dry

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.440
I'm gonna seal it because I don't know

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:25.120
it feels like the right thing to do

00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:27.096
Anyway, massive side note but Alexander Graham Bell 

00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:28.160
invented the telephone right

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:30.400
and he wanted everyone to answer it by saying Ahoy-Hoy 

00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:33.080
but his rival Thomas Edison wanted everyone to say hello

00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:34.120
but now only Mister Burns says 

00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:36.185
Ahoy-Hoy, and I kinda wish we all said it 

00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:38.275
anyway that was the before during and after and 

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:39.320
I know now I need to pave it

00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:41.630
but first I gotta get back to what I supposed to be doing
