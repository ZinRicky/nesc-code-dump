00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.260
So TikTok is super overwhelming.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.360
As much as I do like to make content and like,

00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:11.541
to connect with people, it's.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.920
I am also a normal person.

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:16.181
And so when, like,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.560
magazines and, like,

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:19.541
news outlets reach out, I'm like,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.420
so I stick my head in the sand a little bit and I hide a little bit,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.240
which is what's currently happening,

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:29.841
and I'm trying to break out of it.

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:32.901
It's a game in my head. Um,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.780
so I bought some plants, I bought some flowers,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.860
and I'm posting this story,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.680
but otherwise, that's where I've been.

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:47.881
I'm just been sticking my head in the sand and hiding

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:50.121
cause the attention. I'm like, okay,

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:54.001
let me just wait till it all dies down and then I'll talk again,

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:57.981
you know, which is not the best if you're like,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.800
you know what I mean? Because this isn't like my job job.

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.861
This is something I do. Just.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.540
It's like a public service.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
My community service to the world

00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:10.481
is just educating women to not sacrifice your whole

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:11.481
entire life and happiness

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:14.381
to have someone's children and cook their favorite fucking meals.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.540
So anyway, that's where I've been.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.940
I did post, um,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.940
a podcast episode,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.000
something about the instantness of TikTok.

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:26.881
That it's like, Boom,

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:27.681
Boom.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.360
Gets overwhelming and then I, like,

00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:30.481
start to hide. But anyway,

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:33.381
I did post a podcast episode further explaining my,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.500
the red flags I see in the Ballerina Farms issue.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.620
And yeah,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.660
otherwise I'm having a Good weekend.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.220
Look at all my gray hair. I kind of like it.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.360
I'm into it. I got so many plants in my house.

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:46.221
I love it.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.951
Okay. I hope you guys are well. I love you so much.
