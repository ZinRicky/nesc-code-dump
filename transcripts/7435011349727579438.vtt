00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.480
So I'm about to start a movie Marathon with my kids and my family,

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:05.241
and all I wanna do is just, like,

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:08.401
hide in a hole. I did get out last night

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:11.961
and got to socialize with some other like minded individuals

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:16.361
here in Charleston. And the event was like an influencer thing,

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:19.141
but it was the. The vibe was somber.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.960
Like we were all just looking at each other,

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:23.081
checking in on each other,

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:26.961
you know? And those are the people

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:29.361
and those are the circles that I am seeking out right now,

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:33.481
because I can't not think or talk about what has happened.

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:39.181
I am still processing all of my anger and disappointment and sadness,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.360
um,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.640
about the election, and I don't know how long that's gonna take

00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.961
until we're business as usual.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:49.281
I mean, I know I can't sit in here in this, like,

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:55.201
weird, shocky headspace for much longer.

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:57.401
I mean, we've got kids,

00:00:57.402 --> 00:00:59.481
we've got life, the world keeps turning,

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:00.481
that sort of thing. Like,

00:01:00.482 --> 00:01:02.441
we're gonna keep going one day at a time.

00:01:02.442 --> 00:01:06.581
But I do know that I'm just emotionally

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.800
not great. Not great.

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.721
And I think the thing that I'm really sitting with

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:14.401
and trying to reconcile in my head

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:20.041
is knowing how many people wanted this

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:25.441
and having to reconcile my brain that I might have had this, like,

00:01:25.442 --> 00:01:30.761
inflated view of who we are as a nation and what we value.

00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:35.841
And I was wrong, at least for right now.

00:01:35.842 --> 00:01:38.481
I think a lot of buzzwords scared a lot of people.

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:41.961
I think a lot of issues that were either media made up

00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:44.841
or media exploited. Um,

00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:47.081
things that aren't real threats to our democracy,

00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:49.781
things that aren't real threats to your children

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.920
have been made into talking points

00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:54.041
that have rallied a great deal of people

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:55.001
who do, in fact,

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:56.841
just want their kids to be safe.

00:01:56.842 --> 00:01:59.821
I just don't think trans kids are as big of a threat to my kid

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.100
as your right to own an assault rifle.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.320
And never have I ever

00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:06.301
heard of a trans woman assaulting somebody in a bathroom.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.280
But I digress. Because I live in Charleston.

00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:11.521
I am kind of insulating right now.

00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:12.761
I'm turtle shelling

00:02:12.762 --> 00:02:16.501
because I'm not at a point where I can talk to somebody

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.200
and hear the devil's advocate

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:20.241
and hear the policies that they really liked

00:02:20.242 --> 00:02:24.881
or have a civil conversation about why they voted for Donald Trump.

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:30.421
I'm just not there yet. I am in the anger, disappointment,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.440
sadness, rage part of the grieving process.

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:38.021
And until I'm not, that kind of feral,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.940
could snap version of myself,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.180
I'm going to be, hmm, insulating.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.760
Although me and my husband

00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.361
plan to take the kids to a barbecue festival this weekend.

00:02:48.362 --> 00:02:49.321
Um, that was, like,

00:02:49.322 --> 00:02:50.041
before the election,

00:02:50.042 --> 00:02:54.741
and now I'm realizing it's gonna be like a star spangled Celebration

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.440
high five experience. So

00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:59.561
I don't know. It's weird.

00:02:59.562 --> 00:03:01.261
It's weird living in the south.
