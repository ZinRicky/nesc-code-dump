00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.240
Yes, thank god.

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:04.221
I don't think anything got ruined.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.280
Like,

00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:09.201
I do have baby memories that have water marks on them now and stuff,

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:11.541
but since I got to it and I was able to get everything dry,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.760
nothing was like ruined. It just.

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:16.941
It has new memories attached to it.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.680
Um, I think my boyfriend was able to like,

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:21.501
dry out all of his things.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.140
And the other thing that came of it was, um,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.220
I woke up the next morning like,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.960
so. Like,

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:33.161
my nerves were fucking shot.

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:34.981
I was like, like buzzing

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.120
even at like 6 o'clock in the morning.

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:38.621
And I was like, so convinced,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.740
like in previous relationships,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.560
I somehow would be in trouble for that.

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:44.081
Like, I would.

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:47.401
It would be my fault. I'm the one who needed to move to this place.

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:48.281
I'm the one who wanted it

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:50.741
or I'm the one who didn't think clearly.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.760
Somehow, some way,

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:53.201
it would have been 1,000% my fault

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:54.121
and I would have been in trouble

00:00:54.122 --> 00:00:54.921
and I would have been like,

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:57.141
in the dog house for weeks, months.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.200
It would have been something I never hear the end up,

00:00:59.201 --> 00:00:59.881
you know what I mean? Like,

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:00.961
oh my god. I was like,

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:02.781
so like, oh my god.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.280
And he woke up giving me hugs and kisses and,

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:09.561
you know, everything's okay.

00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:11.321
And then, um,

00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:13.121
even when the water thing was happening

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:14.641
and the carpet people were coming

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:17.761
and he was trying to put my kids beds Together.

00:01:17.762 --> 00:01:19.681
And I had to run to the grocery store,

00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:20.401
and then I was, like,

00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:23.801
stressed about dinner. He ordered $80 worth of pizza.

00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:24.361
I ordered, like,

00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:26.041
15 times more pizza than we needed,

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:26.881
so I had enough for, like,

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:28.541
dinner and lunch the next day.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.440
And then, like I said,

00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:31.001
he woke up in the morning giving me, like,

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:32.841
hugs and kisses and reassuring me that, like,

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:34.681
he's not mad at me. It's not my fucking fault.

00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:35.521
I didn't, like,

00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:37.281
burst the pipe myself or anything.

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:42.521
So it turned out to be a really,

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:44.201
like, a little bit of a good experience

00:01:44.202 --> 00:01:45.821
because nothing was ruined.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.080
The carpet got dry. Like,

00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:48.801
my property management company was.

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:50.481
Own it. The guy,

00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:53.801
the maintenance guy came yesterday to fix the water line and to make.

00:01:53.802 --> 00:01:54.881
And to hook up our cooler.

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:55.641
So, like,

00:01:55.642 --> 00:01:57.121
it's even better than it was.

00:01:57.122 --> 00:01:59.941
So, um. Yeah.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.280
Yeah, nothing got ruined. If.

00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:03.081
And it's, like,

00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:05.561
literally brought us closer together and made me just, like,

00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:07.321
even more confident of, like. Okay, yeah.

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:08.561
He is the man I thought he was.

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:09.881
I'm happy that he is my, like,

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:12.221
partner in this, not just like a.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.120
I don't know, a burden or,

00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:17.821
you know. So thanks for all the love and checking in.
