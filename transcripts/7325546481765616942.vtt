00:00.080 --> 00:02.480
This is Hannah from Ballerina Farms.

00:02.480 --> 00:03.400
She is a very,

00:03.400 --> 00:04.640
very big influencer.

00:04.640 --> 00:05.880
Millions of followers.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.440
Her and her family live on a farm.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.760
She has eight kids.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.680
She just does a lot of things.

00:10.680 --> 00:11.240
Like I said,

00:11.240 --> 00:12.000
very well known.

00:12.000 --> 00:12.600
Back in August,

00:12.600 --> 00:14.400
I competed at Mrs. America.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.800
I ended up meeting her once.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.040
She seemed totally cool.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.400
She ended up winning the Mrs.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.480
American title.

00:19.480 --> 00:20.160
If you win that,

00:20.160 --> 00:21.440
you go on to compete at Mrs.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.000
World, which is happening right now.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.920
And it just so happens that she had a baby,

00:24.920 --> 00:26.280
like, last week.

00:26.280 --> 00:26.960
Believe it or not,

00:26.960 --> 00:27.760
she is there,

00:27.760 --> 00:28.720
she's competing.

00:28.720 --> 00:29.920
She looks amazing.

00:29.920 --> 00:30.560
And this, of course,

00:30.560 --> 00:32.880
is making a lot of people very, very mad.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.360
I've never seen anything like it.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.080
And yet again,

00:35.080 --> 00:37.720
we are seeing this kind of double standard

00:37.720 --> 00:39.640
that we get from a lot of feminists.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.320
Feminism is super supportive of women

00:41.320 --> 00:42.920
chasing their dreams and doing things,

00:42.920 --> 00:45.400
but only the dreams that they deem appropriate.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.800
Had she had eight abortions

00:46.800 --> 00:48.400
in order to chase her dreams

00:48.400 --> 00:50.240
and in order to be a boss, babe,

00:50.240 --> 00:52.520
uh, these people would be cheering for her right now.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.520
But because she chose to take care of

00:54.520 --> 00:56.080
and love all eight of her babies,

00:56.080 --> 00:58.480
and the fact that she is wildly successful

00:58.480 --> 01:00.200
and prioritizes her family,

01:00.200 --> 01:01.800
it just drives these people insane.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.040
They have a very set ideal of what women

01:04.040 --> 01:05.960
are supposed to do and what women are supposed to be.

01:05.960 --> 01:06.880
They Won't admit it,

01:06.880 --> 01:07.560
but it's true.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.920
It isn't because they are concerned about

01:08.920 --> 01:10.300
her postpartum health

01:10.320 --> 01:11.160
or about her children

01:11.160 --> 01:12.720
or about the well being of her family.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.920
It's because she is continuing to completely destroy

01:15.920 --> 01:18.787
and dismantle the entire modern feminist message.
