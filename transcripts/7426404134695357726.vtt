00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
I don't know if I just understand the song wrong,

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:04.401
but when I hear Pink Pony Club,

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:05.681
I'm a mom. I'm 41.

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:09.201
Chapel Roan could actually be my daughter.

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:11.441
Like, if I got pregnant in high school really young,

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:11.801
and I was, like,

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:15.741
a teen mom, someone her age could maybe be my daughter.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.160
I would be a young mom. You know what I mean?

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.721
That would be crazy. But either way,

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:21.641
when I see her, I love her music.

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:23.081
And when I see her, like,

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:24.161
I'm so hopeful that, like,

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:25.761
maybe my daughter could be,

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:26.921
you know, reach her goals.

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:28.601
Like, she just gives me hope for my children.

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:30.801
Like, I no longer see people like that and think for myself.

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:33.121
I think for my kids. So I love her.

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:34.121
When I listen to her music,

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:35.121
I'm listening with, like,

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:36.601
a mother's ear. If it was, like,

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:38.041
my daughter singing those words,

00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:38.921
like, I would be,

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.241
you know, out of this world.

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:42.181
If my daughter. I'm proud of my kids.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.020
When I hear punk Pink Pony Club,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm so. There's times where I sing that song and I fucking cry.

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.381
The way she says, um.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.320
With the mom's response in the song,

00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:54.961
like, so happy for her.

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:56.201
She's singing at the Pink Pony Club.

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:57.201
That's what she wanted to do.

00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:58.841
She's so happy she made it to LA.

00:00:58.842 --> 00:00:59.921
And her mom is like, oh,

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:02.181
what have you done, girl?

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.040
And it makes me sad. And then when I sing The song.

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:08.601
I sing it like, because that's how I was singing the song originally.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:11.161
I would sing along to the song like if the mom was happy.

00:01:11.162 --> 00:01:13.401
And then I was like, but these words don't really sound as happy as

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:15.201
I feel like you would be if your daughter, like,

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:16.881
she made it to LA. She's singing,

00:01:16.882 --> 00:01:18.721
she's having fun, she's got friends.

00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:21.241
What's wrong here? And then I realize,

00:01:21.242 --> 00:01:23.761
oh, okay, okay,

00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:25.501
okay, okay, okay.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.460
Got it.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.200
And maybe I don't understand the song.

00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:31.301
I don't know.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.278
I do also just cry a lot, but whatever.
