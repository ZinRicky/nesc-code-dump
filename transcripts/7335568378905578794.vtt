00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.280
The difference between TikTok and Instagram

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.440
will never cease to astound me.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.360
I posted a boudoir photo shoot

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.520
that me and my husband did

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.920
over on Instagram for Valentine's Day.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.880
It was like,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.840
it was very covered,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.920
it was very tasteful,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.660
it was very fun and sexy.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.720
I wanna say, like,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.760
most people loved it.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.400
I think most people got the vibe.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.960
But I lost probably like

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.920
three or four hundred followers from that post alone.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.080
And I think there's such an interesting subtext of

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.840
when a woman is married

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.080
and a woman is a mother,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.480
there's this expectation of this purity to her.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.340
I don't think people love seeing,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.760
like, sexuality

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.560
being exuded by people who are wives and mothers.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.560
And I understand that posting those types of photos

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.200
is not gonna be something everybody wants to do.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.160
Not everybody is like

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.080
an exhibitionist in that kind of way.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.880
But I've talked on this before

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.600
on this app,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.680
that there is this, like,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.480
double standard

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.320
that women should be very sexy and sexual

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.360
up until they're married and have kids.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.220
But, like, how do you think we got all these kids
