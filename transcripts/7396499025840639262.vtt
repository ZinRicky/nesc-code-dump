Here is the worst part about the Olympics opening ceremony.

00:02.801 --> 00:04.961
No, it isn't that they were mocking Christianity,

00:04.962 --> 00:06.961
cause let's be honest, there is nothing new about that.

00:06.962 --> 00:08.481
It's getting boring at this point.

00:08.482 --> 00:10.881
Madonna was doing it back when she was really popular,

00:10.882 --> 00:12.481
and she's old enough to be my grandma,

00:12.482 --> 00:15.241
so were used to it. The worst part is this,

00:15.242 --> 00:19.001
that is a small child. And watching that whole performance,

00:19.002 --> 00:21.241
watching the outfits, watching the innuendos,

00:21.242 --> 00:22.321
watching the dance moves,

00:22.322 --> 00:25.361
anyone who's honest can admit that that is no place for a child.

00:25.362 --> 00:26.481
How did this child get there?

00:26.482 --> 00:29.321
Like, who are the adults in charge of making sure they are safe?

00:29.322 --> 00:31.201
If this child has been put in this situation,

00:31.202 --> 00:33.121
what other situations have they been put in?

00:33.280 --> 00:35.600
A lot of people saying that they wouldn't let their children watch it

00:35.601 --> 00:37.161
now, which I agree with.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.601
But can we address the fact that there is a child in the performance

00:40.602 --> 00:42.481
involved with these adults?

00:42.482 --> 00:42.881
As Christians,

00:42.882 --> 00:46.001
I think we get really defensive about our beliefs and about Christ,

00:46.002 --> 00:48.681
as we should. But the truth is that our faith is not that fragile.

00:48.682 --> 00:52.201
It has been mocked so many times and to the point where I'm just like

00:52.202 --> 00:53.041
over it. It's old,

00:53.042 --> 00:53.601
it's boring.

00:53.602 --> 00:56.241
It doesn't even make me angry anymore because I just don't care.

00:56.242 --> 00:59.321
It's boring. But if you really study the life of Jesus Christ himself,

00:59.322 --> 01:02.521
you'll see that he is very clear on What he thinks of people

01:02.522 --> 01:04.481
who put children in dangerous situations.

01:04.482 --> 01:07.321
I think the most disturbing thing about western culture right now

01:07.322 --> 01:08.961
is the way that we treat children.

01:08.962 --> 01:10.321
They are the most vulnerable,

01:10.322 --> 01:13.121
they are the most likely to be hurt and taken advantage of,

01:13.122 --> 01:15.761
and yet they are at the very bottom of the list of our priorities.

01:15.762 --> 01:17.761
If you are a Christian, if you are a religious person,

01:17.762 --> 01:19.441
if you are a decent person in general,

01:19.442 --> 01:21.244
that is what should really offend you.
