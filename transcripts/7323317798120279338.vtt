00:00.080 --> 00:01.720
If you don't know what to make for breakfast,

00:01.720 --> 00:03.600
make this mixed Berry croissant bake.

00:03.600 --> 00:05.500
It's absolutely delicious.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.680
I start off by slicing my croissants

00:07.680 --> 00:09.960
and layering them in a loaf pan,

00:09.960 --> 00:11.640
putting the middles down first,

00:11.640 --> 00:13.320
and then using the ends that I cut off

00:13.320 --> 00:14.560
to fill in all the gaps.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.520
Then I get started on my custard,

00:16.520 --> 00:19.080
which is basically just heavy cream, eggs,

00:19.080 --> 00:21.340
some orange zest and sugar,

00:21.360 --> 00:23.120
cinnamon and vanilla.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.960
I gave that a really good mix.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.300
Make sure that all the eggs are incorporated.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.000
Pour that over my croissants,

00:29.000 --> 00:30.700
and then pop that in the oven,

00:30.880 --> 00:31.920
wash my berries,

00:31.920 --> 00:34.440
and then when the croissant bake was 80% done,

00:34.440 --> 00:36.120
I pressed in my berries

00:36.120 --> 00:38.860
and baked until it came out golden brown.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.310
It was absolutely perfect.
