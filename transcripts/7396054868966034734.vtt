When my toddlers asked me for candy this morning,

00:02.641 --> 00:05.501
specifically the peach and apple ring gummies,

00:05.520 --> 00:07.860
I decided to just make them some.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.960
I started by blanching some peaches

00:09.961 --> 00:13.881
and then shocking them in an ice bath after to get the skin off.

00:13.882 --> 00:16.041
Then peeled all four of my peaches

00:16.042 --> 00:18.001
and made sure to get the skin off

00:18.002 --> 00:20.321
without taking any of the flesh with it.

00:20.322 --> 00:24.201
After that I gave them a rough chop before adding them to my blender

00:24.202 --> 00:27.121
alongside some orange. Once that was blended up,

00:27.122 --> 00:29.321
I passed that through a fine mesh strainer,

00:29.322 --> 00:31.541
added some honey and some gelatin.

00:31.760 --> 00:35.160
Let that bloom while I got started on cutting up my apples.

00:35.161 --> 00:38.441
I used a variation of Granny Smith and Honey Crisp.

00:38.442 --> 00:39.961
Once those were all chopped up,

00:39.962 --> 00:41.821
I put them through my juicer.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.200
Always reminds me of the time I used to work at a smoothie shop.

00:45.201 --> 00:48.721
I then strained my apple juice and added some lemon,

00:48.722 --> 00:51.961
a smidge of spirulina, but be sparing with it.

00:51.962 --> 00:54.961
Then I sprinkled on some gelatin for it to bloom.

00:54.962 --> 00:57.241
I returned both pots to the stove

00:57.242 --> 00:59.801
and heated them up until they became liquid

00:59.802 --> 01:02.481
and then poured them into my silicone molds.

01:02.482 --> 01:04.641
Placed these in the fridge for a few hours

01:04.642 --> 01:08.421
and then got started on my citric acid and sugar mixture.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.840
Once my gummies were ready,

01:09.841 --> 01:11.241
I coated them in this

01:11.242 --> 01:14.461
and these were gone before I could even plate them up.
