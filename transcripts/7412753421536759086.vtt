00:00.000 --> 00:01.360
I barely slept last night

00:01.361 --> 00:03.881
because I was so nervous about this hourglass

00:03.882 --> 00:05.961
Barney's meet and greet that I was doing,

00:05.962 --> 00:09.281
but you guys showed up, and this made my week.

00:09.282 --> 00:11.161
I started glam pretty early.

00:11.162 --> 00:13.601
I always have to use my hourglass concealer.

00:13.602 --> 00:17.161
The ones that have been around for a while know how much I love it.

00:17.162 --> 00:18.721
All the rest of my touch UPS,

00:18.722 --> 00:21.641
and then it was time to finish putting on my outfit.

00:21.642 --> 00:24.681
I was so excited to get this on that I ripped the zipper,

00:24.682 --> 00:28.701
so my tailor had to come over and literally sew me into my dress,

00:28.720 --> 00:31.240
put the skirt over, got it all snug,

00:31.241 --> 00:32.881
then I realized how late we were,

00:32.882 --> 00:36.161
so we grabbed the kids and started getting into the cars.

00:36.162 --> 00:39.881
Getting two toddlers and a baby into a car as a task,

00:39.882 --> 00:42.901
but we managed. And then headed over to the pop up.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.040
I had some time to walk around the store,

00:45.041 --> 00:47.081
look at all the hourglass makeup,

00:47.082 --> 00:50.641
look at all the amazing designers that were showing in the space.

00:50.642 --> 00:53.761
I also tried all the snacks and drinks that Fred's made

00:53.762 --> 00:55.881
before heading out to meet all of you.

00:55.882 --> 00:58.361
I can't believe how many of you guys came.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.041
I love chatting with you guys,

01:00.042 --> 01:03.881
answering questions, just hanging out and getting to know all of you.

01:03.882 --> 01:06.721
I can't believe how far some of you guys traveled,

01:06.722 --> 01:08.641
and I couldn't be more grateful.

01:08.642 --> 01:10.721
This was such a magical experience

01:10.722 --> 01:13.661
that I Couldn't stop crying on the way back to the hotel.
