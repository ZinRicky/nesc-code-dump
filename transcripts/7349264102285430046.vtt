00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.280
the most annoying group of people to deal with as a fat person on the internet 

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:06.081
it's not like the dude bros making fun of me and calling me fat in my comments 

00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:08.841
it's not Ed Twitter taking my videos and making me fatsp0

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.721
making fun of my body and everything about me

00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:12.561
so that they can starve themselves and not look like me

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:13.781
no it's neither of those

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.320
the group that is most annoying and irritated is the morally superior 

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:20.861
anti fat activist that takes fat people's content from TikTok

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.640
cut it up upload it to **Youtube**

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:24.001
making money off of our face

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.001
our content our

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.761
our movement because either they were fat and hate themselves

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:29.121
are currently fat and hate themselves

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.361
or just hate fat people in general

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:34.281
I have had so many of my videos taken and put on the internet

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:36.561
to be made fun of by a group of people that I don't know

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:37.401
that doesn't follow

00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:42.041
and every single one takes my arguments in the worst light possible

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.881
and makes me seem like I'm crazy

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:45.241
like I don't know what I'm talking about

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:46.361
like you know I'm

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:47.801
I'm making everything up and then like

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:50.001
search through your videos and try and like

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:53.361
point out inaccuracies to look for some kind of proof that like

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:55.521
fat people are all lying up being happy about themselves

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.441
they're all lying up being content in their body and like

00:00:57.442 --> 00:00:59.681
there's literally no room for nuance with that

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:01.081
and they all think that they're the good guy

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:01.841
that's the crazy

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:03.081
they make these videos

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:04.761
take people's content out of context

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:08.281
post it to a hostile audience and still think that they're the good guy

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:09.641
that's the thing that's the most frustrating

00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:11.521
cause like they think that they're in the right

00:01:11.522 --> 00:01:12.681
like you are a villain

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:13.801
you are a bad person

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:14.879
leave me the heck alone
