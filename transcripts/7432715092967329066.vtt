00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.080
Y'all are always asking me about my outfits,

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:05.321
so today I'm going to be recreating four of my viral outfits

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:07.661
and telling you where I got each of the pieces from.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.080
This is my most viral outfit of all time.

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:14.401
Every single time I post this outfit,

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:16.461
it goes majorly viral for some reason.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.140
Just so funny. It's just a sweater from Ross

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.240
and a tiered skirt that I got from a modest clothing boutique.

00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:25.061
The bow and the apron are just from Amazon.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.480
This is one of my more recent viral outfits,

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:31.881
and this cracked me up because someone actually commented

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:35.621
and asked if I got the outfit from Spirit Halloween.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.100
Actually, both of these pieces I found at TJ Maxx.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.080
And the head scarf is just a cute

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:43.301
floral Bandana that I got from the scarf bar.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.760
This blouse has served me so well with so many different outfits.

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:52.561
It is just perfect to wear with everything.

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:55.821
So I put it under this dress that I got at a local boutique.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.620
This outfit also got a lot of hate.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.760
The blouse is universal thread.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.421
I thrifted it, but I think it's a target brand.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.860
And then the jumper I got thrifted.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.280
I also wore a head scarf with this.

00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:12.241
And this scarf I thrifted as well.

00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:14.981
Most of my clothes are thrifted.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.880
Some of them are handmade.

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:20.601
And I just hope that this inspires you to go to the thrift store

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:23.661
or look at some Instagram thrift resellers.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.000
And start putting pieces together

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.321
because some of my favorite blouses are just from like

00:01:27.322 --> 00:01:29.501
TJ Maxx or Walmart or target.
