00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.600
Okay, I'm about to go get my hair done,

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:02.761
but I wanted to show you my outfit

00:00:02.762 --> 00:00:05.281
because I wanted to really dopamine dress today.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.200
I'm wearing all of these things that just make me so incredibly happy.

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:11.441
Starting off with this Lily Am swing coat,

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:13.761
this vintage coat. So pretty.

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:15.581
It's like a dress on top of a dress.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.800
And then bright colors. We're feeling,

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:19.261
like, the green and turquoise.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.740
I added some of these vintage brooches.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.840
And then I have the same colors kind of

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:25.201
in my earrings and my accessories

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:26.461
and these little booties.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.160
Oh, and the.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:32.101
And the purse. I'll take the strap off.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.480
When you dress in a way that makes you happy,

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:43.161
it really changes your mood or it enhances your mood.

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:44.881
I just. I love color,

00:00:44.882 --> 00:00:46.421
and I think this is so cute.
