00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.860
we've had our UPS and downs Chloe

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.800
thank you thank you

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:13.120
thank you Chloe goes on to say that it's a red flag

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:15.480
now this isn't her normal type of content

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.960
but I really applaud it um

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:19.200
because I think it's really

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:23.020
really important for people to be thinking like this

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.280
and not that it always is a red flag

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:30.320
and not that it always means something suspicious is happening

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:33.540
or something dubious is going on in the relationship

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.400
but just that people need to have a lens um

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:43.260
of understanding that abusive relationships are living and breathing amongst us

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.140
the monster myth is real it is a myth

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.000
it is there um

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:53.940
to ensure that men can keep getting away with abuse

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.640
and look and live and breathe like normal

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:02.880
decent human beings um

00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:05.160
all while perpetrating in plain sight

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:07.600
we all get told that marriage is really hard work

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.100
and that we have to make compromises and sacrifices

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.960
and women especially get told this is

00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:15.680
falls into the category of gendered advice

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:19.800
and at this point I think we always need to be asking is propaganda

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:23.180
because we have a lot of gender propaganda

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.380
lies myths

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.840
mistruths that have been told to us as we grow up

00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:33.760
from the stage of being little girls um

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:40.500
that really set us up and condition us for a life of domestic servitude to men

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.460
intergenerational propaganda is absolutely essential to ensuring that any

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.180
power source can continue to perpetrate abuse

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.360
um any oppressor continue

00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:00.080
can continue to oppress now

00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:02.920
we live in a patriarchy it's intergenerational

00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:05.860
we've lived in one for quite a long time now

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.640
um in order for a patriarchy to survive

00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:13.240
just like in order for an oligarchy to survive

00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:15.900
in order for a dictatorship to survive

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.280
um in order for a monarchy to survive

00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:21.160
we need propaganda and brainwashing

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:25.380
so I'm here to debunk a lot of the brainwashing

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.100
just make people rethink a few things

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.080
not casting judgement on people

00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:33.820
definitely not definitely not

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.540
um tryna make people's lives harder

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:46.260
just asking people to stay curious and to check in on themselves and each other

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.022
um stay safe out there girls love you
