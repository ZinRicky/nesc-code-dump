00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
I'm a tried wife. I got married at 18.

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:03.201
My husband is the main breadwinner,

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.401
and I'm pregnant with our first child.

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:06.341
What would I do if my husband died?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.120
This question

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:10.361
I've been asked a lot by naysayers and just curious individuals.

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:13.521
So welcome to part two of my series on emergency protocols.

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:16.001
I think it's really important to have different supports.

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.361
I guess I would call it in place that would help you manage life

00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:23.061
if a catastrophe like my husband dying were to happen.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.180
So if something were to happen to my husband,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.400
I would go back and live under my father's roof.

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:28.321
So it's really important

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:30.401
to maintain healthy relationships with my parents,

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:31.881
not just for this, but obviously

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:33.001
for all the other benefits

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.761
of having a healthy relationship with your parents.

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:35.601
When we got married,

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.721
they already told Andrew that if something happened to him,

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:39.541
they would take me back under their roof,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.580
provide for me financially,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.680
and help me with that transition.

00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:45.341
I think it's also really important to have a good church family

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.800
to help with childcare, meals,

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.221
financially, if needed.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.100
Um, that is what the church is for.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.400
So we have a really amazing church family that I know would do that.

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:56.721
I've seen them do that in other families lives.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.161
So that is another really important support.

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:01.481
Have, I think also good relationships with in laws and siblings.

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.421
In laws. We know our neighbors,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.880
people that we could call over who Lived really close

00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:07.601
in case I needed help with, like,

00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:09.881
heavy lifting stuff or if my car didn't start.

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:12.521
Lastly, having solid marketable skills.

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:14.001
And I cannot stress this enough.

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:15.761
I have worked really hard a lot of my life

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:17.241
to develop marketable skills.

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:19.841
I also know many people in our local community.

00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:21.361
If entrepreneurship wasn't working,

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:23.561
I am well networked in our local community,

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:26.601
and I could get a job with a local business.

00:01:26.602 --> 00:01:29.472
Like and follow for the next part of my emergency protocol series.
