00:19.720 --> 00:20.700
Good morning.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.280
So we are here at the dairy.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.240
We're giving a tour to a Brazilian group

00:26.240 --> 00:27.780
that also has a dairy,

00:29.520 --> 00:33.580
and they're selling into 80 milk which will be selling.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.580
What are you doing?

00:48.800 --> 00:50.720
You know, when we were in Brazil

00:50.720 --> 00:55.340
is really when Dan and I both started

00:56.160 --> 00:58.680
becoming more and more passionate about agriculture.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.980
Because it wasn't a lot of,

01:01.320 --> 01:03.120
um, like milk.

01:03.120 --> 01:03.640
For instance,

01:03.640 --> 01:05.380
when I'd go to the grocery store,

01:05.480 --> 01:07.680
all they would have was, um,

01:07.680 --> 01:09.060
shelf stable milk,

01:09.360 --> 01:11.640
and it gave me a stomachache every time I drink it.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.340
And so in Brazil, I,

01:13.960 --> 01:16.040
who's always trying to find these little farms

01:16.040 --> 01:17.300
which were prevalent,

01:17.320 --> 01:18.160
are prevalent there.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.500
There's still a lot of rural areas,

01:21.200 --> 01:22.600
and so I was finding these little farms

01:22.600 --> 01:24.560
to get raw milk from and fresh milk.

01:24.560 --> 01:27.200
And so we started hanging out with these farmers

01:27.200 --> 01:28.960
and people that were living off the land

01:28.960 --> 01:30.900
or supporting their communities.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.120
That's really when we fell in love with agriculture

01:34.120 --> 01:34.960
and we were like, okay,

01:34.960 --> 01:37.420
when we go back to the United States,

01:37.520 --> 01:38.720
this is what we wanna do.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.620
You know, we wanna,

01:40.480 --> 01:42.100
um, get into farming,

01:42.200 --> 01:43.760
Wanna support our family.

01:43.760 --> 01:45.080
We don't just wanna do like

01:45.080 --> 01:45.680
a hobby farm,

01:45.680 --> 01:46.800
we want it to be like

01:46.800 --> 01:47.740
our livelihood.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.880
And so, um. Yeah,

01:50.880 --> 01:53.640
that's really where it all blossomed

01:53.640 --> 01:55.760
was when we were living in Brazil.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.980
We were in San Paulo,

01:58.560 --> 02:01.000
and, um. Yeah.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.880
So it's so cool seeing this family here.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.220
They've been Farming for a lot of years,

02:06.280 --> 02:09.120
but now are marketing an a to a

02:09.120 --> 02:11.680
to raw milk and fresh milk

02:11.680 --> 02:14.160
to super mercados

02:14.160 --> 02:15.620
at grocery stores

02:16.040 --> 02:17.600
and also direct consumer.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.757
So it's very, very cool.
