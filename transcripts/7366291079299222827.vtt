00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.360
You literally set up your camera and then went and sat down and blah,

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:07.341
blah, blah,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.140
just so you can film it.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.800
Yeah. Did you see?

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.061
The shit went viral.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.280
What's the problem?

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:14.281
What's the question here?

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.641
Where's the confusion here?

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:17.421
I mean, yeah,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.040
when you watch Transformers,

00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:21.621
did you think there was really robots in the streets

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.360
making explosions and shit?

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.641
Or do you think they set up cameras

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:28.961
and had people come and did all this shit and filmed it?

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:29.481
Oh, my god.

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:32.101
It's like the most ignorant shit ever.
