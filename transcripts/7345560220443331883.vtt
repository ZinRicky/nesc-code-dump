My husband's been craving barbecue chicken pizza

00:02.320 --> 00:04.200
and he wanted to order for dinner tonight,

00:04.200 --> 00:06.000
so I decided to get a head start

00:06.000 --> 00:07.280
and just make it myself.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.640
I never thought I'd be making barbecue chicken pizza

00:09.640 --> 00:10.520
as a European,

00:10.520 --> 00:11.400
but here we are.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.920
I started by making my dough

00:12.920 --> 00:15.140
and letting that rise for about two hours,

00:15.320 --> 00:16.240
and in the meantime,

00:16.240 --> 00:19.600
I made my barbecue sauce by combining some ketchup,

00:19.600 --> 00:20.760
red wine vinegar,

00:20.760 --> 00:22.520
garlic, some other condiments,

00:22.520 --> 00:23.840
and letting that simmer.

00:23.840 --> 00:24.800
Once it's thickened,

00:24.800 --> 00:27.740
I let it cool and started on making my cheese.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.760
Made a simple mozzarella cheese by combining some milk

00:30.760 --> 00:32.920
with some renet and some citric acid,

00:32.920 --> 00:34.000
letting that sit,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.200
slicing up my curds in a grid pattern,

00:36.200 --> 00:38.080
and then returning that to the stove,

00:38.080 --> 00:39.360
and I let it drain

00:39.360 --> 00:42.900
and stretched it out to form my little cheese balls.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.720
Once my dough has doubled in size,

00:44.720 --> 00:46.800
I flour down my work surface

00:46.800 --> 00:49.160
and make sure to coat it in all that flour

00:49.160 --> 00:51.020
because it is really sticky.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.840
Divided into four pieces,

00:52.840 --> 00:54.200
form those into little balls

00:54.200 --> 00:56.400
and let those rest for another 30 minutes.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.880
Cover them with a kitchen towel

00:57.880 --> 00:59.320
to prevent them from drying out,

00:59.320 --> 01:01.940
and then move on to making my shredded chicken.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.640
Can season it however you like.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.480
Just make sure your pan is really hot

01:05.480 --> 01:07.000
to get a good sear on it,

01:07.000 --> 01:08.160
and let that fry

01:08.160 --> 01:10.900
and slice up my red onion in the meantime.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.120
Once my chicken was done and Rested,

01:13.120 --> 01:16.400
I shredded it up and set that aside.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.920
I like prepping all my ingredients,

01:17.920 --> 01:19.560
so I sliced up my mozzarella

01:19.560 --> 01:22.960
and also decided to add some banana peppers. This point,

01:22.960 --> 01:25.400
I formed my dough into little circles,

01:25.400 --> 01:27.440
spread some of that barbecue sauce on there.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.400
Then I went in with some chicken peppers, some onion,

01:30.400 --> 01:31.560
my mozzarella,

01:31.560 --> 01:34.080
and slid that onto my pizza stone.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.240
Let that bake for about five to six minutes,

01:36.240 --> 01:37.480
topped it with cilantro,

01:37.480 --> 01:39.040
some more barbecue sauce,

01:39.040 --> 01:41.007
and dinner was done.
