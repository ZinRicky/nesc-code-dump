00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.640
Processed food industry was created by the cigarette industry.

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.281
People don't know this, but in 1990,

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:06.961
the three largest processed food companies were cigarette companies.

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.241
Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds,

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:09.681
and others still to this day.

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:10.881
Philip Morris owns craft.

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:12.641
Most of the companies were spun out in the 1990s,

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:15.541
but cigarette companies literally took their scientists.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.560
Cigarettes companies were declining

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:20.361
and put them over to food companies to make the food more addictive.

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:22.761
And all those thousands of ingredients that we have in our food

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:24.321
are made to addict our children.

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:27.121
It's hijacking our biology and our understanding of, like,

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:30.721
what we're reading. You don't binge on natural food because the.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:34.041
Our bodies are made over thousands of years to be with this food.

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:36.001
Yeah, but processed food is not natural.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.436
It's hijacking our biology.
