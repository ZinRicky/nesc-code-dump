00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.880
Okay, I said I was gonna make videos

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:04.081
talking about how to not be anti Semitic

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:06.401
when you are trying to support Palestinian liberation.

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:07.761
So this is video one.

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.121
I would like to preface this that I am not an expert in this.

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:11.781
I am just a Jewish person.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.500
That's it. Those are my credentials.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.360
But something I've noticed that people are doing

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.201
are going to random Jewish creators pages

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:20.241
on completely unrelated videos.

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:21.521
Or even worse,

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:24.681
if they're specifically talking about a Jewish religious practice,

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:26.361
like what they're making for Shabbat dinner

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:28.641
and commenting on those videos like, well,

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:29.881
what do you feel about Israel?

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:31.001
How do you feel about Palestine?

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:35.281
That feels and comes off pretty anti Semitic and attacky really,

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:37.581
cause you're only doing it because they're Jewish.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.680
Even someone like me

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:41.281
who has posted pro Palestinian content

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:44.001
and nuanced content about everything going on,

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.001
I still get like

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.921
the nervousness to share anything about my Jewishness right now

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:50.961
because it's going to be met with anti Zionist activists.

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:53.721
That doesn't come off as well meaning activism.

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:56.281
It comes off as disguised anti Semitism,

00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:57.781
which is not the intention.
