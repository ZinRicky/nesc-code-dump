00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
If you’re in a relationship and you don't know what to say to your partner

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.481
when they're feeling down or sad

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:06.001
they seem inconsolable

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.879
saying these simple phrases will 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.441
always have a big impact on your relationship

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:11.201
not only that

00:00:11.202 --> 00:00:13.441
it'll make them fall in love with you over and over again

00:00:13.442 --> 00:00:14.481
People who say these phrases

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:16.774
in relationships are generally happier and 

00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:18.481
their love is generally stronger

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:20.766
It’s so important to make your partner feel 

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:22.481
understood and emotionally secure

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:25.481
so say these phrases, whenever you don't know what to say

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:28.334
No. one “what do you need for me, I'm here”

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:30.441
if you say that to your partner

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:31.571
they will be shocked 

00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:33.241
A, because no one ever says that

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.521
and B, makes them feel secure(emotionally validated)

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:38.491
Also saying, “your thoughts matter to me, tell me more”

00:00:38.492 --> 00:00:41.681
communication is obviously key to any healthy relationship

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:42.721
Oops I set it to one minute, 

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:43.730
so I'll do a part two.
