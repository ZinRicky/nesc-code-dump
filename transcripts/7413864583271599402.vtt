00:00.160 --> 00:02.220
Hey guys, we went to Swig.

00:02.280 --> 00:06.020
Swig is the soda shop in Utah that does crazy soda flavors

00:06.360 --> 00:07.840
and they have a drive through.

00:07.841 --> 00:11.961
So we got a bunch to try. The first one we got is Riptide.

00:11.962 --> 00:14.401
Both lucky and I don't drink soda with caffeine,

00:14.402 --> 00:16.501
so we got all the caffeine free options.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.960
This is Riptide. It's Sprite,

00:18.961 --> 00:21.561
cranberry, raspberry puree and lime.

00:21.562 --> 00:24.141
I got triple lime because I'm a lime addict.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.020
Yeah, this is good.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.500
What do you rate it out of 10?

00:34.600 --> 00:36.900
A 6. A 6.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.800
I don't taste the triple lime,

00:38.801 --> 00:39.741
I'll be honest.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.480
This is island time. Lucky got this in a 32 ounce.

00:43.481 --> 00:45.581
I don't know why, but, um. Fresca.

00:45.720 --> 00:49.320
What's fresca? Passion fruit,

00:49.321 --> 00:51.201
fresh orange, mango puree,

00:51.202 --> 00:52.381
coconut cream.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.780
Why do I feel like this is not gonna be fizzy?

00:56.800 --> 00:58.260
That is insane.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.500
That is so good. I like it.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.240
Very good. Very good,

01:07.241 --> 01:08.801
very good. Eight out of 10.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.801
I give it a nine. It's stunning.

01:10.802 --> 01:12.881
I don't. I didn't think I'd like it.

01:12.882 --> 01:15.801
We got kid sizes cause we knew we weren't gonna drink it all.

01:15.802 --> 01:18.061
So this is cinnamon, cider,

01:18.120 --> 01:19.580
ginger ale, lemonade,

01:20.160 --> 01:24.180
cinnamon apple and a cinnamon stick.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.980
I don't know about. I don't know about this one either.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.780
No,

01:33.880 --> 01:37.500
it's enough for me. No. Three out of 10.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.400
We have pink Bahama. Yes,

01:41.401 --> 01:42.361
we do. Yes we do.

01:42.362 --> 01:44.881
What's in it? Fresca. Peach,

01:44.882 --> 01:46.441
strawberry, raspberry,

01:46.442 --> 01:47.681
fresh lime. Wait,

01:47.682 --> 01:50.541
that actually sounds insane. Haha.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.020
I get you. So Right, Mama?

01:55.320 --> 01:56.880
Oh, I'm underwhelmed.

01:56.881 --> 02:03.641
Love it. 7 out of 10 5 called popping pineapple.

02:03.642 --> 02:06.041
It has Sprite, pineapple, watermelon,

02:06.042 --> 02:08.041
strawberry, popping pearls. Oh,

02:08.042 --> 02:10.461
it should have given us a bigger straw for this.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.660
I don't care about it at all.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.620
Two out of 10?

02:19.920 --> 02:21.200
Try 10. Right?

02:21.201 --> 02:24.001
Maybe three. The last one is the Tropic.

02:24.002 --> 02:25.641
What's in it? Lemonade,

02:25.642 --> 02:26.921
mango, passion fruit,

02:26.922 --> 02:27.961
vanilla cream.

02:27.962 --> 02:29.581
Wait, I'm actually intrigued.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.200
That's good, but I.

02:33.201 --> 02:34.601
Let you tell me what's off with it.

02:34.602 --> 02:36.481
It's not fizzy. It's not fizzy.

02:36.482 --> 02:36.961
And, like,

02:36.962 --> 02:39.501
isn't the vanilla just so, like, thick?

02:39.640 --> 02:41.600
One out of 10. One out of 10.

02:41.601 --> 02:44.101
Negative zero. Negative 10.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.560
That's a little harsh. I would give it one out of 10.

02:46.561 --> 02:50.961
My overall favorite is one I ordered Island Time.

02:50.962 --> 02:55.337
Island Time. Mine is a tie between Island Time and Riptide.
