00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
The red states on this map still have 7 25 dollars as minimum wage.

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:05.801
Do you wanna know how much 7 25 is every year?

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.721
It's 15 thousand dollars. Which means

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:09.521
the fast food workers in all of the red states

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:12.281
are at a 50 thousand dollar annual disadvantage

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:14.121
because the average cost to live in America

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:15.761
is about 77 thousand dollars.

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:16.681
Before you tell me oh,

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:19.401
all the fast food workers are just teenagers that want extra money,

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:23.161
that's false because about 30% of fast food workers are teenagers,

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:26.521
meaning about 70% of the fast food workers are not teenagers.

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:30.481
As a matter of fact, 40% of fast food workers are either 25 or older.

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:33.761
2024 alone, chick fil A brought in a 47 million dollar profit

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:36.521
and McDonald's brought in 1.6 million dollars of profit.

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:37.361
Quick service restaurants,

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:38.521
otherwise known as fast food,

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:43.081
brought in over 40 $490 billion of profit just in one year.

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:45.921
7 25 is still acceptable in some states as minimum wage.

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:46.721
But then if you're homeless,

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:48.681
you get criminalized because that's not okay

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.601
according to Scottish. This is why unionizing and support

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:54.961
and supporting measures that support union workers

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:56.761
are so freaking important.

00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:58.401
Is an absolute abomination

00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:02.841
that 7 25 minimum wage is still build a thing in 2024.

00:01:02.842 --> 00:01:04.281
As a country, we're way better than this

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:05.121
and we need to move on.

00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:07.561
And we need to choose accordingly on our ballots

00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:10.721
so we can continue to help and support union workers

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:12.336
and people who want To unionize
