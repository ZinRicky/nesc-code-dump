00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.120
so I just found out that Liam Payne died um

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:05.080
and it's a really complicated feeling right now

00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:07.340
growing up I was a really big fan of one direction

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.560
really important part of my childhood

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:10.640
that being said

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:15.480
I have been caught up with all of the things that have been coming out about him

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.200
in the last few weeks um

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:18.900
so I just wanted to say

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.940
before this becomes crazy

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.120
have your feelings have your feelings about Liam

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:26.580
you can have your feelings about

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.640
you know being a fan of his

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:30.400
you know him being one direction

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:33.480
I understand he was a really big part of a lot of people's childhoods

00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:34.790
that being said

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:36.800
 leave Maya Henry alone

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:40.200
leave the woman that have spoken about him alone

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:40.920
other right now

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:43.360
this is what Maya Henry's comment section looks like

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:47.840
I genuinely could not imagine what that woman is going through right now

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:49.680
um absolutely unacceptable

00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:54.440
like it's really unfortunate to be watching this happen in real time because

00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:56.200
like regardless of your feelings about him

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:57.720
like this is a tactic of abuse

00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:00.200
like things were coming out about him

00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:02.620
I'm sure more things are gonna come out about him

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.500
and to escape responsibility like

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.640
and this also guarantees that his victims will have to be

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:14.980
even in his death

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.440
perpetually victimized by him and his actions and his stans and his fans

00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:21.680
so you can have your feelings

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:25.200
but don't perpetuate the same abuse to his victims that he did

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:30.600
separate your feelings as a fan from their feelings as victims of abuse

00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:31.966
I don't know just leave those women alone
