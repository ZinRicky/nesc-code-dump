00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.320
Pennsylvania has 19, like tarts and selections.

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:04.541
That's why me and my best friend went to go canvas.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.560
We hopped on a bus from New York City to acute headquarters

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.421
in an important swing district.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.200
At the headquarters,

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:14.141
you get geared up with literature and talking points,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.460
and paired with a local driver to head to your location.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.520
On our way to our first house,

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:22.081
and both of us have never formally canvassed before.

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:25.001
First timer, so let's see how this goes.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.001
And off we go.

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.121
There's a super easy app to download to help you navigate

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:29.961
as you walk through each neighborhood that you're canvassing.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:32.861
Voters aren't home. We provide them literature to read on their own.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.920
Sure, there's a couple Trump signs,

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:37.995
but there is way more Harris Waltz signs.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.960
There are so many awesome volunteers out here every weekend,

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:43.281
building community for a better future.

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:43.961
It locked on, like,

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:45.961
I think 55 different doors today.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:47.481
I think I'll definitely do it again.

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:49.461
It was an amazing first experience.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.640
Was like, the topics that you think we heard the most.

00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:53.821
The economy is what we heard the most.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.760
Spoke to a lot of undecided voters,

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:57.401
which is kind of shocking to think about.

00:00:57.402 --> 00:00:57.961
But, hey,

00:00:57.962 --> 00:01:01.581
people. People were much more open to listening than I really expected.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.840
Like, why we were out there,

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:04.881
and we would both explain our own stories.

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:07.681
I share. Just want people to mind their own business.

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:10.121
About my body. 10 out of 10 would Recommend.

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:12.321
But there's still weekends that people can go out and do this.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.841
Three more weekend days left.

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:14.841
Oh, my god. Yes!

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.141
Trick or treating for votes.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.940
Trick or treating for votes.
