00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.900
he hates you they hate us

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.780
men do not like us

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.960
most men would see this and immediately dismiss it as hyperbole

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:16.761
but what they should do instead is look at why it is true for women

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:19.001
that they feel like men hate us

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:24.361
this statement is emotionally true for many women

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:31.181
we feel like men hate us and what that actually means is a whole bunch of things

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.300
it means that many men do actually hate us

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.440
it means that we feel that the patriarchy has set women up to fail

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.141
we feel that the patriarchy is against us

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.920
and we know that a lot of the time men don't love us

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:51.041
they love what we do for them

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:55.601
a lot of men have conditional attraction toward women

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:58.961
because they don't respect us as humans

00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:01.161
they don't respect our whole personhood

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:05.021
they only respect us as an extension of them

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.760
IE what we or our relationship to them says about them

00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:15.301
men will simp after the respected admiration of other men

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.380
um not the respect and admiration of women

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.580
but being with women and having women

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.920
um is something that men can do to gain respect and admiration from other men

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.921
and women see this and women feel this and women know this

00:01:31.922 --> 00:01:34.761
conditional affection is the idea that basically

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:38.661
women are there to be caregivers wives

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.600
mothers um lovers

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:45.461
we need to serve a particular role

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.560
um for men

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:51.081
what we do for men and if we neglect

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:55.601
to do that or decide we don't wanna do that anymore or challenge that

00:01:55.602 --> 00:01:58.361
then we are no longer useful to men

00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:01.521
we are no longer serving our role as women to men

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:04.421
so therefore they begin to hate us

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.660
I'm sure many people would have had this experience in a relationship

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.840
where it's all going really well with a man

00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:14.401
and he just adores you um

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:17.221
because he sees you as a B and C

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.120
and as the relationship progresses

00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:23.201
and you challenge some of those expectations or ideas that he's put on you

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:27.261
about who you are and what your role is in relation to him

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.080
he begins to literally hate you

00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:34.781
like you actually feel like he does not like you at all

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.340
because you are no longer doing your

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.440
you know pre conditioned role

00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:49.101
your prescribed role for him because he never loved you as a whole person

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.960
um as a woman

00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:52.161
your person who doesn't matter

00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:53.841
your strip back um

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:59.221
to the role of woman there's a concept called homo sociality

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.200
I think I said that right and I touched on it before

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:06.921
and it's the idea that men are actually just looking to secure um

00:03:06.922 --> 00:03:10.641
the respect of other men rather than from women

00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:14.261
so for men the pursuit of status

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.100
amongst male relationships is more important than securing the affection

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.120
or genuine respect from women

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:27.301
so women's needs are then sidelined

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.520
um in favour of any kind of um

00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:34.321
other male respect that they can gain

00:03:34.322 --> 00:03:39.121
men are looking to gain and reinforce their position within patriarchy

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:44.141
they're not looking to gain the Equality or equity

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.100
actual connection and um

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.780
respect from women or in relationships with women

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.060
if that makes sense

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.200
so if you start being a difficult woman or a woman that doesn't give a man um

00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:01.861
that type of status that he craves

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.040
um then you become non useful um

00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:10.101
to men and he will start to um resent

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.340
so when we say men hate us

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.142
that's kinda what we mean
