00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.480
people don't actually understand that your poor sleeping habits

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:05.441
affect your relationship with your partner

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:09.181
many issues in relationships are directly related to sleep

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.640
couples aren't getting good quality sleep

00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:14.781
which directly leads to arguments and other issues

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.320
so many issues in relationships are directly related to sleep

00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:23.061
issues, we all should understand that we need sleep to properly function.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.040
in some studies,

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:27.801
people have said that sleep deprivation is probably one of the worst

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.381
forms of punishment

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.260
so we all should agree that sleep is important right?

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.680
not only is it important,

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:37.061
but it's also important to get good quality sleep

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.840
Do you get good sleep? Well

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:41.681
the first step is understanding your basic sleep cycles

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:43.201
and the most important stages

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:44.441
which are three and four

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:46.121
okay all stages are important

00:00:46.122 --> 00:00:49.181
but stage 3 is when you get deep sleep

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.020
is basically when your body repairs itself, and builds tissue, bone,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.680
muscle, all very vital okay

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.561
age 4 is dream sleep

00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:00.301
this is when your brain dreams,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.920
processes information,

00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:03.421
and stores memories.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.480
If you're not getting good quality sleep

00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:07.681
your body isn't able to repair itself,

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:09.941
you're not able to process information,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.460
store your memories,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.600
If youâ€™re not getting good sleep

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.441
this is gonna affect your mood,

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:15.201
your physical,

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:16.201
mental health,

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:18.221
and then that's gonna affect your relationship.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.380
Sleep is such a critical pillar of health

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.380
that's probably why you see so many couples not sharing the same bed

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.960
your schedule or routine doesn't align with theirs

00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:30.521
so it's important to find what works for you

00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:31.361
at the end of the day

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.201
if you're not getting good quality sleep

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:36.261
that's gonna directly affect your relationship, and 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.660
love for each other

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.040
so make sure you're getting good!

00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:39.981
Quality sleep
