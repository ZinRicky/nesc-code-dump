00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.920
Another reason I'm really mad that my car got busted like this

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.041
is because I just got this wireless car charger.

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:11.801
You clip it to your car, it has a cord that connects to your outlet,

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:14.821
and then it's mag safe. So you just attach your phone to it,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.600
and it'll charge your phone hands free.

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:18.321
Super easy, you know,

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:19.801
like clicking in and out or anything.

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:22.941
So I can't wait to try it.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.960
I don't even know when my car is gonna be done,

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:27.281
cause they found even more damage.

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:29.961
So the original estimate that the insurance companies gave them,

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:30.601
they're like, ooh,

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:32.241
you hit the nail on the head.

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:33.681
Well, we gotta add a little bit more,

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:35.181
so there's even more damage.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.920
So Lord knows when I will ever get my car back.

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:42.138
But if you want one of these, let's link right here.
