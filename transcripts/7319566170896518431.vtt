00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's water bath some potatoes.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.520
And I know what you're gonna say. Grace,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.680
you can't water bath potatoes.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.040
They're not a high acid food.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.040
I am a rebel canner,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.720
so I do what's comfortable in my kitchen.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.560
You do what's comfortable in your kitchen,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.920
but we are gonna be canning outside the USDA guidelines.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.800
So you're also gonna take a very large bowl.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.760
This is the bowl I'm using.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.280
You're gonna fill this up with

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.860
like room temperature water.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.920
Wash off your potatoes.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920
I'm using russet potatoes for this.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.760
And you're gonna peel them

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.640
and then chop them into about a 1 inch pieces.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.300
You're gonna drain off the potatoes

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.200
and you're gonna wash them at least three to four times

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.900
till your water runs clear.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.600
Once you're done that,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.200
you're gonna take some sterilized jars

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.840
and just put your potatoes in those sterilized jars.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.000
I am then taking some of my red men's real salt

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.840
and we're going to do half a teaspoon in quarts

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.080
and then one fourth teaspoon in the pint.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.080
Vinegar is optional,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.560
but it cuts down your processing time.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.960
So I did one tablespoon in quarts

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.660
and then half a tea tablespoon in pint.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.840
You're gonna then take a spatula

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.800
some sort in deep,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.520
bubble your jars.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.320
This is just getting all the air bubbles out.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.520
Clean the rims off with some vinegar,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.960
clear away any of that debris on there.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.200
And then put your lids on

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.400
and your rings on. Something

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.960
I like to Do is have a kettle with hot water on hand

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.320
next to my canner as I'm canning.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.960
Because when you're water back canning

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.420
for longer period of time,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.440
your water back canner,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.680
the water is going to evaporate.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.480
So this is just replacing that water

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.900
that is evaporating

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.880
at a rolling boil.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.120
You wanna place your jars in.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.440
I use a 2 inch head space for this process

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.360
for two hours.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.120
And then when I take them out,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.160
I let them sit for about five minutes in the canner,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.080
transfer to a towel

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.640
and let them sit for 12 to 24 hours.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.960
You wanna take the rings off after that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.467
and make sure they are sealed properly.
