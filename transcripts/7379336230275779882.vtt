When I asked my toddlers what they wanted for breakfast this morning,

00:03.241 --> 00:05.001
they both said donut holes.

00:05.002 --> 00:06.281
Since I don't make them a lot,

00:06.282 --> 00:09.501
I decided to surprise them and do it today.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.560
Started by adding some flour,

00:11.561 --> 00:13.001
baking powder, salt,

00:13.002 --> 00:15.041
some sugar into my bowl.

00:15.042 --> 00:16.121
In a separate bowl,

00:16.122 --> 00:18.641
whisk together an egg and some milk,

00:18.642 --> 00:21.361
and then combine my dry and wet ingredients

00:21.362 --> 00:22.961
before giving that a good mix

00:22.962 --> 00:25.741
and adding some melted butter in as well.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.400
Once that was all combined,

00:27.401 --> 00:30.641
I set it aside while I heated up my oil.

00:30.642 --> 00:34.001
I always opt for a coconut oil if I can.

00:34.002 --> 00:37.401
I transfer that over to the stove and let it come to temperature

00:37.402 --> 00:41.461
before forming my dough into little balls and frying them.

00:41.480 --> 00:42.640
Once they were golden brown,

00:42.641 --> 00:45.001
I transfer them over to my plate,

00:45.002 --> 00:48.921
and I did this in patches so I wouldn't over crowd my pot.

00:48.922 --> 00:50.361
Once all my dough was fried,

00:50.362 --> 00:53.081
I moved on to making a simple lemon glaze

00:53.082 --> 00:55.881
by combining some lemon juice and powdered sugar.

00:55.882 --> 00:57.721
Once that was all smooth and combined,

00:57.722 --> 01:01.441
I coated all of my doughnut holes in my icing

01:01.442 --> 01:03.921
before transferring them over to a plate.

01:03.922 --> 01:07.339
At this point, my kids were so excited to have breakfast.
