00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
These elderly Swiss women

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:03.841
sued the government for not doing enough to fight climate change

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:05.641
n one almost nine years ago.

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:08.841
In 2016, a group of Swiss women aged 64 and older

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:09.941
formed an organization

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.800
to fight for their fundamental right to life and health

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:14.541
in the face of the climate crisis.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.320
In 2020, the group of more than 2,000 women

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:20.161
sued the Swiss government at Europe's highest human rights court

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:22.541
for failing to act to reduce carbon emissions.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.760
The women argue that the governments in action

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:26.761
violated the rights of elderly women

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:30.401
who are particularly impacted by heat waves caused by climate change

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:31.941
due to their age and gender.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.160
On Tuesday, April 9th,

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:35.161
the court ruled in favor of the women,

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:37.921
finding that the Swiss government had failed to comply with his duties

00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:40.021
to fight climate change and cut emissions.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.080
This is the first time that a human rights court has ruled that

00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:45.001
protecting people from the effects of climate change

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:46.621
is a basic human right.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.320
Switzerland must now revise its climate targets and policy

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:51.421
to take greater action to cut emissions.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.400
The verdict, which cannot be appealed,

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.641
also serves as a legal president in Europe

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:58.361
for people to sue their governments over climate inaction.

00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:00.201
Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg

00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:01.801
celebrated the victory with the women,

00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:03.521
saying it is only the beginning of the journey

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:05.301
towards achieving climate justice.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.400
Speaking after the rolling,

00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:08.401
the women said they were not doing this for themselves,

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.681
but for the sake of their children.

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:10.961
And their children's children.
