00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.480
Yes, you're right.

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:04.101
You cannot wash eggs and put them on this rack.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.600
If you wash the.

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:07.281
The eggs,

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:10.321
the protected bloom that's on top of the eggs gets washed away.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:12.921
Now, chicken eggs have thousands of pores.

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:14.441
So if you wash the bloom off,

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:15.981
which is protecting the pores,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.780
um, bacteria gets inside.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.240
So, yeah,

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.161
you can leave a washed egg on the counter for a few days,

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:21.001
but anything after that,

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:22.261
the egg will start to rot.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.000
So the key to this is to keep your chicken coop clean,

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.341
so then you get clean eggs.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.840
Now, that doesn't mean I clean my chicken coop often.

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:30.701
I barely clean this thing,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.940
but I have it set up in a way that my eggs don't get dirty.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.600
Right now, we actually needs cleaning

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.821
because they like to sit out here and people over the next box.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.460
But inside,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.920
I use a sand bedding,

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:43.561
which you can see.

00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:44.961
I do actually need to sweep the poop.

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:46.401
It's been like that for a few weeks.

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:48.141
And the nest boxes are over here.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.640
The key to a successful setup is to have your perches

00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:53.201
higher than your nest boxes.

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:54.961
If they're not higher than your nest boxes,

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:58.241
your chickens will perch in your nest boxes and shit in there,

00:00:58.242 --> 00:00:59.379
and then you have shit on your egg.
