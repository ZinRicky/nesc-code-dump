00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
I'm a financial advisor who specializes in divorce.

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.961
The only way a triad marriage ends well for the wife

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:07.121
is if the husband dies before he meets the new woman

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.901
with a life insurance policy.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.420
Not my words. Read the comment

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.760
from women who have the lived experience

00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:20.161
to experts in every field surrounding divorce and marriage

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:23.061
and financial and anything you could fucking imagine.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.200
People who are removed from the situation

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:28.881
and who have no interest in what happens to you

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:31.161
will tell you the dead ass truth.

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:33.681
That the tried marriage is only gonna serve the husband.

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:37.141
Traditional roles only serve the husband.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.280
And in the end,

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:41.361
the person who's most vulnerable and most at risk is the woman.

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:44.821
In those situations, the people closest to you,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.560
who are gonna keep you to these, like,

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:49.881
societal standards, they're gonna push you into this shit.

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.561
The boyfriend that you're dating,

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:54.501
who's gonna benefit from your unpaid labor.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.760
Of course he's gonna push you into a tribe marriage.

00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:00.921
Of course he's gonna sell you the fucking dream.

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:04.581
He wants you to become his personal servant.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.060
Bang! Made housekeeper,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.800
nanny, everything.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.841
If it sounds too good to be true,

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:13.041
it usually is. So, again,

00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:15.921
I'm gonna go back to the same thing I always say.

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:18.801
We don't raise our little boys to say, hey,

00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:20.641
when you grow up, you know,

00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:22.601
just find a friend that you can make an arrangement with

00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:24.401
and live with him. That's totally available.

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:27.561
Option for life. You do not need to go to college,

00:01:27.562 --> 00:01:31.181
get an education, learn any of this mumbo jumbo bullshit.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.320
We would never raise our sons that way.

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:36.161
And we are doing our daughters a huge disservice by.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.601
By telling them that their greatest service in life

00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:41.481
is not to just serve a man.

00:01:41.482 --> 00:01:43.181
There's. We have so much more to offer.
