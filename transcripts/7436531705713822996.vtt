00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.920
if I had to write the story of my life today

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:03.400
it would be a very simple story

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:04.840
centred around a main character

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:06.415
who has to clean all of the things 

00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:07.000
over and over

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:07.425
every day 

00:00:07.426 --> 00:00:08.320
until the end of time

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:09.978
and today's narrative would be written 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:11.680
much like the rest of them if I'm honest

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:12.560
except plot twist

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:14.866
there's a shining new love interest in the form 

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:16.260
of Ecostoreâ€™s Refill Concentrates 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.393
and the new protagonists are benevolent 

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:19.640
and extremely easy to use

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:21.828
just pop them in a clean sprayer bottle 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.960
add 450ml of water and you're away

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.706
doesn't even need to be an Ecostore bottle 

00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:26.560
if you don't have one

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:28.240
side note and totally unrelated

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:29.160
but is it obvious

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.287
I've been disassociating a little bit much 

00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:32.920
on cleantok & booktok lately?

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:34.800
anyway I've just got the kids out of my hair

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:35.764
I mean off to school

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:38.560
 and every weekday morning around here looks much the same

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:40.716
I like to try and take a quick 30 first thing 

00:00:40.717 --> 00:00:41.560
to reset the house

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:43.320
no matter how busy the day ahead is looking

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.880
it sets me up for a productive day

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.120
and I get a few blissful hours where I'm not surrounded by total chaos

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.000
which really helps with the old headspace

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.640
I've hit the kitchen with the Ecostore multi-purpose cleaner

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:55.040
which smells really good and is antibacterial

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:55.880
I dressed the table

00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:57.654
which deludes me into believing that I've 

00:00:57.655 --> 00:00:58.880
actually got my life together

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:00.120
before tackling the console

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:02.640
which is collecting dust as if it's going out of fashion

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.440
then I swapped to a clean microfiber cause that one was toast

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:07.549
and also so I could tackle the mirrors with the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.435
Ecostore glass cleaner for a streak free finish 

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:11.440
I did the mirror in the dining room and the bathroom

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:13.880
before switching to the antibacterial bathroom cleaner

00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:14.960
for the rest of the surfaces

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.680
okay so I've been using this range for my entire adult life

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:19.840
which feels like a really long time actually

00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:21.463
but they do make really effective 

00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:23.040
environmentally conscious products

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.680
and they're also constantly innovating

00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:27.320
these concentrates are just as good as a full size bottle

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.275
but they reduce plastic waste by 90% 

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:30.280
and they're cheaper

00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:31.513
find them at your local supermarket 

00:01:31.514 --> 00:01:32.542
and let me know what you think!
