00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.960
Something that I don't get a lot is PR,

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:05.501
but today a PR package showed up on my doorstep,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.780
and I think that this is going to be the best PR I've ever received.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.400
We are starting off so strong with this adorable Ralph Lauren hat.

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.601
I think this is so cute. For fall,

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.481
we have this super cute Kate Spade tumbler.

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:23.361
It's giving

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:26.841
Coastal grandmother bag full of goodies from Bumble and Bumble.

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:29.041
I can't wait to try them all out on my hair.

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:32.281
J. Cruz sent these adorable bow earrings.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.621
Do you know what I don't have?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.960
Bow earrings. Do you know what else I don't have?

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:39.841
Any Tory Burch at all. Giving all of the beach vibes.

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:42.701
An MK Airpod holder.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.860
Stop! They're pink

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.060
obsessed.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.080
I'm sugared to my very core.

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:55.881
Tulsa Premium Outlets sent me my first coach.

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:56.841
This is adorable.

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:59.321
I can't wait to go shopping at the Tulsa Premium Outlets.

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:00.294
Hope to see you there!
