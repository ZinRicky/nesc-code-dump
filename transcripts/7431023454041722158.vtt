00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
I don't feed my kids candy because they're loaded with food dyes,

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:05.721
high fructose corn syrup, extreme amounts of refined sugar,

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:08.721
and toxic chemicals. Which is why I'm making them homemade Reese's.

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:11.121
Just because store bought candy is pretty much off limits

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:12.761
doesn't mean the homemade candy is.

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.281
Reese's takes just a few ingredients,

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.641
all nourishing and nutrient dense,

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:17.921
and we can enjoy them whenever we want to do this.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:20.481
I roasted some walnuts, as peanuts are high in aflatoxins,

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.201
and then whipped up some homemade chocolate

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:24.081
which we all licked up pretty darn good.

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:27.001
Meow! This homemade chocolate was just five real ingredients

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.641
and took seconds to make. Next,

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:31.081
I lined a mini muffin tray with mini muffin liners.

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:33.641
I drizzled a little bit of my chocolate into the bottom of each,

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:36.081
then stuck those in the freezer for a few minutes until firm.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.480
I used a food processor to turn the roasted walnuts into walnut butter

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:42.281
and then rated the Reese's filling with the walnut butter, butter,

00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:43.761
coconut sugar, and coconut flour.

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:45.321
I stirred the mixture until smooth

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:47.241
and set it in the freezer until firm.

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:48.881
Rolled out little pieces of walnut filling

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.961
and placed each little ball on top of the firm chocolate lined cups.

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:53.881
I then went through and flattened the ball slightly,

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:56.601
making sure to keep the disc smaller and radius than the chocolate.

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:57.441
Lastly, I went through

00:00:57.442 --> 00:00:59.961
and filled each of the cups with the remaining chocolate.

00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:02.641
They set in the freezer for 15 minutes until hardened.

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:05.501
Then we devoured a few and saved the rest for another day.
