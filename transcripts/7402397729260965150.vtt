00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.920
Today's Anatomy lesson with a whole lot of.

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:03.761
Started off listening to the Sassafras novel,

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:04.961
which was all about the backbone.

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:06.721
And then we made our own edible backbones

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:09.441
using honeycomb cereal and gummy lifesavers.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.961
My kids absolutely love this activity.

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:13.361
As a crunchy mom who never buys food with food dye in it,

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:14.561
they thought this was awesome.

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:16.041
Yes, I did let them try them.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:17.921
And then we took a little field trip over to our chiropractor

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:18.881
to learn from the expert.

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:21.241
Doctor Mark is a family friend and very passionate about what he does,

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:22.921
so he was so thrilled to talk about this with the kid.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.441
He even sent us home with a life size skeleton who we named Skelly.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:26.901
Welcome to the family, Skelly.
