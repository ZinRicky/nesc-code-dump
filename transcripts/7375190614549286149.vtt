00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
So we had a recorded vote on our colleague,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.340
the MLA for Kirkfield Park,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.480
his Bill on trans and two spirited day

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:18.601
a visibility important to know that our colleague is uh,

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:20.881
the first trans uh person,

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:25.201
first trans man ever elected in Manitoba's history

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:31.141
just in October of 2023, an extraordinary moment for Manitoba.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.120
And so today's vote, recorded vote

00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:40.601
to stand up in the house and show your support for trans manitobins,

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:43.241
for two spirited manitobins. Again,

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.401
we're also in in the,

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:50.001
the start of Pride Month and it's an opportunity to show manitobins,

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.101
all manitobins that they're valued,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.260
that they're respected,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.580
that we've got compassion,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.040
that we have love and that we will always stand with Manitobans.

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:02.701
And two spirited Manitobans,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.020
the member for Steinbeck, the member for Borderland,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.700
the member for LA Verandre and the member for Springfield Rashad

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.860
all got up in the house and stood up and voted against Manitobans,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.600
voted against Trans Manitobans,

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:26.941
voted against two spirited Manitobans.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.520
They have trans and two spirited constituents in their constituencies

00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:35.321
that they represent, that they're elected,

00:01:35.322 --> 00:01:38.561
that they're paid good money to represent

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:40.681
in this Manitoba Legislative Assembly.

00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:41.661
They do,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.420
those four men got up in the chamber and voted against some Manitobans

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.840
humanity. They didn't even see them enough or respect them enough

00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:56.441
or care about them enough

00:01:56.442 --> 00:01:58.561
or have compassion enough for them

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:02.861
or see them enough to vote for their humanity.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.380
That's a sad day for Manitoba history here.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.820
And as I've always Said about the PCs when they show you who they are,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.040
believe them. For the last eight years

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:22.521
they have shown us over and over and over and over and over again

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:26.661
including a mere couple of hours ago who they are.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.160
As the minister responsible for gender equity,

00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:38.461
for the minister responsible for uh our 2S LGBTQI relatives,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.000
I am the minister responsible

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:43.761
and I take great exception to those four men

00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:45.921
getting up in the chamber this morning

00:02:45.922 --> 00:02:48.781
and voting against their humanity.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.820
It is shameful and I hope that they'll do what's right and apologize.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.000
We have an ongoing savage genocide against indigenous women,

00:02:59.001 --> 00:02:59.321
girls

00:02:59.322 --> 00:03:04.021
and two spirit across our territories from coast to coast to coast

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.340
because for generations

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.840
people who sat in these very rooms

00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:15.561
in that very chamber didn't think much about indigenous women

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:16.781
girls are too spirited,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.640
didn't give consideration to the Protection of indigenous women,

00:03:20.641 --> 00:03:22.061
girls and too spirited.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.860
If you're gonna run for office and you're gonna get elected,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.220
you should care about all of your constituents

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.620
and you should be actively working against harm

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.300
so that when you come to estimates

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.760
and you ask the minister responsible about m m

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:42.241
I W G2S and what she's doing on 24 7

00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:43.321
make the connection

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:46.981
that what happened this morning is connected to that violence.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.020
There is consequence, there is deadly consequence

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.620
when you have people elected like the member for borderland,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.240
the member for Steinbeck,

00:03:57.241 --> 00:04:01.441
the member for Laver Andre and The member for Springfield Rashad,

00:04:01.442 --> 00:04:05.361
who cannot even get up and support

00:04:05.362 --> 00:04:10.921
and vote in favour of a Bill that gives humanity to trans

00:04:10.922 --> 00:04:15.601
into spirited Manitobans and then to double down on it.

00:04:15.602 --> 00:04:20.001
The member for uh, Laverandre just double down in the hallways.

00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:24.001
He doubled down on that hate and that discrimination

00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:26.761
and that real harm. So,

00:04:26.762 --> 00:04:27.821
to me, it's like,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.500
it's quite insulting that on the one hand,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.200
members opposite are asking me about m, m,

00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:33.641
I, W,

00:04:33.642 --> 00:04:36.341
G, and on the other getting up to support harm.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.520
The member for Portugal

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:42.021
Prairie sat on the committee for my colleague's Bill.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.020
And the member said that he was deeply moved,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.140
deeply moved by what he heard.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.680
And yet

00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:55.561
he still let his caucus vote in a way that show disrespect and harm

00:04:55.562 --> 00:05:00.761
and hate and disregard. You can't on the one hand trying back track,

00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:02.241
but you, you signed on to it,

00:05:02.242 --> 00:05:04.361
you got elected. And then,

00:05:04.362 --> 00:05:05.361
and then on the other hand,

00:05:05.362 --> 00:05:06.561
sitting committee and say

00:05:06.562 --> 00:05:08.681
you're deeply moved by hearing Manitobans

00:05:08.682 --> 00:05:11.161
who came to present at committee,

00:05:11.162 --> 00:05:14.241
who shared their heart, their spirit,

00:05:14.242 --> 00:05:16.501
their lives, their experiences,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.400
their joys, their pain,

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:21.441
their trauma. You can't sit through that

00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:27.981
and then sit in a caucus with four individuals that we know about

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.420
and be okay with that.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.420
There were many that weren't there that didn't vote.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.580
Was that strategic?

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.680
Probably. Who knows?

00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:37.641
We're talking about violence against women.

00:05:37.642 --> 00:05:40.121
We're talking about violence against children.

00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:42.121
We're talking About too spirited.

00:05:42.122 --> 00:05:43.001
We're talking about m, m,

00:05:43.002 --> 00:05:43.401
I, W,

00:05:43.402 --> 00:05:49.661
G2S here this afternoon. You cannot disconnect those questions

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.040
from what happened in the chamber

00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:55.201
this morning. They are intimately connected.

00:05:55.202 --> 00:05:57.121
They are fundamentally connected.

00:05:57.122 --> 00:06:02.361
And it really is quite disconcerting that the member for Portage

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.761
La Prairie will sit here and say that he's in support

00:06:05.762 --> 00:06:07.601
and was moved by Manitobans,

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:08.681
but at the same time

00:06:08.682 --> 00:06:13.161
be perfectly okay with his four caucus members and possibly more

00:06:13.162 --> 00:06:15.801
voting against the humanity of Manitobans.

00:06:15.802 --> 00:06:17.381
It just doesn't jive.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.580
The member for Dawson Trail said that this was about shaming.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.260
This isn't about shaming anyone.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.640
This is about pointing out what

00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:29.861
elected members in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.260
what they stand for. Talk about shaming.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.220
I don't care if that's what you wanna do,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.440
be you, do you whatever,

00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:40.621
but live with the consequences.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.560
There are consequences when we participate in harm.

00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:46.241
And the consequences is that

00:06:46.242 --> 00:06:50.741
from now until the day I am no longer elected,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.960
I will never let every single member of the PC caucus

00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:59.101
forget what they did during the 2023 provincial election

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.140
and what they did this morning on May 30th, 2024, ever.
