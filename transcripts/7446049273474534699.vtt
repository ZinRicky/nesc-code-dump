00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.640
everyday I get on the internet

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:04.640
and I see another mediocre man with podcast who hates women

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:06.640
talking about the state of dating in the world

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:10.000
talking about how women are gold diggers or they're living in their masculine

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:11.680
they're never gonna have children

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:15.080
and that basically women have ruined dating a marriage

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.120
and as an outsider someone who is married

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.620
I really only hear one thing

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.520
men created the currency at the dating market

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.880
now they don't like the exchange rate

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:23.920
because being a financial provider was much more important

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:25.760
when women weren't allowed to provide for themselves

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:26.960
because when those were the terms

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:28.800
women were valued for their beauty and fertility

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:31.300
and men were valued for their status and money

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.680
and in some ways these are still the terms

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:34.960
women are absolutely still judged for their physical appearance

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:36.320
in ways that men are not however

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:39.160
women now have the opportunity and ability to provide for themselves

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:42.420
so if beauty and money are the two currencies of the dating marketplace

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.080
and women can provide both for themselves

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:47.280
where men cannot provide female company of fertility to themselves

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.820
the supply and demand and the exchange rate has shifted

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.000
and when you factor in the way the economy has been going

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.640
fewer and fewer men are able to even do the provider role

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:57.620
so their stock is down and someone gave them a microphone
