00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
The jacket,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.700
it's kind of like a shirt,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.480
kind of like a jacket.

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:10.081
So you can layer it and put it underneath other stuff

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:15.221
and be like, for triple warm and triple comfortable watch.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.600
And it looks like a three quarter pullover.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.355
Put this guy over top.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.800
See,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.160
now it just looks like my shirt.

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:26.701
You can put my jacket on top,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.680
and if at any point it becomes too much,

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:32.321
I can take this guy off and just have the shacket.

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:34.721
It still has the pockets. I can also just be like,

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.561
I'm hot, I'm ready to go.

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:37.361
Like,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.500
it's a great layering piece.
