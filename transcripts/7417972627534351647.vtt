00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.760
I absolutely love the all about reading curriculum.

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:03.561
It has been a game changer for teaching my homeschoolers how to read.

00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:05.161
But it is kind of expensive.

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:07.001
I think the whole thing, the teachers manual,

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:09.081
and everything that comes with it is close to $300.

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:10.681
And if you're a homeschool family living on one income,

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:11.841
that's probably not feasible.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.520
this is something that I do to make this a little bit more reasonable.

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:16.081
For starters, I only have the teachers manual,

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.081
work cards, and the readers.

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:18.281
And honestly, you don't need the work cards.

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:19.721
If you just wanna start with something,

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:20.641
start with the teachers guide

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:22.601
and you can make pretty much everything at home.

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:27.561
So the every lesson shows you what the word cards are.

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:29.401
So again, you can make them on index cards,

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:32.721
no big deal. But there are some activities that you probably can't do,

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:33.681
like some of the games and stuff,

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:35.761
because it doesn't show you everything that comes with it.

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:38.641
But the extra activity sheets are listed right here.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:42.081
And let me show you an activity of how I did this without the activity.

00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:43.641
The activity for this lesson was a word flipper,

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.321
so I use banana gram tiles to do the same thing.

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:46.681
I made the UFF ending with tiles

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:48.841
and then I said different words and my son changed the beginning tile.

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:50.361
This is the same concept as the word flipper,

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.761
except I use things I already had and didn't buy the Activity sheet.

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:53.961
This is just one way to cut cost

00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:55.670
to make the all about reading curriculum affordable.
