00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.360
men will say like oh

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:04.700
you're dressing for me you're dressing for the male gaze

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.300
if you didn't want attention

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.960
why'd you dress like that

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:15.020
and like they will truly believe that with their whole little hearts

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.480
but the thing is it's kind of true

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:21.240
like I do I do

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.920
I do take it into account

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.760
but not in the way you think

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:29.440
like I will not wear makeup for men

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:33.100
I will not wear a crop top for men

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.840
I will not shave my legs for men

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:41.880
because I wanna send a clear message that I do not wanna be mess with today

00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:44.220
I do not have the time today

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.720
I don't wanna be perceived by men today

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:48.760
I don't have the energy

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:53.040
and some days I do have the energy to just put up with it

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:57.720
but most days I don't and I will find myself dressing sluttier than anything

00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:06.260
if I am going to a safe queer space or a safe female dominated

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.440
like the girls the gays

00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:13.820
the gays space that's when I will be my skankiest

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.200
so in a six side way they're kinda right

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.440
but also just like so so wrong

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:24.420
there is truly no greater compliment than a gay man saying that you're hot

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.960
like I will truly not consider a compliment

00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:31.880
a compliment from a straight man

00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:36.060
it goes over my head but if a gay man

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.320
there is nothing better in this world than a gay man or a girl saying

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:44.060
that you're pretty I still have a catalog of all the compliments

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.400
in my head that I've ever received from gay men

00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:49.300
I could list them out now to you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.800
I won't but I I

00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:55.380
I could but I could not tell you a single compliment

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.960
that I've gotten from a straight man

00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:02.040
in fact I could list off some nagging cause that lives rent free in my head

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:03.160
but not a single compliment

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:03.920
it just not

00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:05.260
cause I haven't gotten one

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.540
but because obviously

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.700
but because they don't mean anything they don't stick
