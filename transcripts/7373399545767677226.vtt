00:00.040 --> 00:02.080
Every Saturday night it's movie night,

00:02.081 --> 00:05.761
and there's no movie night that's complete without a good

00:05.762 --> 00:06.881
selection of snacks.

00:06.882 --> 00:10.201
So I started by making some cookies and cream ice cream.

00:10.202 --> 00:13.881
Combine some milk and sugar with some vanilla and heavy cream

00:13.882 --> 00:16.801
before putting it in my ice cream Turner to turn.

00:16.802 --> 00:18.621
It reached soft serve consistency,

00:18.720 --> 00:20.320
I added in my cookies,

00:20.321 --> 00:22.801
let that go until everything was incorporated.

00:22.802 --> 00:25.321
I don't know what it is about cookies and cream ice cream.

00:25.322 --> 00:27.201
It's so good to me right now.

00:27.202 --> 00:28.841
Pop that in the freezer to chill

00:28.842 --> 00:31.621
while I got started on making some pretzel dough.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.880
He loves pretzel bites, so I made these for him,

00:34.881 --> 00:36.361
combined all of my ingredients,

00:36.362 --> 00:40.121
and then kneaded the dough for letting it rise for about 30 minutes.

00:40.122 --> 00:40.721
In the meantime,

00:40.722 --> 00:43.241
I got started on making some gummy worms,

00:43.242 --> 00:46.301
so I blended up some strawberries and raspberries.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.160
In the meantime,

00:47.161 --> 00:50.481
I heated up some apple juice and gelatin in my pot

00:50.482 --> 00:51.961
until it was all dissolved

00:51.962 --> 00:53.401
for combining the two

00:53.402 --> 00:55.321
and then spooning it into my mold.

00:55.322 --> 00:58.801
I let these set in the fridge while I worked on my pretzel dough.

00:58.802 --> 01:00.241
After about 30 minutes,

01:00.242 --> 01:04.441
I cut it up in six pieces and rolled those out into little ropes.

01:04.442 --> 01:06.481
Once I did that with all of my six pieces,

01:06.482 --> 01:09.481
I cut them up into smaller bite size pieces.

01:09.482 --> 01:11.281
They don't all have to be perfect,

01:11.282 --> 01:14.841
and I dropped them in some boiling water with some baking soda.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.041
Before pulling them out,

01:16.042 --> 01:19.361
salting them, and then baking them until they were golden brown.

01:19.362 --> 01:20.721
All those were cooling off.

01:20.722 --> 01:23.421
I got my gummy worms out of the fridge.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.280
I wanted them to be slightly sour,

01:25.281 --> 01:27.561
so I sprinkled them with some citric acid

01:27.562 --> 01:30.561
and then moved on to the last thing I was gonna make

01:30.562 --> 01:31.561
with some popcorn.

01:31.562 --> 01:34.961
No movie night is complete without a big bowl of buttered popcorn.

01:34.962 --> 01:37.921
Drizzled it with melted butter and some flaky sea salt

01:37.922 --> 01:40.601
before I pulled my ice cream out and served us up

01:40.602 --> 01:41.921
a bowl of that as well.

01:41.922 --> 01:42.521
At this point

01:42.522 --> 01:46.301
I was so ready to go watch the movie and eat all of the snacks.
