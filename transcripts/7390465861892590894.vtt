If you're homeschooling your kids this summer

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:03.121
and you're doing CBC Words,

00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:04.481
this is a great way to practice.

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:05.561
It comes with this cool little pop it

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:08.221
and a whole stack of cards to get practicing with.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.740
It also comes with plenty of dry erase pens.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.960
Now, there's a few different ways you can practice with this,

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.861
but we started out just standing out the word,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.280
adding the letters into the pop it,

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:18.561
and then by finally adding the missing vowel.

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:21.561
And this was very useful to help him practice with his CBC words.

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:23.252
And there's plenty of clause to practice with.
