00:00.120 --> 00:04.160
One of our favorite things to eat in the fall time

00:04.161 --> 00:05.401
when the apples are there

00:05.402 --> 00:09.101
peak here in Utah is homemade apple sauce.

00:09.160 --> 00:11.520
And I make mine very simple.

00:11.521 --> 00:14.621
I just core my apples, I leave my peels on,

00:14.760 --> 00:16.680
I put a little bit of lemon juice,

00:16.681 --> 00:18.741
and then we cook that down for a little bit.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.480
And while that was cooking,

00:20.481 --> 00:23.201
we also made apple cider doughnuts today.

00:23.202 --> 00:27.361
So I added all the dry ingredients to one bowl,

00:27.362 --> 00:30.281
and then we added all the wet ingredients to one bowl,

00:30.282 --> 00:35.081
which is melted butter and sourdough and eggs,

00:35.082 --> 00:36.261
vanilla,

00:37.040 --> 00:40.000
and also applesauce is a key ingredient.

00:40.001 --> 00:42.841
So we had finished applesauce at this point.

00:42.842 --> 00:44.361
Miss Wardrobe falling asleep.

00:44.362 --> 00:49.341
We made the transfer, then we added our cooked down apple cider.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.000
Can we combine the wet ingredients with the dry

00:53.001 --> 00:55.201
and you just mix that until combined

00:55.202 --> 00:58.101
so you don't wanna over mix your batter.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.120
And then we made them into donut shapes and got frying them.

01:02.121 --> 01:04.841
I used a beef tallow to fry them in today

01:04.842 --> 01:09.601
and it worked perfectly. They were so fluffy and turned out beautifully.

01:09.602 --> 01:13.301
And then we coated them in some maple sugar and cinnamon.

01:14.040 --> 01:18.240
And that's what we had for dinner today

01:18.241 --> 01:21.081
was warm applesauce and apple cider donuts.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.441
I'm not complaining because it was so good.

01:23.442 --> 01:26.241
It was 10 out of 10. The perfect fall treat.

01:26.242 --> 01:29.501
And my kitchen smelled amazing.

01:30.800 --> 01:34.380
Was like a fall candle in the kitchen. We loved it.
