00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.020
look at my new T-shirt

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.360
did you know that I love Zuko

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:08.481
did you know that I recently only now Learned there's like

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:10.701
actual genuine beef between like

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.960
Zuko and Katara and then Aang Katara

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.161
like shippers

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:15.821
it's Kaang and Zutara

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.360
and like

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:20.401
I legitimately did not realize how much beef there was in the fandom because

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.360
I've been a fan of after Last Airbender since I was

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:24.281
you know a child

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:25.361
like a literal child

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:27.621
and I've always been a Zutara girl always

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.560
um and I posted like a little TikTok cause I did a rewatch like last month

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:32.681
and I posted a

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:34.661
like a little TikTok edit of the two of them

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.080
and ah they were calling me like a colonizer sympathizer in my comments

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:39.641
they were like

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:40.781
what do you mean

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.080
you're supporting a relationship between a colonizer and the colonized

00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:45.901
I was like

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.320
whoa whoa whoa

00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:49.441
everyone calm down

00:00:49.442 --> 00:00:52.061
everyone calm down whoa

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.600
I am just talking about the ship that I've been a fan of

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:57.201
and the thing is

00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:58.161
I know it's not cannon

00:00:58.162 --> 00:00:59.561
I don't even care if it's cannon or not

00:00:59.562 --> 00:01:02.841
like I like making up little things in my brain like whether or not it's cannon

00:01:02.842 --> 00:01:04.761
it's cannon here and like Zutara

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:05.601
it doesn't have to be canon

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:06.801
it's canon in here

00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:10.041
but I did not realize how much flak people were gonna have

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:11.261
like I get it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.100
Katar and Aang or Canon fine whatever

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.080
I can still like Zutara and I'm a little bit of a hater

00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:19.381
deal with it sorry

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.320
but like oh my god

00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:21.161
I love this man

00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:22.161
I'm sorry like

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:24.081
I've always been an enemy's lovers kind of girl

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:26.081
I've always loved a redemption archive

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:28.321
always loved an emo little shit even

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:30.121
even those 9 years old right

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:35.121
like I don't understand how y'all will give like more Grace to Iroh

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:37.161
the literal war criminal

00:01:37.162 --> 00:01:40.521
then you will to the 16** year old that was abused by his family

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:41.281
like I again

00:01:41.282 --> 00:01:43.921
I'm not justifying any of the action

00:01:43.922 --> 00:01:44.861
I just

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.180
let me like Zutara please

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.760
that's the only thing I

00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:52.421
I just didn't realize we had so much beef that's all
