00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.320
You're married, but you have to leave your baby to go to work now

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:05.121
because it takes two incomes to run a home.

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:09.801
I wanna touch on programming that we receive from American news.

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:13.321
They create these little mantras that are told to us repeatedly,

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:16.041
like during 2020, this is the new normal.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.121
The new normal. I heard it all the time.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.361
I went to school for marketing.

00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:20.641
I know what a mantra looks like

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:22.321
and I know what programming looks like.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.521
They did the same thing with the whole,

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:26.461
it takes two incomes to run a household.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.040
Are things expensive? Yes.

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:29.281
Is inflation out of control?

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:31.301
Yes. I work in financial advising.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.420
I looked at hundreds of people's financial statements.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.040
We practice what was called finance,

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:37.481
or holistic financial advising.

00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:40.281
So we took an account every single aspect of their lives,

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:42.621
even your YouTube subscription.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.920
Individual average income for Americans is about $56,000.

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:51.981
Even our line for poverty is much higher than that of other nations.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.240
If I told you what my husband and I lived off of

00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:56.441
after I had my first child

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:57.901
so that I could stay home,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.640
you would be literally shook.

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:02.881
If you are married and wanna stay home with your child,

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:04.801
here are some things you can do.

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:08.081
I cloth diaper. I bought an entire pack off Amazon for $200,

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:10.161
and it will last him till he is 2 years old.

00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:11.441
200 bucks, y'all.

00:01:11.442 --> 00:01:14.441
And I used my MLM side hustle money for that.

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:16.281
There's almost nothing I buy for my kids

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:18.521
that is probably not off Facebook Marketplace.

00:01:18.522 --> 00:01:19.841
All the necessities that we needed

00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:22.561
we got from the first initial baby shower.

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:25.761
I birthed at home. This last birth cost us $3,000.

00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:29.461
An average birth in a hospital without insurance is about $10,000.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.240
If you have a C section, which is almost,

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:32.641
quite frankly, nowadays inevitable,

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:35.361
in a hospital, you're looking at about $50,000.

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.441
With complications, $100,000.

00:01:37.442 --> 00:01:38.481
Now, just to be clear,

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:41.161
I birthed at home because of personal reasons

00:01:41.162 --> 00:01:43.901
and I'm a huge naturopathic health fanatic

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
and I don't agree with what hospitals do for mothers.

00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.681
That's completely different video.

00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:52.821
But it was an added bonus of how incredibly affordable

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.840
affordable it was.

00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:57.241
I just bought a $500 Bob double stroller off Facebook Marketplace

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:59.481
for 50 bucks and I hand sewed in the strap

00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:01.161
so that both my children could fit in it.

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:04.321
My husband is about to shoot an Elk this weekend for 500 bucks

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:06.041
and that will feed us for the next year.

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.561
If you and your husband or just your husband

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:13.281
worked your entire lives and you paid all your taxes and dead gum it,

00:02:13.282 --> 00:02:15.961
I completely support you getting your state's Medicaid.

00:02:15.962 --> 00:02:19.121
All the benefits that are allotted to single mothers in most states

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:20.521
like Texas and New Mexico,

00:02:20.522 --> 00:02:22.801
you have access to as a family

00:02:22.802 --> 00:02:25.381
if you are running your household off a single income.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.880
This is not forever, guys.

00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:31.421
This is just to get your children from The smallest state of infancy

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.260
where they need and depend on you the most.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.920
Until maybe you decide you go back to work

00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:38.281
when they're two or three years old.

00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:40.021
I breastfeed, so we didn't need formula.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.960
I fast and eat an all carnivore diet,

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:42.481
which, by the way,

00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:43.721
has doubled my milk supply.

00:02:43.722 --> 00:02:45.721
I hand mill our own bread at home.

00:02:45.722 --> 00:02:47.821
We only eat out on special occasions.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.980
We have not traveled with the babies.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.320
Yes, I had to say no to some weddings.

00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:56.061
I had to say no to some out of state baby showers and graduation.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.600
It's worth the sacrifice to me.

00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:00.241
My husband had just started a business,

00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:02.801
so we were at the very beginning stages of a business

00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:04.721
where everything went into it.

00:03:04.722 --> 00:03:06.041
And I told him, don't worry,

00:03:06.042 --> 00:03:07.201
I will hunker down at home,

00:03:07.202 --> 00:03:09.961
I will clip coupons. He does the grocery shopping for us,

00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:12.801
so I don't even need my car like 90% of the time.

00:03:12.802 --> 00:03:14.281
So there goes your gas.

00:03:14.282 --> 00:03:18.321
If you are pregnant and your husband brings in about 39,000 a year,

00:03:18.322 --> 00:03:20.001
that is the poverty threshold

00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.261
to start receiving benefits from the state.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.240
And do not feel guilty about this.

00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:26.841
We have, quite frankly, sent billions to Ukraine,

00:03:26.842 --> 00:03:31.001
billions to Israel, billions to the people coming across our borders.

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.881
If you worked, you paid into that

00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:33.681
and you deserve it.

00:03:33.682 --> 00:03:36.681
And it is just to get you through the beginning stages

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:40.641
of their infancy. There are options to stay home,

00:03:40.642 --> 00:03:42.161
And live off a single income.

00:03:42.162 --> 00:03:46.001
We are so brainwashed into thinking that we just can't do it

00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:49.241
because the news stations and the media keep telling us, oh,

00:03:49.242 --> 00:03:50.321
it takes two to run a household.

00:03:50.322 --> 00:03:51.401
It takes two to run a household.

00:03:51.402 --> 00:03:52.441
It, quite frankly,

00:03:52.442 --> 00:03:54.881
from my experience and many other women that I know,

00:03:54.882 --> 00:03:57.721
it is not always true. Now again,

00:03:57.722 --> 00:03:59.441
I am talking to women that are married.

00:03:59.442 --> 00:04:01.681
I have advice for single mothers.

00:04:01.682 --> 00:04:03.961
Um, that would be a completely different video, though.

00:04:03.962 --> 00:04:07.561
But do not limit yourself and what you think you are capable of doing

00:04:07.562 --> 00:04:11.861
because of this programming we receive in our crap culture nowadays.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.800
You wanna stay home with your baby's mama?

00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:16.081
You do it. You can do it.

00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:18.041
Think outside the box and get creative.

00:04:18.042 --> 00:04:20.021
Talk to a holistic financial advisor.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.060
I can hook you up with one for free.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.020
You do not need two incomes to raise a family.
