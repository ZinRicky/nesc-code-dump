00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.200
watch this steam cleaner just power blast off all this

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:11.540
like cooked on grease and grime on my grill that has never been cleaned in like

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.160
two years and look how easy

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:15.720
you know I sprayed the cleaner on

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:16.800
let it sit for a few minutes

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.360
and then I didn't have to scrub or anything

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.420
this thing did all the work

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.880
look at the difference look at it do it in action

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:24.800
and then look at the difference

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:27.880
from the grill grate before to the grill grate after

00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:32.200
it is unbelievable and all you gotta do is just stand there

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.520
no effort this little tiny thing does all the work

00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:37.620
