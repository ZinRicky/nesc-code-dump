00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
There was a homeschooling mum.

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:02.761
I'm always trying to find some cool,

00:00:02.762 --> 00:00:05.241
fun ways to get the lesson across to my kids.

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:06.801
Me and my older son Bowie

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:10.241
are starting a geology unit study and he's super excited.

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.941
He loves rugs. What boy doesn't?

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.600
Now, I truly believe when you have something physically in front of you,

00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:17.521
it's a lot easier to retain the information.

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:19.801
So to make this unit study even more fun,

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:21.941
we have the rocks, we have the sand,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.440
and it's gonna be such an amazing lesson.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.841
These are available on TikTok Shop.

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:27.441
They come in a multiple different sizes,

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:28.641
even have specialist ones

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:30.721
that have certain types of crystals and rocks in them.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:31.881
I'm gonna put this in the link

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:33.441
so you can hit this on the video and grab yours.

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:35.161
Now, if you're a homeschooling mom

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:37.381
or you just starting out Christmas presents early,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.920
check out this super fun store

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:40.683
and all the cool tubs and rocks they have.
