00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.000
the reason people are upset with the Resilient Jenkins videos

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.480
if you haven't seen it it is a mom of six

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:08.880
about to be seven showing the sleeping conditions of her children

00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:12.800
where all six kids are sharing sleeping areas in the living room and kitchen

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:15.940
while the mom and dad get the bedroom

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.960
now I have never been in a place of poverty

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:21.120
I've never been in a place that I can speak to living in conditions like this

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:25.280
but one thing that I am seeing the most of is mothers being upset

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:29.400
because why are you in the bedroom with no kids sleeping with you

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:31.360
when all your kids are in the living room

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:34.080
if you're in a struggling situation and you have children

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:36.800
your children's needs have to come above yours

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:39.640
so the only issue I see is not that they're living in a one bedroom

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.400
is not the fact that they have a lot of kids

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:44.080
it's how they have allocated their sleeping arrangements

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:46.520
and their resources for those six kids

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.680
so although we don't wanna come from a place of judgement

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.760
of judging parents who are trying their best

00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:53.240
I think everybody who does have kids

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:54.800
is getting a giant red flag

00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:58.280
about how they've allocated the resources that they do have

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.420
in prioritizing the comfort of themselves over their children

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.760
especially when you look at the safety risks

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.000
of having kids adjacent to a kitchen area

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.280
with sharp objects especially young kids

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:09.480
for talking under five

00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:12.320
as well as the open access to the outside

00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:15.800
which is the front door parents ultimately have to take the back seat

00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:19.940
when it comes to health and safety of their children it just is
