00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.625
I just finished cleaning my house 

00:00:01.626 --> 00:00:03.080
and I'd like it to stay that way

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:04.956
so I figured the best course of action 

00:00:04.957 --> 00:00:06.640
was to completely evacuate the city

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:08.200
and go mess up somebody else's

00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:10.920
the ferry ride turned into a free whale watching expedition

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.720
and I've never seen dolphins in this harbour

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.298
so my inner child was squealing 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:15.680
alongside my actual children

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:16.960
we're heading to waiheke Island

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:18.120
which if you don't already know

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:21.321
is a small rock of the coast of Auckland here in Aotearoa, New Zealand 

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:23.080
and I'm lucky because my mum lives here

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:24.360
so it's close enough to visit

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.400
but also there's an ocean between us

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.498
Just the way I like it 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.028
the foot gag is unfortunately in my DNA 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.120
and I was pleased I let

00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:31.800
my 5 year old convinced me she could pack 

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:33.080
her own essentials for the trip 

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:34.560
I wanna eat my dinner in peace later

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:36.200
so we burnt off some energy at the beach

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:36.720
it turns out

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.840
even if you spend your entire life teaching your children not to throw sand

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:40.960
they will, in fact, throw sand

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:42.366
we should have named Goldie Ken

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:44.000
 because she thinks her job is beach

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:45.400
and she takes it very seriously

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:46.280
at this point I realised

00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:49.240
I possibly could have thought through my pre-dinner beach plan a little better

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:50.880
cause by the time the youngins were tired out

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:52.560
they were also wet sandy and starving

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:54.120
and then Goldie just chewed through her lead

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.934
so I was good and ready for that g&t
