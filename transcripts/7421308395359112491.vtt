00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.320
When we moved out of the RV and into our house,

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:04.801
there was one thing that was on my must buy list

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:06.721
and it was fridge storage containers.

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:10.521
Because my kids go through fruit like it is their full time job,

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:13.041
and I like to keep it cut and washed

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:14.721
and ready for them to go at any time.

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:17.681
And this is a lifesaver. This is a five piece set,

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:18.921
five different sizes.

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:22.601
I really like this because it has the internal colander

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.201
that you can wash and dry your fruit

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:25.361
and then stick it right in there.

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:28.021
Keeps it off the ground so it doesn't get moldy.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.160
And it has a lid so it's super easy.

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:36.421
They are air tight dishwasher and microwave safe.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.840
But look at that. My kids can carry it around outside if they want to.

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:43.993
To have a picnic outside. It is so good.
