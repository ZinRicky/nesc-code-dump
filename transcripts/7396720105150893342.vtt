00:00.800 --> 00:02.440
When we started to farm,

00:02.441 --> 00:06.261
I was swept up in the beauty of learning to make food from scratch.

00:06.920 --> 00:10.980
It makes sense why I soon fell in love with idea of a family milk cow.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.760
I was making my own butter, cheese,

00:13.761 --> 00:15.261
ice cream, and yogurt.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.840
As I began to explore this world,

00:17.841 --> 00:21.681
to cook and invent, I needed a way to share these products

00:21.682 --> 00:23.621
with more than just friends and family.

00:23.880 --> 00:27.160
I needed a dairy. So two years of planning,

00:27.161 --> 00:29.541
and then an additional two years of construction,

00:29.800 --> 00:32.600
and we finally did it. And soon,

00:32.601 --> 00:35.061
we'll be sharing these products with all of you.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.840
So for date night tonight,

00:36.841 --> 00:38.721
Daniel and I snuck over to the dairy.

00:38.722 --> 00:40.441
The temperature was perfect.

00:40.442 --> 00:42.301
Little floor Joe was giggling,

00:42.360 --> 00:44.340
and the cows were gorgeous.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.380
It's the world we created,

00:46.480 --> 00:48.300
and I couldn't love it more.
