It's my husband's birthday in a couple days,

00:01.601 --> 00:03.081
and I always have the hardest time

00:03.082 --> 00:04.901
trying to figure out what to get the man

00:04.920 --> 00:05.680
for his birthday.

00:05.681 --> 00:07.561
I wanted to do something a little bit different this year,

00:07.562 --> 00:10.581
and I've been hearing a lot of good things about the website moonpick.

00:10.640 --> 00:14.760
So me and the boys decided to make our own custom cards for dad,

00:14.761 --> 00:16.041
and they came in the mail today.

00:16.042 --> 00:17.281
I did it all on my phone,

00:17.282 --> 00:19.481
and they had a bunch of templates you could choose from,

00:19.482 --> 00:21.561
and then you can customize it however you want.

00:21.562 --> 00:23.361
There's, like, a million different ways you can do it.

00:23.362 --> 00:26.841
So this is the one that I made to be sweet.

00:26.842 --> 00:28.201
It has all our pictures.

00:28.202 --> 00:28.761
These were, like,

00:28.762 --> 00:32.641
my favorite moments from the entire time that I've known him.

00:32.642 --> 00:34.601
And this card is from my kids.

00:34.602 --> 00:35.681
They picked out the colors,

00:35.682 --> 00:37.241
they picked out the design and everything,

00:37.242 --> 00:38.121
and they had a lot of fun,

00:38.122 --> 00:40.001
and they're gonna be so excited to give it to their dad.

00:40.002 --> 00:42.541
Like I said, we literally made these cards

00:42.600 --> 00:44.440
on my phone while we were sitting on the couch,

00:44.441 --> 00:46.201
and they got shipped out right away.

00:46.202 --> 00:49.714
So easy. They're super affordable and great quality.
