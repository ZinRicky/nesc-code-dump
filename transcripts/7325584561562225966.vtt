00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.040
Idaho Senator Chuck Winder

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:06.180
suggests that abortion is to blame for Idaho's work shortages

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.800
we complain about

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:07.601
we don't have service workers

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:08.561
we don't have enough of this

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:09.941
we don't have enough people to do this

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.520
well I think there's a reason not

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:12.661
it's not just low birth rate

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.440
but it is the number of abortions that have occurred

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:17.721
before diving into how absurd of a statement that is

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:22.521
let's be clear that even if abortions were causing a worker shortage

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.761
women do not owe anyone

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.761
including their government

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:29.301
their bodies or reproductive labor

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.040
forced birth is not a policy solution to Idaho's problems

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:34.441
which I'll get to in a second

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:38.361
Idaho's abortion rate has been quite low in stagnant since the early 2000s

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:42.121
with about 1000 to 1500 abortions being performed each year

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:43.201
and just last week

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:45.661
the US Chamber of Commerce released new data

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.280
Idaho has about 55,000 job openings and about 28,000 unemployed individuals

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:54.041
so obviously the math isn't mathing

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:55.921
but even if it was

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:59.481
his statement has a bunch of just incorrect logical fallacies

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:03.641
he's assuming that if we forced all of these women to have given birth

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:06.521
that they all would have resulted in a healthy pregnancy

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:08.801
a healthy baby that would turn into a healthy adult

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:12.021
that would choose to stay and work in Idaho

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.960
and he makes one of the most common Republican logical fallacies

00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.921
which is that if we just forced all of these women

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:20.321
who have historically had abortions

00:01:20.322 --> 00:01:21.841
to have given birth

00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:25.381
that we would have a net increase in population

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.600
no research shows that

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:28.641
let's say we have two women

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:29.801
we have Sam and Sarah

00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:31.481
and they both want an abortion

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:33.361
Sam is denied an abortion

00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:35.821
but Sarah receives the wanted abortion

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.960
Sam is much less likely to have planned

00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:41.401
planned pregnancies later on in her life

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:42.281
versus Sarah

00:01:42.282 --> 00:01:45.761
who is much more likely to have planned pregnancies later on in her life

00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:47.801
so Sam may end up having one child

00:01:47.802 --> 00:01:49.481
while despite having the abortion

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:51.021
Sarah ends up having three

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.380
to the extent that Idaho is experiencing a lower than typical birth rate

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.020
let's just appreciate how dangerous it is to be pregnant in Idaho

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.000
from 2019 to 2021

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.721
the maternal mortality rate in Idaho rose 121%

00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:06.041
while the child an infant

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.461
mortality rate rose 18%

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.800
then Idaho Republicans enacted one of the country's strictest abortion bans

00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.681
and being aware of research that shows that

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:16.601
that will increase maternal mortality

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:17.681
guess what they did

00:02:17.682 --> 00:02:22.421
they dissolved the committee who is tasked with investigating maternal mortality

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.520
maternal services like prenatal care and Obgyns

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:28.081
are becoming much and much more scarce in the state

00:02:28.082 --> 00:02:30.521
as Obgyns and other doctors flee

00:02:30.522 --> 00:02:32.341
because of the strict abortion ban

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.480
one in five Idaho moms do not receive any prenatal care in the first trimester

00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:38.921
and that number is even lower for women of color

00:02:38.922 --> 00:02:41.561
and three in 10 Idaho moms

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:44.201
did not have health insurance before becoming pregnant

00:02:44.202 --> 00:02:49.021
2023 Idaho Republicans rejected $6 million in free

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.400
federal funding to support child care and early childhood development

00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:54.561
because they

00:02:54.562 --> 00:02:55.601
and this is a quote

00:02:55.602 --> 00:02:59.461
didn't wanna make it more convenient for mothers to leave the home

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.440
it infuriates me that these men are in power

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:04.001
men who don't understand us

00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:05.241
see us value us

00:03:05.242 --> 00:03:06.501
or our lives

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.760
who feel entitled to our bodies and reproductive organs and decisions

00:03:10.761 --> 00:03:15.281
who blame us for the consequences of their bad policy making

00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:18.121
it's a level of entitlement and cruelty

00:03:18.122 --> 00:03:19.601
and willful ignorance

00:03:19.602 --> 00:03:22.901
that I don't know that I will ever be able to understand

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.120
I'm the feminist lawyer

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:25.901
follow me if you enjoy being miserable
