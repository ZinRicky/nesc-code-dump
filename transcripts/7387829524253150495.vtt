00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Frederick Douglass is my great, great,

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:02.761
great, great,

00:00:02.762 --> 00:00:04.841
great, great granddaughter of Frederick Douglass.

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:06.321
I am the great, great,

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:07.801
great, great grandchild.

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:10.421
I've been counting on my fingers since I was, like, five.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.740
Whenever you're ready. Here we go.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.700
This is the fourth of July.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.460
It is the birthday of your national independence

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.220
and of your political freedom.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.920
Fellow citizens, I shall not presume to dwell at length

00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:28.181
on the associations that cluster about this day.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.280
The simple story of it is that 76 years ago,

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:35.341
the people of this country were British subjects.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.540
Oppression makes a wise man mad.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.080
Your father's were wise men.

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:40.281
And if they did not go mad,

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:42.221
they became restive under this treatment.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.940
With brave men, there's always a remedy for oppression.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.020
They succeeded. And today you reap the fruits of their success.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.440
The freedom gained is yours,

00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:59.061
and you therefore may properly celebrate this anniversary.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.300
Fellow citizens, pardon me.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.140
Allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.100
What have I, or those I represent to do with your national independence?

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.000
Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.021
embodied in that declaration of independence extended to us?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.060
I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.200
Your high independence only reveals

00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:30.101
the immeasurable distance between us.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.740
The blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in common.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.400
The rich inheritance of justice,

00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:41.341
liberty, prosperity and independence

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.720
bequeathed by your fathers is shared By you,

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:48.161
not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you

00:01:48.162 --> 00:01:50.181
has brought stripes and death to me.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.360
This fourth of July is yours,

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:56.141
not mine. You may rejoice. I must mourn,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.620
fellow citizens

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.240
above your national tumultuous joy.

00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:07.061
I hear the mournful whale of millions

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.400
at a time like this. Scorching irony.

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:12.541
Not convincing argument is needed.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.000
Oh, had I the ability and could reach the nation's ear,

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:23.541
I would today pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.500
blasting reproach, withering sarcasm and stern rebuke.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.280
For it is not light that is needed,

00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:32.721
but fire. It is not the gentle shower,

00:02:32.722 --> 00:02:35.081
the thunder. We need the storm,

00:02:35.082 --> 00:02:37.701
the whirlwind and the earthquake.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.620
The feeling of the nation must be quickened.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.120
The conscience of the nation must be roused.

00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:46.461
The propriety of the nation must be startled.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.960
The hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed,

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:54.181
and its crimes against god and man must be proclaimed and denounced.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.500
What to the American slave is your fourth of July?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.080
I answer, a day that reveals to him,

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:05.921
more than all other days in the year,

00:03:05.922 --> 00:03:11.941
the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.740
To him, your Celebration is a sham.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.060
Your boasted liberty and unholy license,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.840
your national greatness, swelling vanity.

00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:23.241
Your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless.

00:03:23.242 --> 00:03:25.061
Your denunciations of tyrants,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.780
brass fronted impudence.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.340
Your shouts of liberty and Equality hollow mockery.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.640
Your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings

00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:39.881
with all Your religious parade and solemnity are to him mere bombast,

00:03:39.882 --> 00:03:41.221
fraud, deception,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.700
impirity, and hypocrisy.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.080
There is not a nation on the earth

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.941
guilty of practices more shocking and bloody

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.540
than are the people of these United States at this very hour.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.420
Allow me to say in conclusion,

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.280
not withstanding the dark picture I have this day presented

00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:07.841
of the state of the nation,

00:04:07.842 --> 00:04:10.381
I do not despair of this country.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.580
Um,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.280
the speech was written almost 170 years ago,

00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.721
but there, I mean,

00:04:25.722 --> 00:04:27.521
this part of it is still extremely relevant,

00:04:27.522 --> 00:04:29.141
especially with today's protest.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.560
I think that when people are oppressed,

00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:34.561
they feel silenced, and if someone feels silenced,

00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:37.321
they get angry. There are certain tactics that you need to use

00:04:37.322 --> 00:04:39.601
to get people to really hear your voice,

00:04:39.602 --> 00:04:42.001
and it's not always gonna be just like,

00:04:42.002 --> 00:04:43.701
a very calm discussion.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.480
I think he's mostly talking to the people who are already on his side,

00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:49.361
but believes that, um,

00:04:49.362 --> 00:04:51.921
they can still try to talk this out

00:04:51.922 --> 00:04:54.121
or that things are still justifiable.

00:04:54.122 --> 00:04:56.241
I know a lot of people at the time were saying,

00:04:56.242 --> 00:04:57.801
and people now are still saying,

00:04:57.802 --> 00:05:00.301
that it's not as bad as it could be.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.120
While the fourth of July probably does not feel the same to me

00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:06.641
as it does to others, I wouldn't say that it has no meeting,

00:05:06.642 --> 00:05:08.841
because it's is the time when America

00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:11.341
as a country became free from another country.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.420
Um, but I would say that it's not the Time in which I gained my freedom.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.000
He had a lot of hope, especially for his age.

00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:23.761
And, like,

00:05:23.762 --> 00:05:26.961
I'm getting to the point in my life where I'm only 20 years old,

00:05:26.962 --> 00:05:29.021
but I'm exhausted. Like, I'm.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.740
I have these thoughts, like,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.640
will we ever really get to this point?

00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:37.421
Or is this really something that we should actually

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.740
spend our time fighting for?

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.020
Somebody once said that pessimism is a tool of white oppression,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.640
and I think that's true. I think in many ways,

00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:49.441
we are still, um,

00:05:49.442 --> 00:05:56.261
slaves to the notion that it will never get better.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.380
But I think that there is hope,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.760
um,

00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:04.241
and I think it's important that we celebrate black joy and black life.

00:06:04.242 --> 00:06:07.861
And we remember that change is possible,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.940
change is probable,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.980
um, and that there's hope.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.620
Haha.
