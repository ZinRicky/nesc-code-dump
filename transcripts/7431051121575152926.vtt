00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
If you don't wanna be called Nazis,

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.160
stop doing. You're called an anti Semite more than a hostess table.

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:07.681
Yeah, and people will sit there and.

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:08.481
No, by me,

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:09.761
I never called you an anti Semite.

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:12.081
I mean, I'm not sitting here saying I'm a supporter of the Palestinians.

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:12.921
I'm used to it. Yeah,

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:14.441
well, I hope your Bieber doesn't go off.

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:16.761
The thing is, is that you just say I should die.

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:17.961
You should not. No.

00:00:17.962 --> 00:00:18.961
Did you just say I should be killed?

00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:20.041
No, I did not say that.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:20.761
No, I did not say that.

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:24.141
Hold on. Did you just say I should be killed on live TV?

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.920
Guys, let me.

00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:26.701
Let me just stop. You said you heard my beep.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.000
Of the Palestinian Hamas. Guys,

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.841
I said Palestinian. Are you.

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:33.881
I said, am I what?

00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:36.141
Now? Tell Ryan that I apologize.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.080
Ryan, that I apologize.

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.461
That I apologize. That I apologize.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.480
Ryan. Ryan,

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:41.101
that is completely. That is completely.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.240
That is completely.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.761
Let's have first block say the Muslim guy should be blown up.

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:46.601
I apologize on TV. Don't say.

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:48.081
Don't say. Then I apologize.

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:50.161
You literally. I thought you said Hamas.

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:51.601
I apologize. You didn't think I said Hamas?

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:53.241
I said I supported Palestinian rights.

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:54.041
Yes, I did.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.840
What's funny is Rudy Giuliani said this yesterday.

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:59.441
So you're a great guest to be here to defend Rudy Giuliani.

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:01.121
Give me one sec. Give me.

00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:03.241
Give me one sec. And so at this point,

00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:04.041
this is what We're in now.

00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:05.661
This is America in 2024.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.800
Forget the racism which I should die.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.001
I didn't say that. You said,

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.181
what is Bieber mean? Don't give me your face.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.320
Why did you say, with my Bieber?

00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:16.541
What did you mean by the Bieber?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.380
I said, what did you mean by the Bieber?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.040
No, you didn't.

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:21.321
You said, I hope your Bieber doesn't go off.

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:26.021
At least have the guts to support your racist brother.
