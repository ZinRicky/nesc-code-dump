00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.000
today was so good

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.360
I didn't realise how much it being out of our routine was affecting us

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:04.800
until today when we got back into it

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.720
we were all happy and had more patience with each other

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.040
and our day just felt really productive

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.600
the kids jumped right back into lessons as if we haven't taken a four week break

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:12.400
I was actually really impressed with how much they retained

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.120
I was expecting need to do a few weeks of review

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:15.680
but they are ready to move full speed ahead

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.680
I don't know if it's because we supplemented with learning apps

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:20.000
the last couple of weeks or they're getting older and ready to move faster

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.120
either way they haven't skipped

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.680
in fact I actually think we can skip a few lessons and get back on track

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.720
not that my goal is to finish the curriculum by the end of the year

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:27.240
but I think they're ready for a little bit of a challenge

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:29.760
so I think I'm gonna spend less time reviewing and more just moving ahead

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:32.080
the beauty of homeschooling is I can slow down and speed up as I need to

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:32.480
and right now

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.360
I think all of the unschooling we've done the last couple of weeks

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:35.646
have put them a little bit further ahead
