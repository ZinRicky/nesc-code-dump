00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.080
my kids have pulled a Freaky Friday move on

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:04.320
my daughter used to be defiant and give me a hard time during lessons

00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:05.520
and my son used to be an angel

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:06.760
and now they have flip flop

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:09.800
don't get me wrong I'm glad I'm not battling them both at the same time

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:12.040
but what is going on for the last few days

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:14.360
my son has just been complaining that everything is just too hard

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:16.360
he's too tired and he doesn't wanna do anything

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:19.480
I'm trying to show him a little Grace because he is younger doing harder work

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:21.520
but we've gotta work on that perseverance in that grade

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.080
cause we're not gonna give up and not do something just because it's hard

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:25.840
and quite honestly it's not even really that hard for him

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:26.680
he just doesn't wanna try

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:27.440
last year in kindergarten

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:28.920
everything was just so easy for him

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.280
so this is a little bit more challenging

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:32.400
yeah I know you're gonna ask what do you do in moments like that

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:33.440
first I always give him a break

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:35.560
because learning is not gonna happen when he shut down like that

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:36.480
if the weather is reasonable

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:38.680
we usually go outside because outside fixes everything

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:40.040
or I give him a snack and some time alone

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:40.640
when he's calm down

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.120
we talk about why he responded that way and what we could do differently

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.680
so we're always gonna come back to that activity either today or tomorrow

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:46.520
but it's going to get done

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.254
because we don't quit just because it's hard
