00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.800
I don't think you should ever have to apologize

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.440
for your excitement

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.780
just because it's like,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.680
I don't know,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.880
just because something's cliche

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.800
doesn't mean that it's not something that's awesome.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.920
The worst kind of person

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.080
is someone who makes someone feel bad,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.400
dumb or stupid for, like,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.728
being excited about something.
