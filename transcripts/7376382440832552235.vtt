00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
My husband's birthday is coming up,

00:01.721 --> 00:05.161
so I decided to surprise him by cooking him an Italian

00:05.162 --> 00:06.641
inspired dinner tonight.

00:06.642 --> 00:08.961
Started by making some mozzarella cheese

00:08.962 --> 00:11.501
for my tomato and mozzarella salad.

00:11.560 --> 00:14.720
Combine some milk with citric acid and some run it

00:14.721 --> 00:17.881
before slicing it up and returning it back to the heat.

00:17.882 --> 00:20.461
Once all the way separates from the curds,

00:20.560 --> 00:23.400
spoon them into my cheese cloth and let them drain

00:23.401 --> 00:27.721
before returning them to some hot water and shaping my mozzarella.

00:27.722 --> 00:28.881
Once that was done,

00:28.882 --> 00:31.961
I moved on to deflating my focaccia dough

00:31.962 --> 00:34.541
that had been rising for about four hours.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.000
I turned it out and let that rise for another hour

00:37.001 --> 00:39.261
while I got started on my pasta dough.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.640
This was very simple.

00:40.641 --> 00:41.961
It was just some flour,

00:41.962 --> 00:43.561
eggs, olive oil, and salt.

00:43.562 --> 00:45.441
I needed that until it was smooth

00:45.442 --> 00:47.521
and then wrapped it up in plastic wrap.

00:47.522 --> 00:51.281
One night I threw together this random fennel and leak pasta,

00:51.282 --> 00:54.841
and ever since then, my husband has been asking me to make it again.

00:54.842 --> 00:58.881
So today was the day I finally sliced up some leak and fennel.

00:58.882 --> 01:01.081
For setting that aside this point,

01:01.082 --> 01:04.241
my focaccia dough was ready to get dimpled and popped in the oven.

01:04.242 --> 01:07.881
So I opted to make a cumin seed and lemon focaccia.

01:07.882 --> 01:11.921
I put that in the oven and then got started on shaping my pasta.

01:11.922 --> 01:14.481
We went for a simple fettuccine shape today,

01:14.482 --> 01:18.161
and I put all of my pasta on my drying Rack to dry

01:18.162 --> 01:20.381
before I prepped my salad.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.040
I used some heirloom tomatoes,

01:22.041 --> 01:23.601
the mozzarella I made earlier,

01:23.602 --> 01:24.881
a drizzle of olive oil,

01:24.882 --> 01:26.461
salt, pepper, and basil.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.080
I sliced up my focaccia

01:28.081 --> 01:31.941
and plated that before I moved on to finishing my pasta.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.880
Sauteed my leek and fennel with some garlic and a splash of white wine

01:35.881 --> 01:40.361
before adding my pasta into my sauce and slowly ladling that pasta

01:40.362 --> 01:43.321
water and Parmesan cheese in to make a sauce

01:43.322 --> 01:45.001
before plating it all up

01:45.002 --> 01:47.649
and finishing it with some Parmesan cheese on top.
