00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.740
When's the last time you went to the dentist?

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.760
Don't you lie to me.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.160
Be honest. Be honest.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.860
Cause if you're not gonna go to the dentist,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.480
you should at least get a toothbrush

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.040
that's doing a little bit more than a manual toothbrush.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.600
I go to the dentist and they still recommend that I use,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.880
like, a Sonic toothbrush.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.720
And I got this one from the TikTok shop.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.740
Like, right here.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.360
Five brushing modes.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.160
Look,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.880
it has, like, polish clean for sensitivity.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.240
The brush legit is really soft.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.560
That's one thing I'm not gonna fuck with.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.220
I am not gonna fuck with my actual gums.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.100
No, I'm not.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.040
It's, like, really tiny and small,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.220
so it really feels safe.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.200
And it has a two minute timer, so.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.360
And it does. For 30 seconds.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.100
You can brush, like, one quadrant for 30 seconds,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.920
the other quadrant for 30 seconds.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.360
And, like, be super confident that you're brushing your teeth well

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.500
and with a good toothbrush.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.116
It's like, right here.
