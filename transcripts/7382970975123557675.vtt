00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
I have a teenage daughter,

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:03.901
and I feel like the younger generations

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.540
really just have life figured out.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.320
Anytime she does something,

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.981
she makes me laugh.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.320
She will talk about herself as if she'll.

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:16.681
She'll kind of start saying what the crowd would be saying

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:17.641
if she was on stage.

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:18.461
So, like,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.600
she washes the dish and she's like,

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:21.761
she did that great.

00:00:21.762 --> 00:00:26.081
She. She will speak about herself as if there was an audience there

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:27.561
and that's what they're saying.

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:29.801
And now I've kinda gotten in the habit of that.

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:31.301
So anything I do,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.340
I then say kind of like,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.920
she looks amazing today.

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:35.841
Like, that's what,

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:37.781
you know, the people would be saying if they saw me.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.000
And it has been quite a mind fuck and really just makes me laugh.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.301
Like, I constantly have people, like,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.560
cheering me on and saying,

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.301
dope shit, but it's me.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.720
But your brain is tricky that way,

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:51.001
so you should try that.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:51.761
Just, you know,

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:53.561
cheer yourself on all day long.

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:55.421
She did that. She looks amazing.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.800
She killed it.

00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:58.661
Her hair. Killing it.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.260
Just speak about yourself amazingly and you'll start to fall for it.
