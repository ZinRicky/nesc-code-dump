00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.740
My brain was too big for my skull.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.060
And it was crushing into my spine.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.720
And then all of my brain fluid

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.460
was flowing into my spine.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.560
And then my spine was kind of,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.780
like, expanding from all of the fluid.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.200
So what they were going to do is

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.380
they went into the back of my skull.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.900
And they removed two inches of my skull

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.200
and my first vertebrae.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.800
So I have a nice big hole in the back of my head.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.320
My neurosurgeon came in

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.400
and she talked to us,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.920
and she said

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.280
that if we would have waited even two more weeks,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.000
then I would have been completely paralyzed

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.220
from the neck down.
