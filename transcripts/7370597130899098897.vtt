00:00:00.321 --> 00:00:02.960
I think we all know what's gonna happen in the next four seasons of Bridgerton

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.900
even though we've been left on this huge cliffhanger

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.440
Penelope has had a massive glow up

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.240
Lord Debbling has come to town

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:12.180
he is this avid explorer man

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.720
pretty sure he's headed off to go to Australia

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:18.100
because they said that it's gonna take a year to where he's gotta go to next

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.680
and so yeah he's obsessed

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:21.520
maybe he's a botanist or something like that

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.200
I don't know I might have missed it

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:24.520
I wasn't paying that much attention

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:27.040
but anyway he is gonna like go away

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:30.080
travel the world come back every like three or four years or something like that

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:31.480
he's amazing he's great

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:33.620
he's hot he's rich

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.600
he's you know successful

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.460
he's the catch

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.120
she manages to attract the catch of the season

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:46.640
therefore making her eligible in the eyes of the rest of the time society

00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:48.040
Mayfair just the way in high school

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:51.240
I had a huge glow up and managed to pull the catch of the year level

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:57.580
and that redeemed my hmm shake your reputation as an opinionated

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.480
smart little rebel because I had the approval

00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:04.560
um of

00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:08.080
you know a guy that was popular that everyone loved

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:14.700
there's no what better way for a woman to achieve validation than through a man

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.920
it's patriarchy but I digress

00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:19.220
she secures him and everyone's like wow

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.800
she must actually be really cool

00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:22.360
she must actually be a babe

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:25.540
we haven't even really noticed that is crazy

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.120
um and then of course the guy that she actually likes

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:33.180
like the guy next door is like oh oh

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.960
ah I see you and then he decides to go for it and then he does and you know

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:42.320
we've all been happy in a carriage

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:46.120
whatever flips the old digit in loves the moment of the mid of consent

00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:48.080
thought that was really great props to that

00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:50.540
even smut needs consent folks!!

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.560
and now we've gotta wait another month to figure out what happens

00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.960
except we already know what's gonna happen because she's got a secret

00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:59.300
Penelope's got a secret Penelope is xoxo Gossip Girl

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.480
guy next door said when he finds out who xoxo Gossip Girl is

00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:05.720
he's gonna kill xoxo Gossip Girl but he's marrying xoxo Gossip Girl

00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:08.120
it's a classic ðŸ¦† marry kill scenario

00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:11.040
and then he's gonna get really angry and then she's gonna be like

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:11.880
oh my God

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:15.040
and then it's all gonna come out and then somehow they're gonna end up together

00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:15.840
anyway

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.000
boring I would like to propose an alternative ending

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.640
I would like to propose that the happy ending for her

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.520
and I really this not off the cards

00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:30.120
but this is what I wanna happen is that she does marry Lord DEBLING LOL I FORGOT HIS NAME 

00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:33.100
heads off to Australia to colonise us

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.360
while he's off colonising the shit out of a country

00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:42.100
that very much has native title and sovereignty

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.780
which was never seeded

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.520
Penelope gets to live her best life funded by colonisation

00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:51.800
because you know what dismantle

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:57.080
infiltrate and these women are not in a position to dismantle

00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:59.920
they have no power they have to

00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:01.560
they are at the whims of the man

00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:03.280
so if you're gonna be at the whims of a man

00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:06.920
you might as well be at the whims of a man who is very far away

00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:09.200
and then she gets left alone for three to four years

00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:11.160
probably longer to be honest

00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:13.840
he might even get killed while he's over in Australia

00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:15.460
and then she'll just inherit his estate

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.780
get to fill his library with nice books

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.880
get to do her personal projects

00:03:19.881 --> 00:03:21.320
get to socialise with her friends

00:03:21.321 --> 00:03:23.620
get to write her little xoxo Gossip Girl columns

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.440
get to buy pretty dresses and keep glowing up as she has been

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:32.720
get to live her life and I hope that the final scene is her writing

00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:33.840
sitting on a windowsill

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:37.040
doing whatever the hell she wants to do with the rest of her life

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:42.740
because I cannot stand if it's another series about how love is the answer

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.180
because you know what for some women

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.620
being alone in a room a room of one's own is the answer

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.760
and I would love to see it

00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:53.460
what do you think what do you wanna happen
