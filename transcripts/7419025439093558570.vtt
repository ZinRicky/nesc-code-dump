00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
We are currently getting the outer bands of Hurricane Helene right now,

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:06.341
and because of that, our property was hit by a tornado this morning.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.160
And when situations like this happen,

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.921
I always try to find the god moments

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:12.881
because there's so much bad that we could dwell on,

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.641
but I try to find, okay,

00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:16.621
what good came out of the situation.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.520
So our property is a family compound.

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:21.201
Currently, my in laws live there and our construction offices there,

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:24.881
and we have been trying to build our house there since January,

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:26.801
but we've had so many issues with permitting

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:27.981
and fighting with the county,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.120
so we've kind of put it on pause,

00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:33.021
bought a different house while we fight the process.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.340
Well, we have not understood why,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.920
with everything that we have done,

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:40.161
it just wasn't working. Like, Lord,

00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:42.161
what are you doing? What are you trying to show us?

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.041
Why are you pausing these plans?

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:45.581
Like, it just doesn't make sense.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.600
Well, today,

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:48.561
the path that the tornado took

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:51.561
would have gone right through the middle of our house.

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:54.281
So had we been able to start on our plans,

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:55.561
and in our timing,

00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:57.881
we either would have been towards the end of construction,

00:00:57.882 --> 00:00:59.281
or we would have just moved in.

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:02.941
So either we would have been out hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.040
and had to restart our house,

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:08.161
or we would have been living in it and had catastrophic damage to us

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:10.761
personally. So even though it sucks,

00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:12.881
And it's a bad situation, trying to find the good.

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:14.841
And can definitely see, like,

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:17.195
the god moment and his Protection in that moment for us.
