00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
What a lot of tribes don't realize is your husband is weird,

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:05.521
and people can pick up on that.

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:10.181
So I read an article that Hannah Neilman is super pissed about

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.400
the original article written about her,

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.521
because she's so annoyed at the backlash,

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:17.361
and it was, you know,

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:20.461
a plot against her and her family and blah, blah, blah.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.380
And I feel like,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.320
especially since I am kind of like the voice of the anti Chad wife,

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:33.541
I wanna explain why. Why that happened in the first place.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.240
She specifically says that she feels like it was an attack against her,

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:39.061
her family, and her husband.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.840
And then she has to, like,

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:41.281
defend that, like,

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:42.561
this is the life that they choose,

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:44.561
they co do everything, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:46.281
Because just using her words,

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:47.601
her life, and her experience,

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:51.201
we can understand what the fuck is going on.

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:54.941
It doesn't take a fucking genius to see what's going on.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.500
She says she rejected him for six months,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.760
and he. And he wouldn't listen.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.641
He said the first moment he saw her,

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:03.361
he was like, check.

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:04.681
Ready to go. Let's go.

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:05.841
Sign her up. Lock it in.

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:08.681
I'm ready to go. So she was a trophy in his eyes.

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:11.901
From the beginning, he was relentless.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.640
And in pursuing her, he stopped her.

00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:19.401
To the point of, you know,

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:22.201
using his connections to get next to her on a flight

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:23.601
to act like it's kiss Matt.

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:27.941
Like all them fucking Chump that text their girlfriend at 11:11

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.200
trying to act like, oh my god,

00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:30.841
I don't even know what that's about,

00:01:30.842 --> 00:01:36.281
you know what I mean? Like that's fucking creeper status. Okay?

00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:39.401
It's not that they had to judge your life in any kind of way.

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:40.721
It was clear to see just from the.

00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:43.201
The fucking facts that exist.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:48.441
Other huge piece to this is the fact that she says, oh,

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:51.641
I feel old and tired. And he's telling her,

00:01:51.642 --> 00:01:52.561
well, we wanna fill.

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:53.981
Fill that 15 seater.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.680
You can hear the coercive control that goes on in the relationship.

00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:02.201
And if you can see it on such a light level

00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:03.761
when we're supposed to be talking about something fun

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:05.981
like your little farm in the cute shit you do,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.260
but you could pick up on his ugly vibes,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.840
that's where the concern is coming from.

00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:12.321
It's like from the actual quote,

00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:14.741
it's not from anything the journalist inferred.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.460
And it's fair for the journalist to kind of put there like,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.880
this was the vibe I was feeling,

00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:22.201
cause a lot of communication is nonverbal.

00:02:22.202 --> 00:02:25.541
You pick up on things. You're seeing the looks and the.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.320
That you can feel the tension in the room.

00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:30.041
Of course you're gonna put that in an article.

00:02:30.042 --> 00:02:33.161
I have a whole podcast episode releasing today.

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:34.481
I'm editing it right now

00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:36.841
where I go into greater detail about everything

00:02:36.842 --> 00:02:39.801
that I find problematic with their relationship.

00:02:39.802 --> 00:02:43.361
Based on facts, not on anything that the Journalist tried to,

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:46.021
you know, infer in place in there on his own.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.800
But what I'm saying is,

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:53.161
you were a young girl when this man swept into your life, just,

00:02:53.162 --> 00:02:54.641
like, barged his way in,

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:56.381
like, a bowl in a China shop,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.200
convinced you with all his magical tricks

00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:01.981
of all this magical, wonderful life you were gonna have.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.400
And it's not exactly what you thought it was gonna be.

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:07.041
You thought you'd get trips to Greece.

00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:09.401
Instead, you get an egg apron.

00:03:09.402 --> 00:03:13.461
We can all see it. It's not the article.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.700
It's just the life.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.884
The podcast will be out later today. Check the channel.
