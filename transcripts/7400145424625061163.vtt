I couldn't make the K18 hair mask at home,

00:02.681 --> 00:06.521
so obviously I had to go get the K18 repair service.

00:06.522 --> 00:09.121
My hair was in desperate need of some love.

00:09.122 --> 00:11.841
I've been using K18 for a couple years now.

00:11.842 --> 00:14.681
Ever since I started straightening my hair a bunch,

00:14.682 --> 00:16.401
it was time for the treatment.

00:16.402 --> 00:20.721
My stylist started off with promised and got it all through my hair.

00:20.722 --> 00:24.441
She made sure to detangle it and then moved on to the leave in mask.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.681
She used about one to two pumps.

00:26.682 --> 00:28.561
She started blowing out my hair.

00:28.562 --> 00:32.401
We worked in sections to make sure that everything was really smooth.

00:32.402 --> 00:36.461
I love how shiny my hair is even after just the blow dry.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.760
She went in with the K18 oil,

00:38.761 --> 00:41.361
only used one drop, worked it through my hair,

00:41.362 --> 00:43.321
and then straightened my hair.

00:43.322 --> 00:47.415
I love how healthy and shiny my hair looks every time I use K18.
