00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.360
After my last post, I got a couple new followers

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:04.221
so I wanted to introduce myself.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.040
Um, my name is Lisa.

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:08.641
I am a 37 year old mom of 3.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.561
I'm a stay at home mom. I homeschool my older 2 kids.

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:13.581
I have a 9 8 and two and a/2 year old.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.040
I also have a degree in socio cultural anthropology

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.861
as well as a background in culinary.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.680
I don't really share cooking on here,

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:23.561
it's just a different type of content.

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:26.541
But I do do a lot of deep dives on social norms,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.480
on cultural phenomenon, on issues pertaining to feminism,

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:34.141
womanhood, parenthood in this country as well.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.160
Um, if you're interested in more of the deep divey topics,

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:40.901
I do have a season of a podcast that you can find in my link tree

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.640
that really goes more in depth

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.521
into a lot of these socio cultural norms,

00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:49.141
including the white beauty standard and the um,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.000
the pedophilic nature of the male gaze,

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.161
which was the conversation that those videos kind of blew up on.

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:56.441
But there's more there too.

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:57.721
So if you're into the deep dives,

00:00:57.722 --> 00:00:59.701
like that's a great place to go as well.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.760
Um, if you are following along,

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.601
I don't just share deep dives,

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:05.441
I definitely share a lot of parenting content,

00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:07.201
a lot of gentle parenting content,

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:10.941
a lot of inner child healing journey stuff,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.180
a lot of homeschooling resources,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.000
a little bit of my day to day life as a stay at home Mom.

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:17.701
A lot of feminist content,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.160
as well as a lot of deconstructing content.

00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:22.581
Um, and then style and fashion,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.480
because we're also kind of a fashion girly.

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:27.681
So you can do all. You can do it all on here, right?

00:01:27.682 --> 00:01:29.201
Women don't have to be just one thing.

00:01:29.202 --> 00:01:31.081
So I, um,

00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:33.201
talk a lot about a. A variety of topics.

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:35.241
You can find some playlists up above.

00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:36.961
And I'm really glad you're here.

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.661
Whatever content brought you here,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.080
I would love to hear in the comments

00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.881
some of the things that you find interesting right now

00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:45.081
and you would like to discuss,

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:47.161
because I love stretching our brains

00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:49.901
and having these difficult and interesting conversations.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.980
But thanks for following along. And that's me least be
