00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
And that's how you know it's literally time to go.

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:03.601
I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding.

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:04.761
I was like, I don't give a.

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:09.241
I don't give a fuck if I expire,

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:13.021
because I am expiring inside

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.380
every moment that I continue this bullshit ass bullshit.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.080
I know that I said I was gonna do my part,

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:21.401
and I know that I said I was gonna, like,

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:22.521
have the kids and be your wife,

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:23.121
but, like,

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.161
it just doesn't feel like I thought it was gonna feel.

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:26.761
This is not what I fucking signed up for.

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:29.501
Like, it gets to a point where it is, like,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.600
choking you with how much you have to choose between, like,

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:36.121
letting everybody else live and have their freedom.

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:36.921
And you just, like,

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:39.641
sit in this tiny prison of your own brain,

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:43.161
of your own making, and you're supposed to be fucking happy.

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:44.941
Like it,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.980
it is I,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.340
I will take being a single mother

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.640
with all the struggles that it comes with,

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:56.721
with all the lonely. Everything,

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.101
everything, like,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.120
everything is still better then being in a miserable marriage

00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:05.801
and feeling so empty and lonely

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:09.441
and used and unappreciated and undervalued.

00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:10.481
And then you start to wonder,

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:12.281
do I fucking matter? Like,

00:01:12.282 --> 00:01:15.081
maybe I am totally fucking useless, as,

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:18.661
like, the fucking mental jumps you have to go on

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.900
to make it right in your head

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.280
is such a fucking weight. And then to have no support,

00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:25.481
no love. Do you know what I Mean,

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:28.841
like that shit when you fucking are feeling like that,

00:01:28.842 --> 00:01:32.450
like it's time to fucking go. And I'm wishing you luck.
