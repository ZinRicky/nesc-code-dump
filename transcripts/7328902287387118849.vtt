00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
I don't feel like leaving the house today,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.420
but unless I have to

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.580
how the fuck am I supposed to get out of this driveway?

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.620
Always hot and it's so hot

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.020
I'm in a bush

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.320
in another bush.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.300
I don't normally park in this driveway and that is why.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.500
Okay, let's go.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.800
One thing about me that you probably should know

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.840
is that I am actually an emo.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.180
My Spotify rep last year told me so

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.080
and I'm not surprised because

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.220
this is the sort of shit that I love to listen to.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.240
I have no idea why,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.060
but the traffic was so heavy

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.040
and I kept having all these intrusive thoughts

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040
like I was gonna get into an accident or something

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.400
but I was fine obviously.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.780
But does that happen to anyone else or just me?

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.820
Okay, help me pick a dress

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.860
option No. 1 option No. 2. I cannot zip up.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.940
This one's quite cute,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.340
but if I lean over

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.200
getting more than you pack it for.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.340
I don't know. I just feel like it's a no immediately. No,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.320
I don't know.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.960
I'm not having very much luck.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.500
It's just bloody a lot of fabric.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.400
I can't I can't do it up.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.840
I can't do anything up by myself.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.220
It's kind of fire though.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.660
Could be quite cute to go like dark theme. Yeah,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.280
the amount of partners

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.760
I've heard coming in to pick dresses up for this

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.280
significant other.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.400
Oh my God, I can't

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.920
I love love Also,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.760
I'm not having fun doing this.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.540
I don't like doing this last one.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.920
I am struggling.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.820
Cute dresser.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.720
My God, I was in that shop for like an hour

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.920
and I wish I was joking.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.060
I think I tried on pretty much every dress,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.660
but I just feel like

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.020
I don't know if I like suits,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.360
anything. Anyway,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.480
we found a dress.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.920
I don't really like shopping.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.360
I don't find it that enjoyable.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.640
I don't like trying things on

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.680
and I just tried on so many things. Anyway,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.800
thank you for hanging out with me.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.600
You made it so much more enjoyable.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.440
I'm gonna go home.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.880
I'm gonna decompress for a little bit

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.400
and then the kids are gonna be home

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.760
not long after I get back.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.240
So I'm gonna leave it here. But, uh,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.660
we'll see you again very soon.
