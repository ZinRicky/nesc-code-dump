Here's everything my German dad eats in a day,

00:02.000 --> 00:03.580
slash what I cook for him.

00:03.640 --> 00:04.880
Cooking is my love language,

00:04.880 --> 00:07.440
so I love cooking for people that I care about.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.440
I thought it would be nice to cook for my dad

00:09.440 --> 00:11.200
while he's out here helping me.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.840
So let's start off with breakfast.

00:12.840 --> 00:16.480
We did an egg scramble with some chives on top,

00:16.480 --> 00:19.000
and then also some heirloom tomato.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.780
This tomato was gorgeous.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.080
And then I also added some feta cheese,

00:23.080 --> 00:24.920
since that's one of his favorite cheeses.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.020
And then I plated it all up with

00:27.040 --> 00:29.840
some of my homemade pickled onions and some rye bread.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.960
My dad likes really simple meals,

00:31.960 --> 00:34.000
and he doesn't wanna eat a lot of meat,

00:34.000 --> 00:35.720
so that's what we're going for today.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.440
I obviously need to have my midday beverage,

00:38.440 --> 00:39.120
you guys know.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.980
So today it was an orange Poppy,

00:41.160 --> 00:43.220
and then I got started on lunch.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.120
For lunch, we kept it really simple

00:45.120 --> 00:46.920
with some roasted asparagus

00:46.920 --> 00:48.520
that I seasoned with some olive oil,

00:48.520 --> 00:49.240
salt, pepper,

00:49.240 --> 00:52.200
garlic. And then I sliced up some garlic,

00:52.200 --> 00:54.000
onions, and cherry tomatoes,

00:54.000 --> 00:55.560
and also some fennel.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.240
Once asparagus was halfway done,

00:57.240 --> 01:01.400
I topped my fish with Calabrian chili and tomato butter

01:01.400 --> 01:03.360
and pop that in the oven to

01:03.360 --> 01:05.380
cook alongside the asparagus.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.960
Sauteed all my tomatoes with the onions in the pan,

01:07.960 --> 01:10.400
and then I topped it all with some herbs

01:10.400 --> 01:11.620
and some olives.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.000
This was so good,

01:13.000 --> 01:14.680
and one of his favorite meals that he's had.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.680
In a while, as an afternoon snack,

01:16.680 --> 01:19.840
I made some banana bread with my whipped robus

01:19.840 --> 01:20.600
honey butter

01:20.600 --> 01:23.200
and then topped it with some raspberry sauce.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.340
I also made.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.280
Ended up having three plates of that.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.840
And then after that

01:27.840 --> 01:29.280
I got started on dinner.

01:29.280 --> 01:33.600
I decided to make some naan bread with a lentil doll.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.840
So I prep my nando

01:35.840 --> 01:38.760
and then made a quick pickled cucumber salad

01:38.760 --> 01:39.660
with some sumak.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.280
Diced up my onions,

01:41.280 --> 01:43.280
added them to the pan with some aromatics

01:43.280 --> 01:44.760
and some tomato,

01:44.760 --> 01:47.600
added all my spices to get them nice and fragrant.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.240
Lentils, some coconut milk

01:49.240 --> 01:51.240
and then I plated that with some turmeric,

01:51.240 --> 01:52.640
rice and raita.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.880
Think that's how you pronounce it.

01:53.880 --> 01:54.880
My pickled onions,

01:54.880 --> 01:57.180
the salad and then my fresh naan bread.
