This has been my favorite late night snack lately.

00:02.801 --> 00:04.481
I know it doesn't look the best,

00:04.482 --> 00:07.321
but it's vanilla pudding with a raspberry sauce,

00:07.322 --> 00:10.601
where you basically just make your vanilla pudding with your eggs, milk,

00:10.602 --> 00:11.881
sugar, the usual,

00:11.882 --> 00:12.521
and then

00:12.522 --> 00:15.481
you make your raspberry sauce by boiling down some raspberries

00:15.482 --> 00:17.681
with some sugar and lemon

00:17.682 --> 00:19.201
and popping that in the fridge.

00:19.202 --> 00:22.601
I like the combination of warm and cold stuff.

00:22.602 --> 00:24.521
So my custard is a little warm still,

00:24.522 --> 00:27.741
and then my raspberry sauce is cold.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.320
There's just something about,

00:29.321 --> 00:31.761
like, the tartness of the raspberries with

00:31.762 --> 00:33.701
the sweetness of the vanilla pudding.

00:35.920 --> 00:36.720
Hmm.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.140
This is so good.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.180
I grew up having vanilla pudding a lot,

00:42.200 --> 00:45.660
so this is so nostalgic to me. Look at that.
