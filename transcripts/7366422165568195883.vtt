00:00.000 --> 00:01.080
This might be a hot take,

00:01.081 --> 00:03.881
but not everything has to include everyone.

00:03.882 --> 00:07.081
Today, the Boy Scouts of America decided to announce their rebrand

00:07.082 --> 00:08.001
and their new name.

00:08.002 --> 00:10.361
They're going to be called Scouting America,

00:10.362 --> 00:11.561
I think is what it's called.

00:11.562 --> 00:12.441
And they did so.

00:12.442 --> 00:14.741
They claim an attempt to be more inclusive.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.000
They've had a lot of issues for a lot of years,

00:17.001 --> 00:19.581
so I'm sure there's a lot of reasons for wanting to rebrand.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.740
But we see this a lot where we see these organizations,

00:22.800 --> 00:26.040
see these things have been around forever,

00:26.041 --> 00:27.041
and they change

00:27.042 --> 00:29.801
because they claim that they're not being inclusive enough.

00:29.802 --> 00:31.241
You see this in Boy Scouting.

00:31.242 --> 00:33.161
You see this with girls and women sport.

00:33.162 --> 00:35.201
Everything needs to include everybody.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.001
The very worst thing you can be is exclusive.

00:37.002 --> 00:38.861
And anything that is exclusive

00:39.080 --> 00:42.360
needs to be dismantled and rebranded and changed.

00:42.361 --> 00:44.321
But what we fail to realize is that everything,

00:44.322 --> 00:46.861
every word, just by having a definition,

00:46.880 --> 00:50.120
is by its nature, excluding everything that is not that thing.

00:50.121 --> 00:52.601
So if you have anything that is for boys,

00:52.602 --> 00:53.801
it is exclusive, right?

00:53.802 --> 00:55.441
Because it's excluding everything that isn't a boy.

00:55.442 --> 00:57.101
If you have anything for women,

00:57.120 --> 01:00.480
it is exclusive because it is excluding everything that is not women.

01:00.481 --> 01:02.401
Boys need spaces for boys,

01:02.402 --> 01:04.081
girls need spaces for girls.

01:04.082 --> 01:05.241
Men need spaces for men,

01:05.242 --> 01:06.881
and women need spaces for women.

01:06.882 --> 01:10.981
Push. And this demand for everything in our society to be inclusive

01:11.000 --> 01:13.540
is actually just watering Down our organizations

01:13.560 --> 01:15.240
and watering down our institutions

01:15.241 --> 01:18.187
and leaving them meaningless and empty.
