00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.000
I am not trying to throw any shade at all

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.400
I just feel like this needs to be talked about

00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:12.580
cause I don't see it being talked about anywhere

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.680
the people that are taking these hormones and doing these things

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:21.400
to transition to other genders

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:23.700
whether it's a man or a woman

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.600
when you're taking drugs to shut down the natural production of your hormones

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:33.840
that your specific gender

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:37.920
your physiologic design is meant to produce

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:41.140
because men and women have to

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.940
totally different biological and physiologic designs

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.020
and hormonal structures

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:59.140
and when you forcibly shut that down and then take synthetic hormones instead

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.800
you're enacting war on your body

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:08.080
like full blown enacting war on your body

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:14.880
and you can see it you see it in how rapidly these people age and like it

00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.920
the same goes for women that are doing all cause

00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:20.000
like people that are transitioning

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:24.340
and a lot of women are getting the same procedures done

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.640
ah injections um

00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:28.760
hormone replacement to be birth control too

00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:33.000
because birth control also shuts down the natural production of your hormones

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.040
and replaces it when with synthetic ones

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:37.980
that are actually proven to cause cancer

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.140
autoimmunity

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.180
all kinds of very detrimental things to your health and physiologic design

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.000
but like when you get all these things injected

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.060
you get all these procedures done

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.120
you get implants that are foreign objects in your body again

00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:58.920
like even that

00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.160
aside from the hormone like

00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:05.460
replacing your endocrine systems natural

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.060
um

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.080
part in the ecosystem that is your body

00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:13.760
because you are an entire ecosystem

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:17.000
every single component has a very important role

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:21.160
to play in the balance and flow of your entire system

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:25.000
when that falls out of balance or you actually remove an entire piece

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:31.020
like your endocrine system is a very important aspect to your body's function

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.360
and so when you shut that down and then replace it with chemicals

00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:37.900
synthetic chemicals um

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.060
you're causing a lot of health issues

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.280
and I don't see that aspect being talked about

00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:51.780
like all the moral and philosophical ideology and opposing views and whatever

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.660
put that aside and let's just talk about the health component

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.600
and how destructive it is to your body

00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:06.780
and how unnatural it is and how hard it is on your body

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.280
and then what that subsequently does

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:12.320
not just like the dysphoria or like

00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:15.400
whatever mental illness is associated with that shift

00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:16.960
but just the health aspect

00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:17.480
like

00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:21.560
we already know that birth control and hormone replacement causes depression

00:03:21.561 --> 00:03:24.840
and increase like 80% up like

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:29.120
increase in an uptick of being prescribed antidepressants and adolescents

00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:32.400
like there's so much research and data

00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:37.880
that already shows how destructive replacing these hormones are in the body

00:03:37.881 --> 00:03:39.220
and then you add in

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.400
the mental illness component of like

00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:45.140
feeling like you're in the wrong body

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.260
like never do we ever affirm that in someone who has like

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.040
body dysmorphia with you know

00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:55.140
they think they're fat but they're actually like

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.920
terribly skinny and like

00:03:56.921 --> 00:04:01.100
a really unhealthy depleted state of malnutrition

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.080
the same goes here like

00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:05.520
it totally goes here too

00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:07.080
and it's I'm just gonna say like

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:11.080
it's impossible for someone that's doing this to their body

00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:14.560
to be healthy and to be in a healthy state of mind

00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:20.400
because of how unnatural and against nature it goes

00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:22.400
whether you think it's right or wrong

00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:29.100
or whether you think that it's normal or okay to be born in the wrong body

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.220
a we're not talking about the health repercussions

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.940
nor are we asking why no one's asking why this happens

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.380
people therapist

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.980
everyone's just going Whoo

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.080
and then conversy on the other two

00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:48.000
people were just going like

00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:50.700
it's unnatural it's against god

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.180
I'm on the side with god

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.580
but I'm also on the side of like

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.980
we need to give them help

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.340
gender affirming care is not help

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.560
it's not help it's actually like

00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:12.400
both sides are completely missing a really important component

00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:14.980
in my opinion which is

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.960
why are you this way and what can we do to support you in the root cause of why

00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:26.560
I totally believe that societal conditioning is

00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:28.640
is a giant role to play like

00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:30.360
we shouldn't be telling people that

00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:34.160
like little boys and people that are dressing up as girls

00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:36.560
like we shouldn't just jump to be like

00:05:36.561 --> 00:05:37.160
oh my gosh

00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:38.260
you must be a girl

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.720
no like

00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:43.720
it's okay to like

00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:46.360
want to dress up in other clothes

00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:49.220
or whatever parental um

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.920
guidance you think there was

00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:52.280
or lack thereof like

00:05:52.281 --> 00:05:53.760
whatever you wanna call it

00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:54.560
like

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.440
saying that like

00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:59.880
just affirming that you were born in the wrong body is not help

00:05:59.881 --> 00:06:03.420
that is not care that is not health care

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.760
that is actually that should be like

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:07.720
illegal if I'm being completely honest with you

00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:13.980
because I know so many people that were like abused as children

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.340
smexually

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.100
verbally physically

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.680
there are so many times where you don't wanna be in your body as children

00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:35.380
as a woman there are so many times where our circumstances

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.780
make us not wanna be us

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.120
right

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.180
that's why people end their lives

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.720
that's why people run away

00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:48.480
that's why people dress or dye their armpit hair

00:06:48.481 --> 00:06:51.120
or cuddle their hair off or um

00:06:51.121 --> 00:06:52.740
harden their shell

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.660
there's so many symptoms

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.140
and so many areas where it's so blatantly clear that people are just hurting

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.980
it doesn't mean that we need to run away from this body

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.020
that is just a symptom that dissociation

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.520
I grew up in so much trauma

00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:13.880
smexual trauma like

00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:16.000
as a child abandonment

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:18.480
betrayal death um

00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:24.620
not feeling safe there are so many times where I felt like I didn't wanna be me

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.440
and like

00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:29.300
it wasn't safe to be me

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.640
and I've seen so many children and women that are the product

00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:36.640
and men too little boys

00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:42.220
as well that are products of trauma and not feeling safe

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.240
and I feel like it's a cry to feel safe

00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:50.340
to finally feel belonging to finally feel

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.740
in control

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.420
so I just wanna go why not

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.560
it's wrong you're the devil

00:08:01.561 --> 00:08:04.060
like that's not help

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.820
and that's not the answer

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.440
I understand that we're in a war of good versus evil

00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:12.440
light versus dark god versus the devil

00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:15.040
like I'm not questioning that

00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:22.040
that is so evident in so many components of our

00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:24.140
of our lives right now in the media

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.420
in the way the governments ran

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.820
in social media in

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.400
the news like

00:08:32.401 --> 00:08:38.940
there's so many areas where it's so clear that it's good versus evil

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.340
but the division is how we're controlled

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.440
it's there's so much great area

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:50.640
there's so much nuance and it's so unfair and such an injustice to just be like

00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:54.100
you're just evil you have to ask why

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.160
why is this happening that's just because conditioning does

00:08:58.161 --> 00:09:02.100
to predators child predators trauma

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.480
societal conditioning and then we have to go

00:09:05.481 --> 00:09:06.620
how do we fix this

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.180
how do we support the people that feel like they're in the wrong body

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.400
don't just affirm them don't just applaud them

00:09:15.401 --> 00:09:20.200
don't just hand them drugs and surgery on a silver platter

00:09:20.201 --> 00:09:21.380
that's not care

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.200
no

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.520
and neither is telling them that they are like

00:09:27.521 --> 00:09:29.380
against the Bible and against god

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.120
neither of those offer a real solution

00:09:33.121 --> 00:09:35.760
to see them and to validate them

00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:37.680
and to meet them where they're at

00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:40.734
and offer them the support that they actually need
