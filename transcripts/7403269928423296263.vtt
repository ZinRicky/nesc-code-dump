00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.943
this is probably a dead giveaway that I'm 

00:00:01.944 --> 00:00:02.920
balls deep into my 30s

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:04.728
but my baby broccoli are finally ready 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:06.120
and I couldn't be more excited

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:08.600
and that means broccoli is on the menu for the foreseeable

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:12.080
but this herby blanched broccoli salad is so crunchy and so flavoursome

00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:13.840
it's pretty much a crime not to make it

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:15.738
first slice your broccoli, stalks & all

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:16.760
into bite size pieces

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.640
submerge them in boiling water for two minutes

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:21.440
then ice water for two minutes before  draining and patting dry

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:23.280
To this I'm adding some sliced bok choy

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.560
spring onions coriander

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:25.600
mint all from my garden

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:26.192
thank you 

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.200
alongside carrots

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:27.981
capsicum and cashews 

00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:29.320
I wanna go light with the dressing

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:31.178
to really hero the flavour of the broccoli 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.000
Iâ€™m mixing soy sauce

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.520
sesame oil rice wine vinegar

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:35.740
peanut butter lemon juice and brown sugar

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.520
Give it a whisk and then

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:39.335
finish it off with a couple of tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds 

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:40.521
for an extra earthy flavour 

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:42.640
and then I think the trick is to massage the salad

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:43.400
I could be wrong

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:46.080
but I swear it scratches my brain and makes the veggies taste better

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:47.880
I've laid down a bed of seasoned sushi rice

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.000
and I'm topping that with some seared teriyaki chicken

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:53.020
a little bit of extra salad dressing and some homemade toasted nori sheets

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.000
this dinner was very demure, very mindful

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:56.920
there was a good crunch left in that broccoli

00:00:56.921 --> 00:00:58.999
The kids even enjoyed it without complaint 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.580
for a change
