00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.240
Most of the work that you do as a quote,

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:09.281
unquote ally is not with the marginalized group.

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:11.561
It is within your own group.

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:15.321
Step one of the work as a guy is you.

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:16.901
You gotta get some tougher skin.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.580
You got to be able to hear that

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.360
and not run away in defensiveness

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:28.041
or think that it emasculates you to a place that you just can't hear

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:29.241
the truth of a situation.

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:33.641
There's ugly truth about our world and our life,

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:36.381
and if you want to show up and be a part of it,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.500
you. You're gonna catch.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.920
Especially if you're a man,

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:42.381
especially if you're a white man.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.140
You're gonna catch a lot.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.880
And if you run,

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:48.361
you just, like really losing what can be.

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:51.161
We don't even know how beautiful life can be,

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:52.321
what our family life can be,

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:55.321
what this world can be if you actually hit Equality, men,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.880
And step one is grow some fucking skin to handle these conversations,

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:01.921
or else we're screwed.

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:03.346
I'm happy you didn't say grow some balls.
