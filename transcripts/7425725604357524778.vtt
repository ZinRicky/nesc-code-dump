00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.880
you wanna know why motherhood is so isolating and being a mom is so lonely

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:07.320
because the second woman hops on a public forum

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:10.800
whether that be TikTok social media or a mommy Facebook group

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:14.600
and talks about how she's struggling or ways in which she is coping

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.840
everyone dog piles on that woman

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:19.620
and tells them that they are should never have their children

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.640
like I haven't been chronically online this week as much as I usually am

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:25.000
but I've seen the trend going around about the 17 diapers

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.000
and correct me if I'm wrong

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.360
this is a woman who posted a video where she was caring for her child

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.840
and had 17 dirty diapers around her

00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:32.680
and y'all

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:38.440
other mothers hopped on the internet to shame this woman for being unhygienic

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:39.360
unclean and like

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:41.320
not taking care of her baby properly

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:45.240
because other mothers love to shame someone

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.720
because the second that somebody's doing worse than you

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:49.600
you think that you are doing better

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:52.480
because the worst insult a mother can ever receive

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:54.720
is being told that they are a bad mom

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.720
cue the dog pilot cue the sanctum mommies

00:00:57.721 --> 00:00:59.880
instead of looking at that situation and empathizing

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:02.560
being like wow someone who's really struggling

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:04.980
would only be the type of person who's doing that

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.240
that is not a healthy well functioning

00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:08.160
energetic happy

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.560
well adjusted person wow

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:14.160
she must be having a really hard time getting through the day

00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:14.960
no

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.000
and it's because a woman's value is so ingrained in our society

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.960
to be tied to her ability to mother and nurture

00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:28.220
that every single one of us is fucking terrified of being seen as a bad mom

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.200
so instead of lifting each other up

00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:34.200
so the best common denominator is all of us coming together to help

00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:36.120
and make sure everyone's not struggling

00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:38.760
enter the mommy wars the keyboard warriors

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:43.180
and I'm not defending an unhygienic environment for a child

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.420
but what I am saying is I've had days where I could get off the floor

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.280
so maybe if you've never suffered from postpartum depression

00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:54.660
or postpartum anxiety or postpartum OCD or postpartum psychosis

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.020
you can sit there on your high horse and say I would never

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.120
but calling somebody a shit mom does not make you a better mom

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:05.700
and the only one who can tell you that you're a good mom is your grown ass kids

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.960
there is the only opinion that matters

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.640
so until you have a grown child who tells you that you were a fantastic parent

00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:14.740
and they want a parent just like you shut the fuck up
