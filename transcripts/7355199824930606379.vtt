00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.040
My Roman Empire will always be

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:05.880
how my children react to the very real scenarios of parenting

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:07.080
that I was raised with

00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:08.800
so I'm a cycle breaker parent

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:10.440
I am re parenting myself

00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:12.000
I am doing the healing journey

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.060
I am parenting my children in a respectful and conscious way

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.380
very differently than how I was raised

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.480
very differently than how I think a lot of millennial parents were raised

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:21.760
so when my children

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:23.520
my older children were 9 and 7

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:27.060
find out some of the ways that I was parented

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.560
their mind is blown

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:32.320
cause we have lots of conversations about how we handle our big feelings

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:33.920
how we handle our emotions

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:36.680
and I was having one of these conversations recently with my daughter

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:40.040
and I said that I had to learn all of these skills as an adult

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:42.680
which is why I'm teaching them now as children

00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:44.120
because it'll just be a lot easier

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:46.320
so my daughter is brilliant and she has tons of questions

00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:46.880
she's like okay

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.440
well if you were not taught how to like

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:49.760
handle your emotions well

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:53.400
what happened to you when you had big emotions

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.480
and she's 9 she's heard a little bit about it

00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:58.120
but I told her about having to stand in the corner

00:00:58.121 --> 00:00:59.560
told her about time out

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:03.600
and I told her that I had soap or chili peppers part of my tongue

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.940
if I talked back or used a bad word

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.400
the jaw dropped and she goes

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.740
why would they do that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.260
and I had to explain to her it was cause they wanted me to hurt

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.020
they wanted to cause me suffering as a punishment

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.460
and she made this face

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.580
and then said

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.620
I'm really glad you guys aren't doing that to us

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.062
the cycle is breaking
