00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
This is exactly my point. At the time,

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:04.401
she had millions of followers,

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:05.841
and I was a very small creator,

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:09.561
and I very much kind of treated TikTok like my online journal.

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:11.741
And this was just friends that I talked to.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.000
And that video was the turning point.

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.721
It was the first time that I went, like,

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:16.981
viral, viral.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.800
And I did not understand the hate that could come.

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:20.721
I was like, what?

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.961
I'm just a fucking mom on TikTok,

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:24.801
like, talking to my friends.

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:26.581
Why are people coming for me?

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.800
And I literally. It fucking set me on a fucking mental spiral for, like,

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:33.641
eight months

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:36.961
because I had felt so misunderstood and so judged and so hurt.

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.001
And I really. I guess I just didn't fully understand

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.361
that's how the internet works is,

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:40.961
you know. I mean,

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:43.201
now I get it. The hate is what gets you going.

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:45.141
So who gives a fuck? People are good.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.360
Plenty. People got plenty opinions about me.

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:47.961
I don't care now.

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:51.001
But that was one of those fucking moments that turned it for me.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.681
And I just cannot get out of my head

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:55.041
that I think she's a shitty person

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:57.881
because of it. She could have sent me a DM.

00:00:57.882 --> 00:01:01.801
There were other large creators that got tagged in the video that were

00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:02.361
like, yo,

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.721
check this out. They cleared it up and did not come for me.

00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:06.401
Matter of fact,

00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:10.601
mental illness has done me so many fuckings that he has Like,

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:12.401
stitched my videos multiple times.

00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:16.401
He has shared his platform with me so many times to try to, like,

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:19.081
you know, just give me a boost a little bit.

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:22.001
Like, you could tell he's just trying to help me out a little bit.

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:23.681
He could see that the internet came for me hard,

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.341
and it was very undeserved.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.080
And little bitch Mama's Hot was one of the main ones,

00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:29.881
and I fucking cannot stand her.

00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:31.521
She didn't take, you know,

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:33.156
she didn't use her shit responsibly.
