00:01.200 --> 00:02.240
It's been a long day,

00:02.240 --> 00:03.720
as you're probably gonna be able to tell.

00:03.720 --> 00:04.880
I'm so tired.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.680
But I have the hardest time sleeping

00:06.680 --> 00:07.880
ever since I've been pregnant.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.300
I don't know what it is.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.120
So I asked my midwife,

00:11.120 --> 00:14.440
and she told me to make this tart cherry

00:14.440 --> 00:15.640
magnesium mocktail.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.640
And I've also seen it all over TikTok.

00:17.640 --> 00:18.920
I've actually been drinking it,

00:18.920 --> 00:21.320
and I feel like it's been helping.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.560
And Lucky's back,

00:22.560 --> 00:25.280
so I'm gonna make both of us one tonight.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.000
He's never had one, so.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.720
Okay. So I usually start with my magnesium.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.240
I do one scoop.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.940
I'm gonna do one scoop here,

00:34.800 --> 00:36.060
one scoop there.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.460
Then I put some tart cherry juice in,

00:40.800 --> 00:44.700
about this much. I give that a really good mix.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.580
You stop it over there.

00:50.840 --> 00:54.380
Cannot open bottles. Try it. I will try it.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.800
See? You're having trouble, too. No.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.460
Okay, well, that was quick.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.580
Thanks, honey.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.660
Put some ice in it.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.700
I don't like that much ice.

01:13.120 --> 01:17.260
I'm tired. Then I just top it with some sparkling water.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.160
Sometimes I do a soda,

01:20.160 --> 01:23.820
but today we're just gonna do this. There we go.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.540
I'm gonna report back in the morning

01:31.840 --> 01:34.020
and see whether he actually slept better.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.980
How do you sleep
