00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
My toddlers love eating smores,

00:01.921 --> 00:04.041
but they hate how dirty their hands get,

00:04.042 --> 00:04.521
so today

00:04.522 --> 00:08.381
I decided to surprise them with some Smore inspired marshmallows.

00:08.600 --> 00:11.000
Got started by making my Graham crackers

00:11.001 --> 00:12.801
by combining some whole wheat flour

00:12.802 --> 00:14.441
with some butter, brown sugar,

00:14.442 --> 00:15.801
and a couple of other things

00:15.802 --> 00:18.521
before mixing together all my wet ingredients,

00:18.522 --> 00:20.481
which were some milk and some honey.

00:20.482 --> 00:22.681
I combined that, gave that a really good mix,

00:22.682 --> 00:23.961
and once it came together,

00:23.962 --> 00:26.801
I refrigerated it for about an hour and a half.

00:26.802 --> 00:29.001
Decided to go with a crumble instead.

00:29.002 --> 00:32.401
I crumbled up my dough, popped that in the oven to bake until crispy,

00:32.402 --> 00:34.201
and then pulled it out to cool.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.981
In the meantime, I got started on making my marshmallow.

00:37.200 --> 00:41.320
I let my beef gelatin bloom and then heated up some water and honey,

00:41.321 --> 00:44.121
slowly poured that into my stand mixer while whipping,

00:44.122 --> 00:47.281
and once it came together and turned into marshmallow fluff,

00:47.282 --> 00:50.641
I lightly dusted my baking tray with some aero root powder

00:50.642 --> 00:53.121
and transferred all of that marshmallow fluff over

00:53.122 --> 00:55.361
before pressing it down. Obviously,

00:55.362 --> 00:58.841
s'mores need chocolate, so I also melted down some chocolate,

00:58.842 --> 01:00.161
combined that with my marshmallow,

01:00.162 --> 01:02.421
and sprinkled over my Graham crackers.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.360
Once that looked perfect to me,

01:04.361 --> 01:06.721
I let that set for about six hours,

01:06.722 --> 01:10.581
and in the meantime, I obviously had to eat all the marshmallow fluff.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.640
Once it was set,

01:11.641 --> 01:16.301
I cut it into bigger squares and everyone was obsessed with these.
