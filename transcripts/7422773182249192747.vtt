00:00.040 --> 00:02.360
All my toddlers were playing in the backyard.

00:02.361 --> 00:04.121
They asked me for a Capri Sun,

00:04.122 --> 00:06.681
and since I had all the fruit at home to make some,

00:06.682 --> 00:09.741
I told them to give me a minute while I got started.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.920
Favorite one is the multivitamin,

00:11.921 --> 00:15.281
so. So I decided to use some pineapple, pears,

00:15.282 --> 00:18.561
apple oranges, and also some frozen cherries.

00:18.562 --> 00:20.581
I took the skin off my pineapple,

00:20.600 --> 00:25.060
chopped it up, before moving on to my pear and doing the exact same.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.600
Peeled my oranges, cut those into slices,

00:27.601 --> 00:31.201
and then moved on to doing the same with my Granny Smith apple.

00:31.202 --> 00:32.841
Once all of my fruit was chopped,

00:32.842 --> 00:36.521
I put it all in a bowl. I also added some cold grapes.

00:36.522 --> 00:39.301
Then it was time to start juicing all of my fruit.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.200
I started with my pineapple,

00:41.201 --> 00:45.041
moved on to my cherries, and then did all the pineapple after.

00:45.042 --> 00:46.441
Once everything was juiced,

00:46.442 --> 00:48.721
I passed it through a fine mesh strainer

00:48.722 --> 00:51.401
and then added some water to thin it out.

00:51.402 --> 00:53.961
You can add as much or as little water as you want.

00:53.962 --> 00:58.161
Then filled it into their little pouches before grabbing two straws,

00:58.162 --> 01:00.801
opening those up, and our Capri Sun was done.

01:00.802 --> 01:03.761
They were so excited to have this and couldn't wait.

01:03.762 --> 01:06.782
And right as I was done cleaning up, they wanted a second one.
