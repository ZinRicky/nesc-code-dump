Update on how shitty of a person Dave Grohl is.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.320
Because here's the thing. He was known as the nicest guy in rock.

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.401
And he's had so many fucking,

00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:12.961
like, picture opportunities with his kids to show what,

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:13.441
like, a great,

00:00:13.442 --> 00:00:15.721
gentle guy he is. And what did he do?

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:19.781
Motherfucker was accusing his wife of flirting with her tennis coach

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.340
because he knew he was having a fucking affair.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.560
They're not cliches. It's not, like,

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:28.721
made up. It's not women just trying to, like,

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:31.341
get in your head and steal your man.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.880
Like, it's common sense.

00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:35.361
If you feel it in your gut that your man is a piece of shit,

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:37.081
he's probably a fucking piece of shit.

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:39.081
When he's accusing you of shit that you haven't done,

00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:40.361
and it starts to make you question.

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:43.601
Don't question yourself. Don't question yourself.

00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:46.081
It doesn't matter if they're a fucking rich rock star

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:48.281
or your broke homosexual that's,

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:50.221
you know, started out sleeping on your couch.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.420
You know the kind of man that your boyfriend is or your partner is.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.360
And when you have those feelings,

00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:58.321
listen to them.

00:00:58.322 --> 00:01:00.481
Because there's no point in giving someone the benefit of the doubt,

00:01:00.482 --> 00:01:01.481
because what are they gonna do?

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.381
They're gonna use it to fucking hurt you.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.334
I cannot stand this man.
