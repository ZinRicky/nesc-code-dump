00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
I had a different name brand smartwatch,

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.001
but I kept running it through my dryer and, like,

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.421
dropping it and breaking it,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.240
so I needed a new one.

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:15.301
And this one from the TikTok shop is pretty much the exact same thing.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.240
Only difference is it's a lot lighter.

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:19.321
You can tell why the price differences there.

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:22.381
It's just a lot lighter. It feels much lighter on your wrist.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.080
I don't think the bands switch out exactly the same.

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.101
It's like a different way to switch out the bands.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.680
But there's an app that you download,

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:34.281
and it's exactly like the other app that comes with your phone

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:38.281
for your other watch. But I don't know,

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:41.521
it's just so expensive to have that much money on my wrist.

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:44.421
But I like having the heart monitor.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.520
I like being able to check my messages,

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.761
my emails, my everything from my watch.

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:49.401
And, like,

00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:51.441
it's a camera shutter. It's, like, everything.

00:00:51.442 --> 00:00:58.041
So if you're like me and too clumsy to own really expensive shit,

00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:03.501
this from the TikTok shop is very worth it.
