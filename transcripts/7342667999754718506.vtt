00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.920
The single best piece of advice I ever got was

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.000
let the dad struggle 100%.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.440
He's not gonna do it the same way you do.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.680
When I was pregnant with my first,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.880
I remember hearing a lot that

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.240
moms become moms during pregnancy

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.060
and dads become dads after birth.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.040
I think a lot of that is held over from this idea

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.720
that a pregnant woman is somehow

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.760
going to just know what to do when the baby comes out,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.240
that instincts are gonna tap in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.120
and you're just gonna be a super mom from day one.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.760
So although that can be true,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.420
that there's that instant instinct kicking,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.960
it's not true 100% of the time.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.680
What is true is that the birthing parent or mother

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.000
is usually the primary parent of that infant.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.480
So even if you don't know what to do,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.000
you learn trial by fire.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.280
You are in it from day one,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.600
whereas dad might be a little bit slow out of the game.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.520
So as much as it is easy for you to just do bedtime,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.900
you to do every feed,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.000
um, you gotta let the guy struggle.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.040
There is no reason that a dad

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.160
or non birthing partner is in any way

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
less capable than the person who gave birth.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.120
And the sooner that that baby can be soothed

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.140
by both of you,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.480
the sooner you guys are gonna

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.800
get back to a little bit more equal playing field.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.800
And there's truly nothing better than watching

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.560
Your husband

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.760
becoming truly caring,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.020
capable and confident. Dad
