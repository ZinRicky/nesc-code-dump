00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
I just moved, and this is the hottest fucking summer I can think of.

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:07.761
And still, the clothes that I made sure that I could find

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:09.441
and that I could wear in this heat,

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.981
in this move was my halara.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.640
This jumpsuit is amazing. Material is so fucking lightweight.

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:22.181
You can handle in the summer.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060
It fits so nicely, you don't fucking get hot.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.880
It's like, I'm not kidding you.

00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:31.121
I don't wanna feel like shit.

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:31.561
I'm, like,

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:34.761
hot and sweaty, but I don't wanna feel like shit,

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:36.761
and I don't wanna be overly hot,

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:39.061
so this is perfect. The wide legs,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.100
I'm. Feels like I'm still wearing shorts.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.940
The fabric is really light.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.480
It's got pockets. And then when I look at myself,

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:47.081
I'm like, oh, wait.

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:48.221
But I don't look like shit.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.180
Maybe I feel like shit on the inside,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.080
and maybe I could, you know,

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:55.301
fix up the other parts.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.920
But overall, I swear to god,

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:02.941
this Halara jumpsuit, that does come in plus sizes,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.980
so anyone can wear it. Totally summer.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.580
Shittiest situation of life.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.040
Moving,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.959
still I choose my whole arm jumpsuit.
