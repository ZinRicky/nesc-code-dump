00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.380
Are tech companies suppressing information about abortion online?

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.800
This article in the New York Times makes a pretty compelling argument

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:09.121
why yes,

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:10.661
they probably are.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.540
Reproductive health service providers like hey Jane,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.340
Mayday Health, and Aid Access.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.400
We're all talking about how social media and big search engines

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.821
are limiting their information online.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.360
Exhibit A hey Jane has been limited or restricted

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:31.461
or suspended on TikTok four times in the last year.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.400
Instagram also suspended Mayday Health account twice in 2022.

00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:41.141
One of the suspensions literally lasted five days.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.680
Let's not forget that the at feminist account was also

00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:45.481
suspended recently

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:47.541
for 6 days. Hmm.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.520
This doesn't account for all the different times that

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:52.521
post have probably been removed.

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:54.861
That talk about the big A word.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.880
What's also wild is that even to say the word abortion on this video,

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.621
I'm probably gonna be restricted.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.900
And it's not just social media

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.960
being has literally suppressed information from Aid Access.

00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:10.381
A super vital healthcare provider

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.560
that shares and sends abortion pills all around the world

00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:16.301
cannot advertise on their platforms.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.660
Amnesty International is asking that these big tech platforms

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.320
like TikTok, Instagram,

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.761
Bing, Google,

00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:26.181
all of them just share more information.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.560
why is information about abortion suppressed and how do we avoid it?

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:34.321
How do we make sure people can get the accurate information they need?

00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:35.881
If Amnesty International is involved,

00:01:35.882 --> 00:01:37.401
it's clearly a human rights issue.

00:01:37.402 --> 00:01:40.861
Everyone has the right to free accessible abortion information,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.820
reproductive health care information,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.560
and It shouldn't be suppressed

00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:46.961
in a place where most people are getting information

00:01:46.962 --> 00:01:48.061
about their bodies.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.360
What do you think?

00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:50.921
Have you experienced this before?

00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:52.330
