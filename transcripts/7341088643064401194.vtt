00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.280
if you think sharing your location with your partner is for safety reasons,

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:05.781
or out of convenience,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.480
then you're lying to yourself.

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:11.081
it's so funny to me when couples go on to explain that, that's the reason

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:12.041
what it's for.

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:13.361
don't lie to yourself.

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:17.361
you wanna know the real reason why you're sharing locations with your partner?

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:19.381
it's because you wanna stalk them.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.240
come on you can't tell me that's not what it's for.

00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:24.161
like if my partner says he's going somewhere,

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.161
then I'm instantly running to check.

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:27.701
making sure he gets there.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.760
or if he's running late,

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.621
I'm instantly watching him drive down the road,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.620
watching that little dot move around

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.440
We’re stalking our partners,

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:36.961
why are we lying about it?

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:38.281
if they don't respond right away,

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:38.921
you're instantly

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.001
like checking

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:41.101
where you at??

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.400
Not only that, whenever they turn off their location

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:45.241
you're instantly like hmmm,

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:46.561
“what's going on?”

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:47.741
“what's happening?”

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.080
you're never like oh,

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:50.401
“I hope they're safe”

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:53.821
instead you're spiraling because you don't have access to stalking them.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.600
men and women both do this.

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:57.961
why aren't we fully transparent with each other?

00:00:57.962 --> 00:00:59.221
we all do it.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.760
we don’t do it for safety reasons.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:04.061
we do it for convenience of stalking each other.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.540
we do it out of love though,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.878
we're love stalking.
