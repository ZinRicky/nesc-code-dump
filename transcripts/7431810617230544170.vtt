00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.120
Avoidant attachment disorder.

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:04.041
This is one of the first attachment disorders

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:05.481
that Doctor Erica Commissar

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:07.821
discusses in her recently published book,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.720
being there

00:00:08.721 --> 00:00:12.101
why prioritizing motherhood in the first three years matters.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.480
Avoidant attachment disorder

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:15.321
is probably the easiest one for me to discuss

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:16.281
because I already

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:20.401
firsthand know so many people that have this attachment disorder

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:24.121
and you can see it triggle down in every aspect of their life,

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:26.021
especially relationships and dating.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.800
These are the babies

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:30.001
that did not experience enough emotional connection

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:31.621
while they were in their infancy,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.040
become emotionally distant

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:36.241
and avoid connection as a form of coping mechanism

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:40.761
in order to deal with the lack of responsiveness from a caregiver.

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:45.201
So if mom is not being emotionally connected to her baby,

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:46.981
picking her up when baby cries.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.740
Speaking of which, one second back to what I was saying.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.440
As adults, these people appear to be very independent,

00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:57.241
self reliant. They struggle with close relationships

00:00:57.242 --> 00:00:59.581
and may even be best friend hoppers,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.020
and they greatly suppress their emotions

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.840
or even deny them all together.

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:05.961
And lastly, when these avoidant individuals

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:08.401
enter a relationship that becomes somewhat serious

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:11.301
and it's necessary to open up emotionally,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.880
they experience a ridiculous amount of stress.

00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:15.801
And in my experience,

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:19.181
a lot of them end up self sabotaging said relationship

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.860
because in their eyes,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240
anything would be better than opening up emotionally

00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:26.641
because they were let down so much when they were babies.

00:01:26.642 --> 00:01:29.481
Even though it's all subconscious and they don't Really remember it?

00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:30.481
Every time they weren't picked up,

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:33.401
when they cried, every time they didn't feel connected to a mom.

00:01:33.402 --> 00:01:35.961
Maybe she had postpartum. Maybe she just wasn't there.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:39.121
They had to go within themselves and create a defense mechanism

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:43.741
and a coping style, which became the avoidant attachment disorder.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.800
Drop a comment below. I guarantee you have dated someone

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:51.181
or known someone with this avoidant attachment disorder.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.660
Sir, you are being so loud.
