00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.502
so I've spent the last few days 

00:00:01.503 --> 00:00:02.880
rotting in this spot right here

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:04.778
and by rotting I mean catching up on admin 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.280
and blowing my nose while mentally

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:08.120
I'm deep in a court of wings and ruins

00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:09.320
and it turns out if you're sick

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:10.960
you're not cleaning and if you're not cleaning

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:11.853
no one else will 

00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:12.800
and by my standard

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:14.200
this house is fkd like yes

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:15.266
it's not bio hazard 

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:17.240
aside from a few questionable tissues

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:20.600
but I can say I'm confident those tissues origins for a change

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.880
I've dedicated an hour to sorting out my shithole

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:25.440
which is not a sentence that should be taken literally

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:28.520
and spoiler alert one hour turns to two and then two and a half

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:30.840
and halfway through I do have a minor mental breakdown

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.560
but prior to that the clean started well

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:35.520
I was in good spirits I had Chappell Roan blasting on the headphones

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.891
I lit me a few fk off candles to tell everyone 

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:38.800
you know to fk off

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:40.640
and then I came across my husband's laundry system

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.840
which I won't lie deeply triggered me

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:45.280
and it was right about this time that the man in question walked in

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:46.880
with three kids and tie from the park

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:47.960
and I don't know about you

00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:50.240
but I really don't like cleaning with people in the house

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:51.818
mainly cause it's about as pointless as 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:53.200
playing hide and seek with yourself

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:55.080
and family games night is always such a core memory

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:56.560
I just love breaking up arguments

00:00:56.561 --> 00:00:58.791
Bending the rules and packing it up all by myself 

00:00:58.792 --> 00:00:59.640
So for today's clean Iâ€™ve 

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:01.891
decided to go room by room and technically 

00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:03.200
this is just one big room

00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:05.980
it's a split level dual lounge in our very mid century home

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.680
and obviously it's our living area

00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:11.080
so we spend the majority of the time that we live in here

00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:12.600
and don't get me wrong I love living

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:15.169
but I would like to speak to someone about the sheer amount of 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.061
admin created just from being alive 

00:01:17.062 --> 00:01:17.920
and on that note

00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:19.600
I won't be cleaning my kitchen for you today

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:21.640
because that room is currently under renovation

00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:22.920
and it would have been done sooner

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:25.099
if I didn't have to spend 90% of my time 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.960
recleaning the same things over and

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.234
over but it's fine 

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.040
and honestly I might not have seen this sink

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:31.600
 in a worse state than this and please

00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:33.800
someone tell me how they got toothpaste on the wall

00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:35.040
and if I thought the sink was bad

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:36.760
the toilet was so much worse

00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:39.240
and I'm gonna save you that trauma by just doing transition

00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:42.280
the depressing thing about this clean is it looks like I'm doing a lot of stuff

00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:43.760
but I've barely moved the needle

00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:45.720
and I'm almost embarrassed to show you my bedroom

00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:47.520
but fk it I've been rotting in this room too

00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:50.040
so I cleaned literally everything and changed the sheets

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:52.800
but didn't have the energy to film so a transition will have to do

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:54.920
now this is always my favourite part of any clean

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:56.520
mainly because it's so fleeting

00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:58.794
and this part is just a big old hint to my husband 

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:00.400
to buy me some flowers for the table

00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:01.360
once everything was clean

00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:03.000
it was time for me to get stuck into my book

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:04.720
just kidding I've got 3 kids to deal with

00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:06.142
so I can't read till later
