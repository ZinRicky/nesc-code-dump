00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.360
I just wanted to hop on here

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.540
and show you how I do my planning for the day.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.780
Um, so this is like my master.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.640
This is the main little master book that I have

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.820
that I just consistently go day by day and write down,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.700
um, my to do list per se.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.840
Now, I do a method called brain dumping.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.320
I did not come up with this. Um,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.300
someone else did.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.000
But essentially,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.940
you go through

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.360
and you just think, like,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.440
anything that just comes to mind,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.400
you just jot it down

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400
and you make a giant list

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.480
and then you section them.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.300
So I have on here top three.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.620
So you section them

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.160
by the top three things I need to get done on that day.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.360
The Easy 3. So, like,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.200
the tasks that are easier.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.060
So I had, like, laundry,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.280
picking up our bedroom,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.680
cleaning off our desk

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.160
that we have.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.260
That is our catch all.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.440
And then the next three.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.480
So the next three things.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.860
Next three things you want to do after that

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.820
I find very helpful for me. Um, I.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.120
I swear I have ADHD or something.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.280
Just the way my brain works,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.360
it's hard for me to stay on task.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.860
Um, and with this,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.880
it's easier because I can,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.400
like I said,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.320
brain dump everything out of my brain

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.320
onto a piece of paper where I can visually see it.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.080
So I just thought I would share this little method.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.640
It is very Helpful for me.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.292
And it may be helpful for you
