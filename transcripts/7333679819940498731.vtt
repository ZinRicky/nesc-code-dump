00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.280
I love when I go to the grocery store and I'm optimistic like oh

00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:09.521
I'm gonna grab all the ingredients to make this extravagant dinner

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:12.881
maybe I'll make a nice crusted chicken with potatoes

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:16.921
or maybe even steak prepared with a nice salad

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:20.421
options are endless as I'm grabbing all my ingredients

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.640
then I get home,

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:25.101
I stare at my ingredients, I'm tired,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.900
and I completely forget they once had the plan to become a beautiful meal

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.580
what I reached for instead?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.080
crackers and cheese!

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:36.421
maybe a pickle, girl dinner you know?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.620
and all the ingredients go bad,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.920
and then I'm like

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:42.341
darn off to the grocery store again

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.140
and the cycle repeats itself
