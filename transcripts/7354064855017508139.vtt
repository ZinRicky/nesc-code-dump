00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.560
I saw this busy board on TikTok shop and as a homeschool mum

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:03.701
I was interested.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.280
So here I'm testing out with my one year old son.

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:07.761
He was very attracted to the toy

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.181
and was engaged in playing with it for a few minutes.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.300
Up next is my four year old daughter.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.440
She has ADHD and loses focus pretty quickly.

00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:19.121
She loved this toy and was engaged in it for several minutes.

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:20.201
I did take it away from her,

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:20.721
she wasn't done.

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.381
But I did give it to my 7 year old son.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.900
He was very interested in it and wanted to know how it all worked.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.040
I could see this being really useful while travelling

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:29.481
on aeroplane and public transport.

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:32.561
Really did perform on all age groups and they were all interested.

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:33.641
Later on in the evening

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.881
I gave it to my son again when I was breastfeeding

00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:37.381
and it did stop him from twiddling
