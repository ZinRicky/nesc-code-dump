00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.352
a couple of days ago I had my first 

00:00:02.353 --> 00:00:04.240
panic attack in probably a year

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:06.162
and to be honest I've been in two minds about 

00:00:06.163 --> 00:00:07.560
whether or not I even share that

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.040
because I don't wanna bring down the vibes

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.840
I definitely don't want sympathy

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:13.280
and I know that I'm so blessed in so many ways

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:14.840
it just feels wrong to complain

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:16.440
But mental health is funny like that

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.423
and I think it was a reminder to me that 

00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:19.440
healing is not linear

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.440
we have good days and we have bad days

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:22.640
but we share it with someone

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:24.525
we cry without shame when we need to 

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:25.800
and we try again tomorrow

00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:27.706
this evening was one of my first child free 

00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:28.920
nights in a really long time

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:31.320
all I felt like doing was going out into my garden

00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:32.342
grounding my energy 

00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:34.080
spending some time with my husband

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:35.380
having a cheeky drink and 

00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:36.880
sowing some plans for tomorrow

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:37.880
I don't know if it's just me

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:40.000
but the world feels pretty heavy at the moment

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.240
and if you're sensitive and you already have stuff going on

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.480
it can feel like a lot 

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:44.680
So take time when you need it

00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:47.102
and invest it into the things that make you feel good
