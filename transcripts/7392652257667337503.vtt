00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.640
First of all, we should address the elephant in the room,

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:06.481
which is that your Christmas tree is still up

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:08.441
and your ornament is still.

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:09.801
Barbie's still here? Yeah,

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:12.361
she's here to protect us. She's not doing a great job.

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:14.781
Yeah, she needs to step it up.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.960
Today's episode

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:19.841
we discuss something that has been going around the internet

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:23.981
called the Dating Matrix. The dumb, smart, evil,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.440
sweet dating matrix. Yes,

00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:29.241
and we're gonna show you what it looks like.

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:30.781
Okay, so draw.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.360
Cause it's science. It's scientific,

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:36.121
it's important. Oh no, no,

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:38.781
that is weird. Why did I do it that way?

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.000
This is why teachers are heroes.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.801
Yes, truly.

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:46.041
And must be protected at all cost.

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:50.561
On the right we have. We have sweet.

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:52.861
The left. That is a left.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.460
On the second quadrant. Third quadrant. Quadrant.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.820
I'm still learning. I thought it was a graph.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.220
Haha.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.420
Sweet

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.300
and dumb. Here we have sweet, smart,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.660
evil and dumb.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.540
And here we have evil and smart.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.100
What's your order?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.940
What's yours?

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.072
This looks. Can I see it
