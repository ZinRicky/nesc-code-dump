Today is hair braiding day,

00:01.721 --> 00:04.321
so let's get ready to go get some box braids.

00:04.322 --> 00:05.561
This is my hair routine.

00:05.562 --> 00:08.361
I wash my hair every two weeks with the shampoo

00:08.362 --> 00:10.641
and then go in with this keratin treatment.

00:10.642 --> 00:12.641
Let that sit in my hair for a few minutes,

00:12.642 --> 00:13.441
rinse that out,

00:13.442 --> 00:18.241
and then scrub my scalp before I go in with deep conditioner.

00:18.242 --> 00:20.601
I like to make sure that my hair is just really,

00:20.602 --> 00:23.041
really clean, but also hydrated.

00:23.042 --> 00:25.601
And then I go in with a few other products

00:25.602 --> 00:28.321
after I've gotten out the shower.

00:28.322 --> 00:30.641
One of the things I hate doing is my hair.

00:30.642 --> 00:31.801
I don't know what it is.

00:31.802 --> 00:32.801
It hurts my arm.

00:32.802 --> 00:37.501
It's not fun. So lucky offered to do my hair for me. And blow it all out.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.120
People seem to think that I hate my curly hair

00:40.121 --> 00:42.681
or that I want to be more white by doing this.

00:42.682 --> 00:44.561
I don't. I used to have really,

00:44.562 --> 00:46.441
really bad eczema on my scalp,

00:46.442 --> 00:48.241
which caused me to lose a bunch of hair,

00:48.242 --> 00:49.741
constantly be flaky.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.520
So in order for me to feel confident,

00:51.521 --> 00:53.281
I decided to chop it all off

00:53.282 --> 00:56.621
and wear a style that would cover up the front of my hair.

00:56.720 --> 01:00.040
Which is why I also haven't gotten braids in almost two years now,

01:00.041 --> 01:02.701
because my scalp wouldn't have been able to handle it.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.240
But now, being pregnant,

01:04.241 --> 01:06.921
my eczema has not flared up in nine months,

01:06.922 --> 01:07.801
which is great.

01:07.802 --> 01:12.081
So I decided to get Some knotless braids for this baby's birth.

01:12.082 --> 01:15.281
I just don't wanna be dealing with washing my hair or combing it out

01:15.282 --> 01:16.441
or doing anything,

01:16.442 --> 01:17.961
so I always get braids

01:17.962 --> 01:20.761
or a different protective style before I go into labour

01:20.762 --> 01:22.221
or go on holiday.

01:22.240 --> 01:25.880
I wanted to leave out some hair in the front to give it a feathery,

01:25.881 --> 01:28.321
light look, but I ended up not liking it

01:28.322 --> 01:30.961
and decided to just braid them all the way down.

01:30.962 --> 01:33.241
And 10 hours later we were done.

01:33.242 --> 01:34.521
And yes, my butt hurt,

01:34.522 --> 01:36.181
but it was totally worth it.
