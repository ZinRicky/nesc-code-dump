00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.360
so in the same way

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:03.641
if my friend came to me and said hey Enitza

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:04.921
I'm thinking about trying meth

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:06.041
it looks really good

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:07.421
I might get some energy

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.840
you know there's some side effects

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:09.641
but I'll deal with it

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.401
I would not support that choice

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:15.221
I totally understand supporting a woman's right to choose

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.960
if you go back to this original video

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:19.121
it's about me sitting in the food stamps office

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:22.841
waiting to get approved because I decided to be a Tradway for 10 years

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:26.281
and give everything up and just support this man with my life

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:27.321
and that left me here

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:28.641
a single mom to four kids

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:29.681
one of them is disabled

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:31.021
doing everything on my own

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.780
she came to me and said

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.640
hey I'm gonna jump out of an airplane without a fucking airbag

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:36.841
I really think I can do it

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.741
I got this really cool shirt I can do it

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.220
not gonna support that choice

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.080
you know what I mean

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:42.961
yes we do all have choices in life

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:45.081
some of those choices are stupid as fuck

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:48.121
and we should have friends in our life that are telling us bitch no

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:52.041
and I'm gonna be that friend for every fucking person that sees me

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:56.361
because it is not wise to give up your autonomy and independence

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:58.961
to support another human being on this planet

00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:00.021
you gotta eat

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.200
you gotta live

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:04.561
and you're the only person who cares enough about you

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:06.367
to make sure that that happens
