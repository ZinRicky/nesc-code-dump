00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
And you know who should be leading that charge?

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.880
Feminist. A single mom who has one job,

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:08.601
living in the Midwest. One of her children is under 3.

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:12.001
Is she paying more taxes then the man

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.361
who is a major stakeholder in corporate America,

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:16.881
probably living in New York City?

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:17.881
Oh, yes.

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:20.481
Favorite example of this one is Jeff Bezos,

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.001
one of the richest guys in the world.

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:26.061
He pays a lower tax rate than a Boston public school teacher.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.080
We need those billionaires paying more

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.161
because there are a lot of investments we need to make in America.

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:35.961
The United States is 35th out of the 37 richest nations in the world.

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:38.961
We're 35th in terms of what we spend on childcare.

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:41.881
That's terrible. And I try to push this in Congress.

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:43.321
You know what the first answer is?

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:45.201
Well, we just can't afford it.

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:47.081
The money is just not there.

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:51.081
It's choices. Either the billionaires get a bunch of tax loopholes,

00:00:51.082 --> 00:00:52.561
or we make them pay.

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:56.161
And then we use that money to invest in things like childcare

00:00:56.162 --> 00:00:57.481
and more housing.

00:00:57.482 --> 00:01:01.558
We use it to build an America that works for everybody.
