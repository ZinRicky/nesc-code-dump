00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.480
So I'm still here in Utah in Park City.

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:03.801
I'm here for the wine festival.

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:06.041
I'm here to cover it for their social media team.

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:08.361
But I wanted to talk about some of the, like,

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:09.481
rumors and misinformation

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:11.361
I'm seeing spreading about Western North Carolina

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:12.521
happening on the internet.

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:15.721
And listen, TikTok can be a wonderful place to spread information.

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:17.681
It can be a wonderful place to get the word out.

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:20.321
It can also be a great place for people to follow down

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:22.201
rabbit holes of conspiracy theories.

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:24.481
I've been seeing things about lithium mines,

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.801
about bulldozing the town of Chimney Rock,

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:29.401
about the fact that the government sent the Hurricane

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:31.601
or that somehow created it.

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:33.681
Marjorie Taylor Greene had a tweet that said, like,

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:35.281
of course they can control the weather.

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:38.461
No, that is insane.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.520
I've seen people saying, uh,

00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:44.941
this is because they wanna wipe out all of the red voters

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.320
for the election. Those people must have never been to Asheville,

00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:50.121
because Asheville is a little blue dot, okay?

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:53.201
Those people are more hippie than the people of Burlington, Vermont.

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:54.241
Okay, granted,

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.661
the surrounding areas probably a little red,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.560
but storms are not politically motivated, okay?

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:01.261
Storms are natural disasters.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.780
Nobody, no matter who they vote for,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.440
deserves that to happen to them

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:07.661
or is being punished for their politics.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.300
The only thing that matters is donating,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.520
getting money to the organizations that are working up there

00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:15.441
and getting supplies to the people that need it.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:19.001
Okay, there are Tons of local organizations that are organizing.

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:20.341
Churches, restaurants,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.380
um, the World Central Kitchen.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.900
Donate, help. Don't spread crazy shit.
