00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.240
More women die

00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:04.241
giving birth in the US than in any other industrialized country,

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:05.601
which means that, like,

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:06.681
having sex with a man,

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:09.301
if you're an American woman in 2024,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.280
is one of the most dangerous things that you can do.

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:13.601
In a world where access to birth control is being threatened

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:16.081
or women are being criminalized for doing IVF,

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.801
where our period apps are being tracked and surveiled,

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.601
and that even if we have a miscarriage,

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:21.521
can be used against us

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.681
as grants for suspicion that we had an abortion,

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:25.401
why would women risk it?

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:27.301
Like, increasingly, women are not.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.360
they're not gonna get more babies out of us.

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:32.921
And consistently voting against fraternity leave and maternity leave

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:33.761
and paid leave,

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:36.761
universal childcare, will mean that women have more babies with men.

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:39.134
It'll mean that they might start avoiding them.
