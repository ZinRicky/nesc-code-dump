00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.780
I think the reason that I was put on this earth was drink little fruity tea

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.480
sit in a park and watch the ducks

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.880
and I blame capitalism for the reason why I can't do this all time

00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:09.720
just kidding I forgot

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.360
the problem is

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:11.960
as always old weird men

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:15.380
not even five minutes after I filmed that

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.240
some random old guy came and sat next to me

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.760
he came to sit down next to me and he was looking at me and like

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:21.680
I'm not delusional

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:22.800
I know exactly what I look like

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.140
I just don't want to get a tan line 

00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:26.560
 obviously I'm on guard and I keep catching him look at me and like

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:28.120
you know maybe it's just cause we're the only two people there

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.280
I don't know but also there was so much space in the park

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:33.000
he sat down like four feet from me

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.680
and then he got a phone call and put his phone up to his ear

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:37.680
pointed directly at me

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.280
and like maybe I'm just being paranoid

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:41.520
but I really don't think that I was

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:44.960
but like regardless I just felt unsafe and like that sucked

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.400
and it sucks that as women we have to possibly be on guard and can't just like

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:49.480
sit in a parking door

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:52.158
so it's fine I'm fine hanging out with the ducks
