00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.520
Today I wanted to try out a fun new makeup product.

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:05.461
This is the Tarte Blush and glow.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.080
Um, has a bunch of different blushes and highlighters to give you, like,

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.401
all super glowy cheeks.

00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:12.121
So I'm gonna do my base makeup,

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:13.901
and then we're gonna try some of these products out.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.280
Now, I always keep a vintage flare to my makeup,

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:17.801
but as we get into the warmer months,

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:20.941
I definitely try and go with a glowier,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.440
more, like, luminous skin.

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:25.681
So I'm really excited about this product.

00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:27.001
Okay, I finished hair makeup,

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.601
and now we're gonna get into the cheeks.

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:30.481
Using. There's a couple different options.

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:34.321
So I think I'm gonna use this super pink one, and then this more,

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:35.701
like, neutral,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.960
like, frosty highlight.

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:39.521
So the ones I'm gonna use are pink,

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:42.621
and pearl Glow has this really sweet little applicator,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.480
so I'm just gonna put a couple dots up here.

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.921
Oh, that's really shimmery already.

00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:50.101
That's really pretty.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.620
See, on the other side,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.600
you could use a brush to blend it out,

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:57.821
but I kind of always love using my fingers for cream products,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.960
and that just gives, like,

00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:00.721
a really pretty flush of color.

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:02.301
Like, nothing too crazy.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.520
And add a little more just right here on the middle.

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:05.361
With a liquid product,

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:08.001
it's always good to start a little bit reserved and build,

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:08.721
because you never know how,

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:10.201
like, pigmented something's gonna be.

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.381
Okay, that is gorgeous.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.800
Now to add a little bit more Highlight.

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:16.721
I'm gonna go in with this pearl color right up here,

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:17.281
and this is, like,

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:18.841
my favorite color for a highlight.

00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:22.981
For me, it's, like, a neutral pearly white silver.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.280
Gonna add a little to the top of my nose and, like,

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:27.301
right here.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.180
Okay, that is truly.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.480
That is glowing.

00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:33.961
I love that. Okay,

00:01:33.962 --> 00:01:35.121
so definitely,

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:37.161
definitely go ahead and try these.

00:01:37.162 --> 00:01:38.561
I'm gonna try more of the

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:41.001
warmer colors when I get a little bit of tan going

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:41.921
here in the summer,

00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:45.081
but these are fantastic products if you want that,

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:45.881
like,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.080
very natural flesh,

00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:50.423
like a perfectly ethereal cheek.
