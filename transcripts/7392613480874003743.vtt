00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.280
it's about dang time we finally get to make this coffee

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:03.240
I made breakfast with my kids

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:05.320
and just an entire bag of oranges at this point in the morning

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:07.040
now my kids are just chatting away about scrub daddies

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:10.520
because we saw the Halloween scrub daddies on TikTok Shop and they're obsessed

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:13.560
we had a full 30 minute conversation about the different shapes of scrub daddies

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.560
so they should have for different seasons and different events that happened

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:18.600
like why we didn't have shark scrub daddies for Shark Week

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:19.720
I don't even know if those exist

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:21.080
but scrub daddy if you're listening

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:22.080
we need Shark Scrub Daddy

00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:24.200
you're probably wondering how we got down this rabbit trail

00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:26.480
well my kids love the different coloured scrub daddies

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:27.720
and it has encouraged them to clean

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.680
so I'm 100% gonna be buying them in every colour

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:32.080
just so they'll clean their own bathroom

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:34.680
because I am pretty sure those kids get toothpaste everywhere

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:35.774
except their toothbrush
