00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
When my marriage started to feel like my parents marriage growing up,

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.301
I realised, hmm,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.600
I bet my kids are probably gonna end up in a marriage just like this

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:14.701
as well, because it's their example.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.840
So if I want them to do any different,

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:20.101
I'm gonna have to do different.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.560
And it like all clicked. That's when I realized

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:24.881
it's better to leave

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:28.101
than to stay in a marriage that you're not happy with.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.260
And it's okay to show your children that you are a human being.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.080
And it's okay to show your children that you can change your mind.

00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:40.721
That's a really big thing that our children need to learn.

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:42.481
It's, it's okay to say,

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:44.281
you know what? That was one thing,

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:47.061
but I changed my mind, I wanna do this now.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.460
And the only way they're gonna learn is if they see it through example.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.720
And because your mom, whether you're a boy or a girl,

00:00:54.721 --> 00:01:01.701
mom, is the most impactful example we have in life,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.300
it's really important for mom to take care of herself

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.680
because

00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:09.381
that's how your kids are gonna know how to take care of themselves.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.520
But

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:15.101
when you teach your kids how to sacrifice yourself for everybody else,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.420
that's what they're gonna end up doing.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.880
And I think most moms just want their kids to be happy.

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.161
We just want our kids to grow up and be happy.

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:24.861
I just want you to be a good person

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.000
and I want you to Be happy deep down in your heart.

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:28.661
Whatever that means for you.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.760
So if that's what you want for them,

00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:34.566
you have to show them how.
