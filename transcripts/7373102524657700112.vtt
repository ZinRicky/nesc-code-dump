00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.080
this room has put the pain in painting

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:03.317
but because I put the mental 

00:00:03.318 --> 00:00:04.000
in mental health

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.080
and I don't know how to stop when I'm fixated on something

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:07.880
so far I've tried five different colours

00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:09.720
first it was the mustard limoncello combination

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:11.308
which actually sounds kinda delicious 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.520
then we tried a soft terracotta

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.680
then I gave up and we painted everything white before

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.340
I tried again and thought maybe we'd go tonal with a deep brown

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.840
a lot of people have commented telling me the orange wood is ugly

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:20.840
and I just need to white wash it

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:22.920
and a previous version of me might have to be honest

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.600
but I actually like it! it's super retro

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:26.040
has tons of character and it feels like 

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.120
the heart and soul of the home

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:28.600
so I'm gonna challenge myself to make it work

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:29.760
so I found some inspiration

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:30.720
put together a mood board

00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:31.360
cause by the way

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:34.200
that stone sample is actually gonna be my fireplace surrounds one day

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.440
and filled with blind confidence

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:37.880
cause you know I'm a big fan of positively gaslighting yourself

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:38.707
I took off to Dulux 

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:40.320
and this might make you shake your head

00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:41.560
but I didn't even sample it

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:43.160
I just fkn committed which is probably

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:43.520
you know

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:46.200
the sort of behaviour that got me into this situation in the first place

00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:48.440
but what even is life unless it's slightly spicy

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.029
plus I had a really good feeling that this 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.175
colour was gonna be the colour 

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:54.000
never mind the fact that I also had that feeling over the other five colours

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:54.920
if you don't already know

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.465
one thing you should know about this room 

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.680
is it's actually two rooms in one

00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:58.360
and one half

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:01.031
a half that you can't see gets a shit ton of natural light 

00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:01.620
and this half doesnâ€™t 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.253
so I needed to find a blue that was blue 

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:04.600
enough that you could tell it was blue

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:06.000
but dark enough that it was still Moody

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.640
but not too dark that it just looks black

00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:07.972
you know 

00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:10.040
and if you've watched any of my other renovation content

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:11.860
you will know I'm a big fan of a deep green

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.040
and a lot of people suggested painting this room green too

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:15.440
and you're right it would look lovely

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:16.720
especially with that orange wood

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.520
But the room directly off this one is my dining room

00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:19.800
and I've already painted that one green

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:20.840
and as much as I love green

00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:22.320
I don't want every room to be green

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.200
do you know what I mean

00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:23.960
K not a word of a lie

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:25.337
this next part had me sweating 

00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:27.160
cause as much as I love the heritage wood

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:28.200
I don't love it everywhere

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:29.600
and there is a lot in the house

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:29.920
so

00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:30.816
I got rid of some of it 

00:01:30.817 --> 00:01:32.720
But it made this other half look more like a feature wall

00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:33.396
which I love 

00:01:33.397 --> 00:01:35.640
up next we're cleaning this room within an inch of its life

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:36.766
so come back for the update
