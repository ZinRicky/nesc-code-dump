00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.740
Come on, my beloved relations.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.180
I stand here today a voice for freedom,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.300
a call for healing.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.840
I prayed, oh,

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:18.501
I prayed for freedom from the ancestral pain passed on through time.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.900
I asked for strength to forgive,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.780
to heal the scars, both yours and mine.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.340
I found freedom, my people,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.584
and the breath of our lands and the strength of our spirit.
