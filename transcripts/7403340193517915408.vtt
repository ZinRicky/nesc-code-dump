00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
okay the more I look into this

00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:03.360
the more fishy it is and it just seems a bit tone deaf

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:05.680
and it absolutely is really tone deaf

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:07.280
and I wanna break it down

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:09.100
Wanna break down why

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.340
the way that this film is being promoted is harming survivors

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.680
why survivors feel betrayed by it

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.840
and why this actual conversation

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:20.700
and the way that the dialogue around this is playing out is actually

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.480
kind of a good thing so I'm Doctor Zoe

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.160
I have a PhD in feminism

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:27.600
specifically looking at social media and why survivors share their stories

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.860
so firstly this film is based on a romance novel

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.080
this is predominantly it's a fiction book

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:36.880
it might be still based on some true elements from the author's life

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:42.440
but it is a fiction book and fiction is so important for survivors

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:44.720
and I'll tell you why sometimes

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:47.760
survivors come across books and stories

00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:49.400
and TV shows and movies

00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:52.300
that really speak to the nuances

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.720
and specifics of their domestic violence experience

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:59.880
and the thing about experiencing domestic violence or an abusive relationship

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:02.300
is that one of the key

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.180
commonalities between people's experiences is a feeling of isolation

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.780
they feel alone

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.520
they feel like no one understands what they've been going through

00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.840
they feel completely debilitatingly alone

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:16.400
and then

00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:22.360
they stumble across a text that seems to just explain exactly what has happened

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:24.600
and in a way like fiction can do this

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:29.540
in a way that looking up information about what might be happening to you can't

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.720
um I've had this experience myself as a survivor where I've read books

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:35.640
I've just gone oh my God

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:37.120
like that just spoke to me

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:38.760
and I know that I have not read this book

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:43.220
but I know that people who have feel that this book really spoke to them

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.860
and was able to touch them

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.920
because it deals in quite a nuanced way also

00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:52.160
I hear um

00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:54.840
with themes of domestic violence

00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:56.300
okay and this is key

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.940
but moving on to the way that the film has been promoted

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.620
Blake Lively has been promoting it like a brand

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.280
she has got a brand for it

00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:09.820
the florals she's saying wear your florals and bring your girlfriend

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.520
and then people have seen her also promoting her own personal hair products

00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:16.580
and things like that um

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.880
as well as just using a tone that's very bubbly

00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:22.620
and light hearted and fun throughout

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.800
along with lots of cookie cutter responses to questions about domestic violence

00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:31.320
and the film's content but it's not working

00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:35.120
and it's not working because we are all too media literate for this

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:35.640
these days

00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:39.000
you cannot control the narrative the way you wanna control the narrative

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:41.120
because we know too much and we

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:42.440
people see people know

00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:43.460
people go oh

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.440
you're promoting a personal hair care brand

00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:47.660
are you leveraging off of a really

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.720
you know meaningful film with lots of dark themes

00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:53.960
to promote something like your hair care product

00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:58.040
to make personal to grow your personal wealth because we're not okay with that

00:02:58.041 --> 00:02:59.880
and we can see it and recognise it

00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:01.220
and a few years ago

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.800
it might not have been picked up on and it might have been kind of accepted

00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:06.080
and nowadays it's not

00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:10.100
and I think what we're also saying is that Blake Lively has a comfort zone

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.980
and it does not extend to speaking about the nuances of domestic violence beyond

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.160
you are more than a survivor

00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:19.480
you're more than that story

00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:21.080
you are whatever you want it to be

00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:26.680
and so what that tells us and audience who has graduated past Beyonce

00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:30.120
putting the word feminist up on a screen behind her

00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:34.120
we are in 2024 we're not in 2014 anymore

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:36.000
and her feminism is back there

00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:38.320
so she's speaking in platitudes

00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:45.180
she's using flowery language to describe these broad feministy feminine ideals

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.320
and it is not working on the audience that are too grown up for that

00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:51.920
because we're not at Gossip Girl anymore

00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:57.000
so she it feels like she's more comfortable with playing into the ROM com

00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:01.040
playing into idea like this is a film about the nuances of being a woman

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:04.760
and women can be messy and women can be this and women can be that

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:07.600
and like we already know that and that's like really great

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:10.900
but like we need to go beyond that now for this conversation

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.540
but she seems much more comfortable staying in that zone

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.160
and staying in that zone of

00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:18.520
this is a fun romcom so

00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:24.100
it's starting to feel like she's trying to make the film more

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.440
frivolous than it actually is

00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:28.840
and it makes you wonder if she had any briefing

00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:32.640
or training around the fact that this is a domestic violence film

00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:34.420
because like at my organization

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.880
we have that conversation with people

00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:38.080
we say when they come to work with us

00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:40.740
we say you're now working for this organization

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.000
so people are gonna wanna talk to you a lot more about domestic violence

00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:47.100
and then we equip them with the skills they need to have those conversations

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.620
cause it's not just about doing it at work

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.040
it's about the fact that your life around work is also gonna change

00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:56.640
and probably involve a lot more discussion about this difficult topic

00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:58.200
so when we put all of this together

00:04:58.201 --> 00:04:59.880
we can see that we have an actress here

00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:02.780
who doesn't seem to wanna engage in the themes

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.520
and doesn't seem to understand the themes

00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:05.400
and then we go okay

00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:11.500
but she played the main character who was a victim survivor in this film

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.500
so did she properly engage with the character

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.840
and then we start to feel betrayed because we go

00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:19.360
well this was a really important text

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.020
and a really important conversation about these things

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.800
this text really meant a lot to a lot of people

00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:27.160
and it was also for those who didn't know the book already

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:32.380
it's an opportunity to engage with this kind of topic again

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.580
and to speak to a whole lot more survivors

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.440
and people start feeling betrayed

00:05:36.441 --> 00:05:40.820
because they start feeling like the way that the actor engaged in the film

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.300
um engage in the content was inauthentic

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.760
and then we have a problem

00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:49.620
because the last thing that a film wants is to be seen as inauthentic

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.760
people are feeling emotional

00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:53.520
people are feeling and rightly so

00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:56.800
and feeling betrayed by the way that this is coming across

00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:58.000
so some people are saying well

00:05:58.001 --> 00:06:00.800
it's just the actress she shouldn't be

00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:05.480
have to be be expected to have like a DV professional level of knowledge

00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:11.200
and that's fair but she should have been trained and she should be a little more

00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:16.300
I guess on top of the fact that this is a really important conversation

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.980
and seeing this as an opportunity to rise to that occasion

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.820
and I think that it is absolutely valid that people feel betrayed by this

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.980
um kind of turn of events

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.680
and I think it's also a really

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:33.960
really good thing because what it shows is that we're at a level now

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:36.600
where we have a baseline level

00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:39.260
understanding of DV and how it plays out

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.760
and we can hold people accountable to that level

00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:46.920
we should and we can and it's absolutely okay to

00:06:46.921 --> 00:06:50.920
and when we see people with huge platforms in Hollywood talking about this issue

00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:53.320
and not doing it in a trauma informed way

00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:55.480
not doing it in a survivor centric way

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:59.520
it is absolutely okay to hold them account and say do better

00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:01.400
because next time there's a film about this

00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:05.214
they'll look at this as a case study and hopefully they will do better
