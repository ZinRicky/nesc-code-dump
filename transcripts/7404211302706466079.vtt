00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.320
The hardest part about making the choice to get a divorce is like,

00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:05.641
am I making the right choice?

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:07.081
Am I making the right choice?

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:11.941
But if you've been struggling with that decision for such a long time,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.920
you should probably. You should get a divorce.

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:17.841
The first step in doing anything is thinking about it.

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:19.601
So the fact that you're thinking about it

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.561
and you can't stop thinking about it,

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:23.441
and your thoughts always go there,

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:25.961
and you never seem to fix the problem.

00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:28.861
Things never seem to kinda get quite right.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.360
It's. You're.

00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:33.161
The reason you're holding on is because you know that divorce is hard,

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:34.441
so you're just trying to avoid the hard thing.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.421
Because it would be so much easier,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.780
so much fucking easier,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.800
if he would just wake the fuck up and realize, like, hey,

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:42.881
I'm a person, too.

00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:44.161
Hey, I'm a person, too.

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:48.541
And you're not fucking crazy for feeling like, hey,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.640
I'm a fucking person, too.

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:52.701
My feelings matter, too.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.980
They sure as fuck want you to feel crazy,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.520
and they sure as fuck want you to think, well,

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:58.481
you're just not doing as much as the other women.

00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.041
You're just not as good as the other women.

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:01.361
You're not as strong as the other women.

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:03.441
They're trying to continue that pick me game

00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:06.001
that got us there in the first place,

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:07.321
but it doesn't work

00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:10.341
after you're a little bit older and very much tired.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.520
So if you have that nagging feeling,

00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:17.241
Inside, you're not crazy.

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:20.401
You're not a bad woman. You're not a bad wife.

00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:22.141
You're not a bad mother.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.860
You're gonna make it. You'll be okay.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.200
You'll find your fucking way.

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:32.001
Just like if that. When you're in a shitty marriage like that,

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:34.701
you're the one that's always figuring everything out. Anyway,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.520
when the problems arise, you're the one that has to like,

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:38.321
oh, my god,

00:01:38.322 --> 00:01:39.921
fine, I'll fucking do it myself. Anyway,

00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:42.241
you're the one that fixes the shit and cooks the shit

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:45.161
and does the shit. And even no matter what the fucking problem is,

00:01:45.162 --> 00:01:47.681
you're probably the one that does everything. Anyway,

00:01:47.682 --> 00:01:50.261
it's not exactly what you thought it was gonna be.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.600
So you're gonna be okay when you leave,

00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:54.641
because you are that resourceful person.

00:01:54.642 --> 00:01:57.981
You are capable of doing everything that you're already doing

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.740
and then doing it without that weight.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.404
That's called the fucking glow up.
