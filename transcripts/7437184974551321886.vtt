00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
I, I don't wanna talk about the shitty heavy stuff.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.140
I wanna tell you something super cool.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.600
My daughter is a freshman in high school

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:10.101
and she fucking came home and told me. Mom,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.240
did you know that my school does dual enrollment

00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:17.001
and I can take college classes at the same time?

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:22.801
I'm going to high school and I can graduate high school with,

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:24.921
if not with my whole ass associate degree.

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:26.541
Damn near close to it.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.820
And the college I wanna go to only has an 11% acceptance rate.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.620
So I wanna make sure I can do everything I can do to get in.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.420
And I could die happy. Jesus fuck! Oh my god.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.680
That's like

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:51.021
the happiest thing I ever could have heard from my daughter.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.080
She's not planning her fucking wedding.

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:55.401
She's not picking out baby names at 14.

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:58.081
She's looking up the acceptance rate

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.841
for the college she wants to get into

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:03.741
and right now making moves to make sure she can get there.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.840
And I think part of why she does that

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.541
is cause she knows she's loved and supported.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.200
And I don't know,

00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:14.661
that felt like a huge fucking win. And I think

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.320
it's important to celebrate those wins.

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:19.741
And I like,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.140
I.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.960
I don't think I've ever felt that amount of love and pride in my heart

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:31.401
ever. For anything ever.

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:33.101
Like, I didn't know.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.440
I didn't. I, man,

00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:37.161
I just. I mean,

00:01:37.162 --> 00:01:39.801
of course you dream that your kids are gonna Have dreams

00:01:39.802 --> 00:01:41.461
and that they're gonna, like,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.280
take steps to make those dreams happen and stuff.

00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:45.101
But, like,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.320
just. I don't know.

00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:49.401
I don't know. That was like the coolest fucking thing ever.

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:51.961
And I just wanted to share it with the world

00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:53.421
cause I'm so proud of her.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.260
I'm so proud of her

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.725
and it. But, yeah.
