Have you ever crave something you've never had before,

00:02.680 --> 00:04.780
but it sounds so good in your mind?

00:04.960 --> 00:06.400
That's what happened to me today,

00:06.400 --> 00:08.640
and that happens a lot now that I'm pregnant.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.560
So today I decided to act on it

00:10.560 --> 00:12.440
and make exactly what I was craving,

00:12.440 --> 00:15.340
which was papaya and lime whipped cream.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.520
So I started by zesting my lime

00:17.520 --> 00:20.540
and then adding some heavy cream to my mixer.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.240
And so I was craving something sour.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.720
I added a whole lime to my heavy cream

00:25.720 --> 00:27.100
and some powdered sugar.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.880
I got distracted at this point

00:28.880 --> 00:30.400
so I over whip my cream,

00:30.400 --> 00:31.700
but it was still fine.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.520
I added all of my lime zest into my cream

00:34.520 --> 00:35.660
and folded it in.

00:36.080 --> 00:40.240
Then I cut my very ripe papaya in half and deseeded it.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.600
There's nothing better than papaya and lime.

00:42.600 --> 00:46.000
So I added even more lime to my papaya

00:46.000 --> 00:48.900
before I blend in my whipped cream,

00:49.080 --> 00:50.880
just to give it a little bit more texture.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.180
I also added a sprinkle of coconut sugar on top

00:54.520 --> 00:56.360
and this was so delicious.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.900
It was actually exactly what I was craving.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.520
And now watching this video back,

01:00.520 --> 01:02.740
I actually need to go make them again.
