00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.572
I’ve talked about the modern day trad wife before

00:00:03.573 --> 00:00:05.641
 modern day traditional wives

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:07.921
who are out there taking care of their man

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:09.001
who are generally hot

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.145
they take care of themselves and they usually cook, clean 

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:13.446
do all the house chores 

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:15.072
like they did back in the 50s 

00:00:15.073 --> 00:00:15.561
with ease

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:16.641
they don't complain

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:17.701
they're happy

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.860
why are they happy

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.080
they trust their man to lead the relationship

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:22.401
they respect him

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:23.901
depend on their man

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.521
there's nothing wrong with that ladies 

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:27.001
they usually have their own business

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.681
so they're not just depending on their man for money

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:33.321
they're depending on their man for love, trust, loyalty

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:34.881
They’re not with their man for money

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:37.081
they might even make more money than their man

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:39.321
and they're still doing all the household chores

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.641
and satisfying their partners needs

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:43.461
because they like to 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.120
basically they get enjoyment out of life by taking care of their partner

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:50.521
these women are pretty rare but you do see them running around

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:51.881
they’re the happiest women out there

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:53.401
No, we're not in the 50s anymore

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:54.681
the year is 2024

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:57.661
but these women are still taking the ideology

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.280
that they should take care of their man

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.281
take care of their house

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:01.441
 take care of themselves

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:03.401
They basically are just thriving in life

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:04.686
I don't know what do you guys think
