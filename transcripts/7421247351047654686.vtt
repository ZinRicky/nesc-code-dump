00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
To say that JD Vance and Tim Waltz agreed

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.520
that a woman should have died seeking an abortion in Georgia,

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.961
but that they just disagreed about what killed her,

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:13.921
when JD Vance's entire ideology

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:16.001
and all of the policies that underpin it

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.381
are single handed responsible for the laws that killed her,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.740
is preposterous.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.200
The idea that better child care policies and better parental leave,

00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:26.681
you know, things that Republicans are so known for fighting for,

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:28.621
would have been able to save her is.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.240
Is so offensive. Is.

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:34.481
It still assumes that JD Vance knows better what you should do

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:36.081
then you do. No,

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:36.801
you don't agree.

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:42.381
And to feign empathy for a woman who died because of your policy

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.037
is not civil, it's manipulative.
