00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
I was laying in bed about to go to sleep,

00:02.241 --> 00:05.081
and all I kept thinking about was this sweet,

00:05.082 --> 00:08.421
comforting dessert I used to have growing up called mishrice.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.700
Growing up, my German grandma would make this for me all the time.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.900
Essentially, it's just a rice pudding.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.880
I started by sweating down my rice and some butter,

00:16.881 --> 00:19.121
took it off the heat, poured in some milk,

00:19.122 --> 00:21.601
pinch of salt, some sugar and vanilla,

00:21.602 --> 00:25.401
let that come to a boil, and then simmer for about 35 minutes.

00:25.402 --> 00:26.121
In the meantime,

00:26.122 --> 00:29.821
I made a quick raspberry compote with some frozen raspberries,

00:29.920 --> 00:32.260
squeeze of lemon, and some sugar.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.040
After it simmered for a few minutes,

00:34.041 --> 00:37.001
I gradually added in my cornstarch slurry,

00:37.002 --> 00:38.441
and once it was thick enough,

00:38.442 --> 00:40.481
I let it simmer for a couple more minutes

00:40.482 --> 00:42.201
before taking it off the heat.

00:42.202 --> 00:44.001
One thing that's just an essential

00:44.002 --> 00:46.461
is cinnamon sugar on top of mesh rice.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.840
So I combined some cinnamon and sugar,

00:48.841 --> 00:51.501
plated my rice, sprinkled that on top,

00:51.560 --> 00:54.760
and then finished it off with some of my raspberry sauce.

00:54.761 --> 00:57.481
I like eating this while it's still piping hot.

00:57.482 --> 01:01.418
This was absolutely heavenly and exactly what I needed to go to sleep.
