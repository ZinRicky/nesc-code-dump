00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.120
nothing worse than being a woman in this business

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:04.161
I sometimes wish I was African American

00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:04.881
you know okay

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:08.841
so in feminist scholarship there's this idea that oppressions are not ranked

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:09.601
they're linked

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:11.641
which is the idea that you can't really say that like

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:14.401
sexism is worse than racism or racism is worse than sexism

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:15.481
that they're all connected

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.721
many black feminist scholars will say that their blackness right

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:21.441
their experience of racism is actually the the

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:24.601
the hardest part of their experience more than their womenness

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:25.281
this because they

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:26.681
they don't just experience racism

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:28.481
they experience a modified

00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:30.401
more pernicious uh

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:31.281
version of racism

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:33.321
which is modified by the sexism that they experience

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:35.201
this comment doesn't just omit the

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:37.041
you know existence of black women um

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:39.261
it also makes Assumption that somehow

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.960
the experience of black women is easier than the experience of white women

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:45.401
which is well documentedly not true

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:49.121
what sort of that said is that she wants to be an African American man

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:51.881
which is unfortunately how a lot of white women come into feminism

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:54.101
wanna be men they want power

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.494
not freedom want an individual emancipation and not a collective one
