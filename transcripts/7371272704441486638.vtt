00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.880
Ice cream is a super food if done correctly,

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:05.961
and it's the sort of food that I will only make from scratch

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:08.121
because it requires nutrient dense ingredients

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:09.121
straight from the source.

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:12.721
Three raw egg yolks from my backyard chicken raised on pasture,

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:13.921
3 cups of raw cream,

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:16.601
and a touch of maple sugar and vanilla is all it takes

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.561
and I whisk this up in just a few minutes.

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:21.281
I carefully pour this into a frozen ice cream bowl

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:23.001
that churns for about 20 minutes

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.141
until the cream has turned into ice cream.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.000
It's delicious and soft at this point,

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.081
but I want my husband to be able to enjoy it too,

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:31.221
so I put it in the freezer to firm up

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.200
while I make my chocolate chip cookie dough.

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:35.521
I start by freshly milling my primitive,

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:36.841
regeneratively grown wheat berries

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.521
so I have a truly whole wheat flour,

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:39.721
which lowers the glycemic

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:42.221
load and rate at which carbohydrates are absorbed

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.080
to a more gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream.

00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:47.601
This cookie dough is slightly sweetened with 4

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:49.521
tablespoons of low glycemic coconut sugar

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:51.641
and I add a few good ingredient chocolate chunks

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:52.961
that I first coarsely chop

00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:54.921
before kneading with my hands into the dough.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.921
Next, I make small little balls of cookie

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:59.801
and line a baking sheet with unbleached Parchment paper

00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:01.721
so that I can first freeze the cookie dough.

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:04.281
This prevents it from sticking when storing in the freezer.

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:07.321
Finally, I remove my homemade vanilla Ice cream from the freezer

00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:11.101
and let it soften up for about 25 minutes before scooping into it.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.560
Homemade ice cream doesn't have gums,

00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:13.761
thickeners, and stabilizers,

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:15.281
so this is an important step.

00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:17.121
The cookie dough is the final edition.

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:19.481
This was literally my favorite ice cream growing up,

00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:22.241
so to be able to make it in a super food way for my family

00:01:22.242 --> 00:01:23.561
is truly a blessing.

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:24.981
Oh, it's so mouth watering
