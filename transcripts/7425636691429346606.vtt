00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.840
Back when I first started learning how to cook,

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:04.001
the. One of the first things I Learned how to cook correctly

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:05.241
was a roast chicken.

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:08.201
This is such a simple but useful skill to learn in the kitchen.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:11.401
Chicken is so versatile. You can use this as a meal in itself,

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:13.481
or break it down to cook many other meals,

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:15.261
and then make some broth afterwards,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.200
which then can be used to make soups,

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:18.901
gravies, and so much more.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.760
We're gonna start with our chicken here

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.281
that I process myself. Now,

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:23.761
if you do process your own chicken,

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:26.801
make sure that the chicken rest in brine for a few hours.

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:28.201
And don't cook it to the next day.

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:29.601
You need to give it at least,

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:31.921
you know, six to 12 hours to pass rigor mortis.

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:33.321
If the chickens in rigor mortis

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:34.981
when you cook it, it's gonna be tough.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.360
Then gonna salt the whole carcass,

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.641
even inside. You can also put a lemon inside.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.201
I think this slows down the cooking time,

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:42.201
so I prefer not to do that.

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:43.641
I season my butter and it's.

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.941
And liberally coat the whole chicken in butter.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.160
I have salt, pepper,

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:48.441
garlic, and thyme.

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:51.201
I did put some thyme inside the carcass as well.

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:52.441
With any chicken or Turkey,

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:53.961
if you stuff the inside of the carcass,

00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:55.981
it's gonna slow down the cooking time.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.640
Now, I roasted this chicken at 3 seventy five

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:01.521
for about an hour and 15 minutes.

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:03.801
I continue to check Depending on the weight of your bird,

00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:05.541
you really need to check the temperature.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.240
I use a digital thermometer.

00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:09.761
The internal temperature needs to reach 1 sixty five.

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:11.721
So I'll pull the chicken out at 1:60.

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:14.281
Because it will continue to cook for a few minutes

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:16.681
and rise in temperature once you pull it out.

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:17.881
If you go over this temperature,

00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:19.861
it's gonna start to dry the chicken out.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.960
Now, I'm not handling this right out the oven.

00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.161
I let the chicken rest for about 30 minutes

00:01:24.162 --> 00:01:25.721
and cool down where I can handle it

00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:27.501
and dismantle the chicken correctly.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.360
This also lets the chicken trap in those juices and not to dry out.

00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:32.441
And it doesn't burn your hands.

00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:35.861
It's a lot easier to take the chicken apart when it's not piping hot.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.360
Now I get to enjoy this beautifully roasted chicken.

00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.601
And I can use the carcass to boil down

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:44.021
and make some broth for soups and stews.
