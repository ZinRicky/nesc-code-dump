00:00.680 --> 00:02.440
Okay, get your apron on,

00:02.441 --> 00:04.021
and let's make some yogurt.

00:04.480 --> 00:08.160
I'm gonna grab a couple of gallons of my raw milk here

00:08.161 --> 00:09.941
from our cows here on the farm.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.800
I'm going to pour it into my instant pot here.

00:12.801 --> 00:16.681
And what you're doing here is getting the milk to 180 degrees.

00:16.682 --> 00:19.421
That's going to help break up the milk proteins

00:19.480 --> 00:22.720
and help your yogurt set up later on

00:22.721 --> 00:23.661
in the process.

00:24.680 --> 00:25.900
Drink some milk as you go.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.960
Here I am getting at the 1 80.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.701
Use your trusty thermometer.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.840
Once it gets to 180 degrees,

00:31.841 --> 00:36.141
we simply need to let it cool back down to 110 degrees.

00:36.320 --> 00:41.920
Now, I put it in these pans to add some cold water around,

00:41.921 --> 00:45.221
and I keep exchanging the cold water to go faster.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.200
You can just put in the fridge or wait,

00:47.201 --> 00:49.381
but it has to get to 110 degrees.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.740
Once it's 210 degrees, I'll take a little milk out,

00:52.760 --> 00:56.480
or I will pour a half a cup of just plain yogurt in it.

00:56.481 --> 01:01.101
I'll mix it in, and then I'll dump that back into my main pot.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.420
At this point, the yogurt is ready to be incubated.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.520
I do that on my instant pot because it has a yogurt setting,

01:07.521 --> 01:10.361
which keeps it at 110 degrees for eight hours.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.321
And then at the end of eight hours,

01:12.322 --> 01:14.521
you have this. It is amazing.

01:14.522 --> 01:16.981
It's easy, it's delicious,

01:17.400 --> 01:20.540
and everyone in the family is gonna love it.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.500
Homemade yogurt, you'll never stop.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.580
Cheers.
