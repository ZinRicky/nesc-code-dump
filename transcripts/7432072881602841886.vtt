00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
I definitely feel like it's true to size.

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:04.121
I wear a large. I ordered a large.

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:05.921
It fits me with all the same amount of room.

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.801
I always have the arms come down pretty long.

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:10.161
Long enough for me. I'm tall,

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:11.641
and usually things will be a little short.

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:14.001
But it works. I love this thing so much.

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.601
It's just so cute. It can go over anything.

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.041
And I just love that these three buttons

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:19.921
and the way that this little detail is here,

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:21.481
it makes it look like it's a pullover.

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:23.461
I don't know why. That makes it feel fancier,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.740
but it's not. It's like the ease of a little jacket,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.800
but it's not heavy like a jacket.

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:32.630
It's a little jacket. I love it. It's linked right here.
