00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.240
I recently been experiencing a lot of,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.600
like, good anxiety.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.520
Like, good things happening,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.600
and then it gives me that anxiety feeling like,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.160
oh, my god, oh,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.920
my god, oh, my god.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.960
But it's for good reason.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.460
But then I feel like my body

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.120
can't tell the difference between good anxiety or,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.960
like, you know,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.300
the bad anxiety.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.000
And so then, you know,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.120
usually after anxiety comes depression.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.060
And so then,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.720
even though it's been,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.360
like, really,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.220
really good things happening and I'm excited about shit,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.360
I still have days that I'm, like,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.000
waking up crying and, like,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.480
having such a hard time with everything,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.360
like, all my feelings,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.280
because it's like my body thinks,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.760
like, oh, well,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.780
you're just anxious.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.240
So now let's balance you out

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.840
and make you feel a little bit depressed.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.640
And it's like,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.880
it was good.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.140
There's nothing to be sad about.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.220
And that's a journey I'm exploring.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.420
Thank you for listening.
