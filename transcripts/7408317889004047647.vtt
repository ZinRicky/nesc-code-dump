If you wanna know how the tratt wife life typically ends,

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:05.841
we could just look at the Plathville,

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:06.961
if you don't know. What's that show?

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:10.481
Welcome to Plathville. This is basically ballerina farms,

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:13.981
but 25 years in the. In the future.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And what happens? Even though the woman

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.881
that whole agreement was. For 24 years they were married,

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:21.641
she was the one staying home with the kids.

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:24.021
She was the main caretaker,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.560
the main parent, the default parent,

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:29.881
the one who they went to for everything while he was away at work.

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:31.821
When they divorced, what does he ask for?

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.840
He asks for full custody and child support and alimony.

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:39.121
So you enter a marriage where the arrangement is,

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:40.721
I'm gonna take care of the kids,

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:42.361
you're gonna work and provide for the family.

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:43.841
But then when that marriage ends now,

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:46.321
you're gonna turn around and wanna take the kids

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:48.041
and then ask me for money.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:50.681
How the fuck? With what fucking job experience?

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:52.401
With what? With what? Anything?

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:54.901
All you've been doing is being barefoot and pregnant.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.820
But that's how the Chad wife life ends.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.560
Whether it's because he cheated on you and he left you,

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.521
or because you finally fucking wake up like most women do,

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:04.401
and realize, wow,

00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:06.641
this is really sucks. This is really fucking miserable.

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:09.261
I love my kids, but this shit is not fun.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.320
One way or another, the child wife life ends.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.761
And what's gonna happen in the end?

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:15.521
All the. Everything that You poured into that family.

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:18.161
Look at how the husband is gonna treat you in the end.

00:01:18.162 --> 00:01:20.983
So think about that before you wanna jump in.
