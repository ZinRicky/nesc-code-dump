00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.680
so as we go into the New Year and some of you are gonna be like oh my god

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:04.161
my relationship is the one thing I'm gonna work on

00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:06.501
I'm gonna make sure that we go to therapy and we get everything right

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.560
um hear me loud and hear me clear when I say

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:10.641
a lot of times uh

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:15.201
narcissist will use the therapy to fuck with you even worse

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:19.241
they know how to put on a mask and put on a show for the therapist

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:23.041
and then they'll get the therapist involved in kinda making you the problem

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:25.001
and you just feel even fucking crazier

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:29.041
so before you go jumping into some couples counselling and shit

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:29.841
trying to work on shit

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.581
start some individual therapy

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.780
make sure you got your shit unlocked

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.040
make sure you know who the fuck you are

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:38.141
what the fuck you got going on

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.400
do you know what I mean

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:42.081
before you go to some couples counselling

00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:44.941
where Homeboy is gonna be on his best behaviour to begin with

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.560
playing up a show for the therapist who's meeting all of you for the first time

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:51.441
so they're making their impressions and they're gonna go along with this like

00:00:51.442 --> 00:00:52.321
I mean I don't know

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:55.561
like you only see a therapist for 30

00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:58.021
45 maybe 60 minutes a week

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.680
it's real easy to put on a show

00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:03.901
and it's real easy for them to be pushing your buttons

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.760
leading up to those appointments

00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:07.121
so that when you get there

00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:08.521
you're a little bit on edge

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:10.081
and you're not able to think clearly

00:01:10.082 --> 00:01:11.001
speak clearly and

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:12.941
and express yourself correctly

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.160
and they're nice and fucking cool

00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:16.001
calm and collected

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:17.781
and they got that mask on tight

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.560
so before you start some couples counseling

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:22.001
cause you're gonna work on your relationship this year

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:23.161
work on yourself first

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:24.601
work on yourself first

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:26.201
work on yourself first

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:28.581
a building is made above of bricks

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.240
individual bricks that what

00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:32.741
that's what makes the whole fucking building right

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.120
you are one brick in the building that is your relationship

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:39.441
so make sure that foundation is solid

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:41.761
and that foundation is you

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:47.881
make sure your salad don't get mine fucked in some bullshit and

00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:50.141
and get this year off on some crazy shit

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.680
you wanna work on that relationship that starts with you

00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.441
you are half of that relationship

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:55.681
get your shit straight

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.439
and then you could go to some couples counseling
