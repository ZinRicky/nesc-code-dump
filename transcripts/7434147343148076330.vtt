hey guys

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:03.800
I'm a marine contractor in the beautiful state of Florida

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:06.960
so we have a lot of clients that have one or multiple boats

00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:08.860
so I saw this product here

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.920
a little boat eraser uh

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:14.040
removes marks off of your vinyl fiberglass

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:14.880
plastic wood

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.560
glass premium boat care

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:18.200
it's a microsberber uh

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:19.680
you just wet it down scrub it down

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.340
and it comes right off looks a little something like this

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.980
it's a pretty neat product

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.960
you just wet scrub

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:28.360
and you can reuse this until it literally falls apart

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.060
and it comes in a pack of three so check it out
