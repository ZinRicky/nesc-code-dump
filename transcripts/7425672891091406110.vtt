00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
But this is something that women and mothers do all the time.

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:04.121
It's the same thing as, like,

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:06.561
oh, I gave birth vaginally,

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:08.321
not C section. I'm a real mom.

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:09.961
You're not. You didn't really get first

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:11.641
that fucking bullshit ass argument

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:14.581
that's just there to try to divide and split women.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.760
Um, the next argument that we all have,

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.781
breastfeed or bottle? Oh,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800
you didn't breastfeed your children?

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:23.981
Breast is best. What do you mean? You gave them four,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.420
as if that fucking matters.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.520
Um, and then the next,

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:30.281
you know, the next,

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:31.161
every debate. Like,

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:33.561
it feels like every decision in motherhood

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:37.521
is just an opportunity for women to tear each other apart,

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:40.521
you know what I mean? When you're dealing with the wrong kind of women,

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:42.701
the women who still don't understand

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.340
that we need to fucking stick together

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.600
is that same pick me girl spirit

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:48.961
when we're little girls and like,

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:50.441
oh, I'm prettier,

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:51.861
he picked me, I'm skinnier.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.160
Um, and I. Yeah,

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:55.441
I just think it's really shitty.

00:00:55.442 --> 00:01:00.841
I, I don't wanna be in a relationship where someone is their stepfather

00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:02.361
and I'm giving all this authority to them.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:03.521
My kids have been through enough.

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:06.401
But I just didn't wanna put my romantic life on pause

00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:09.761
because I had children. So the way for me to balance that was to, like,

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:11.281
just kind of have a little village.

00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:13.421
Like, he's my boyfriend and they're my kids,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.240
and we all cohabitate and live together,

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.241
but he Doesn't really help me a ton.

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:19.021
And that's how I want it.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.700
That's how we are all comfortable.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.560
And, yeah,

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:23.241
I think to say, oh,

00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:25.541
you're not a single mom is, um,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.620
really shitty, so. And really untrue.
