00:00.080 --> 00:03.140
So one of the most common questions I get asked

00:03.160 --> 00:05.560
is my advice to high school girls

00:05.560 --> 00:08.660
who want to be traditional wives in the future.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.160
So first of all,

00:10.160 --> 00:14.620
you may or may not be super supported in this idea,

00:14.880 --> 00:16.260
and that is okay

00:16.640 --> 00:17.560
coming from me.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.440
I was not super supported in my decision

00:20.440 --> 00:23.500
to drop out of college and become a traditional wife.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.840
But I will tell you this,

00:24.840 --> 00:27.200
your family members and your friends

00:27.200 --> 00:28.480
usually come around,

00:28.480 --> 00:29.580
and if they don't,

00:29.880 --> 00:30.940
that's okay.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.300
You are supposed to be happy in life,

00:33.440 --> 00:37.460
and being happy is gonna look different for everybody.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.940
To go to college or not is a personal decision.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.620
So think wisely about what you really want to do.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.600
Don't feel pressured to go to college.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.860
Don't feel pressured not to go to college.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.840
It's okay to take a gap year.

00:50.840 --> 00:51.960
Take a step back.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.980
You just graduated high school.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.280
You've probably been in public school your entire life,

00:57.280 --> 00:58.660
since you were five.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.580
And it's okay to just

01:00.680 --> 01:03.420
take a breather and figure out what you want to do.

01:03.720 --> 01:06.280
Personally, I was homeschooled in high school.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.960
And after I was done with high school,

01:07.960 --> 01:09.380
I took a gap year

01:09.600 --> 01:13.660
and I got a part time job at a supplement store.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.400
And that is where I Learned a lot about nutrition

01:16.400 --> 01:17.280
and supplements.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.060
And I had a lot of fun with it.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.600
And then I went to college.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.340
I went to community college a year later.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.800
I highly recommend community college.

01:25.800 --> 01:29.120
I would recommend that over university any day,

01:29.120 --> 01:31.780
especially because your first two years

01:31.960 --> 01:33.160
are very important

01:33.160 --> 01:35.480
and you don't want to go back and forth

01:35.480 --> 01:37.500
when it comes to changing your major.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.040
When you go to a university,

01:39.040 --> 01:41.260
you have to pick a particular major,

01:41.400 --> 01:43.920
whereas in community college

01:43.920 --> 01:46.640
you have more broad majors to choose from,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.120
so it's a lot less stress

01:48.120 --> 01:52.180
when it comes to picking your courses and your major.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.120
Community college also gives you

01:54.120 --> 01:57.060
the chance to stay home with your family,

01:57.080 --> 01:58.440
which I think is so important.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.960
If you have a very loving,

01:59.960 --> 02:03.640
supporting family that wants the best for you,

02:03.640 --> 02:04.680
stay at home.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.960
I don't know what this whole rush is to

02:06.960 --> 02:08.380
to get out of home.

02:08.440 --> 02:09.320
And you know,

02:09.320 --> 02:11.100
you see 18 year old girls

02:11.320 --> 02:12.800
getting apartments together

02:12.800 --> 02:14.000
and working full time

02:14.000 --> 02:15.740
just to pay for those apartments

02:16.000 --> 02:16.840
and it's silly.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.480
If you don't need to leave the home,

02:18.480 --> 02:19.940
then don't leave your home.

02:19.960 --> 02:20.840
On a serious note,

02:20.840 --> 02:23.560
that is my number one tip

02:23.560 --> 02:25.880
for young girls wanting to be traditional wives.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.560
Do not leave home

02:27.560 --> 02:29.440
unless you absolutely need to

02:29.440 --> 02:31.820
or you don't have a healthy dynamic at home.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.500
Stay home as long as you possibly can.

02:34.760 --> 02:37.940
Contribute around the house, do chores.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.480
Contributing around the house

02:39.480 --> 02:42.020
also will teach you home making skills.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.340
Learn to cook.

02:43.720 --> 02:46.560
Practice recipes in your family's kitchen

02:46.560 --> 02:49.280
and feed your family delicious food

02:49.280 --> 02:51.300
and new recipes you've tried.

02:51.640 --> 02:52.520
Clean the House,

02:52.520 --> 02:55.000
help your mom out if you can

02:55.000 --> 02:57.860
and learn different cleaning techniques

02:57.960 --> 03:01.040
if you would like to get a part time job.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.580
This is so much fun to experiment.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.240
And usually

03:04.240 --> 03:07.540
these part time jobs are nothing super serious,

03:07.640 --> 03:10.120
they're just to get you out in the world

03:10.120 --> 03:11.240
in the working world

03:11.240 --> 03:13.060
and give you some experience,

03:13.120 --> 03:13.880
especially like

03:13.880 --> 03:16.440
customer service experience. Again,

03:16.440 --> 03:18.300
I worked at a supplement store

03:18.360 --> 03:20.280
and I was homeschooled for high school,

03:20.280 --> 03:23.140
so I became really shy and introverted.

03:23.560 --> 03:26.280
And I think getting into that supplement store

03:26.280 --> 03:28.280
and learning customer service skills

03:28.280 --> 03:29.800
and learning how to speak to people

03:29.800 --> 03:30.520
and help people

03:30.520 --> 03:31.760
really helped me

03:31.760 --> 03:34.920
because in the beginning it was.

03:34.920 --> 03:35.600
It was hard.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.480
Like I would just laugh awkwardly

03:37.480 --> 03:38.980
when I didn't know what to do.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.280
And I think

03:40.280 --> 03:42.280
the longer I worked at that store,

03:42.280 --> 03:45.840
the better I became at communicating with people.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.940
One of the biggest pros to staying home,

03:49.200 --> 03:50.600
having a part time job

03:50.600 --> 03:52.700
or going to community college

03:52.800 --> 03:54.040
is that you

03:54.040 --> 03:56.920
kind of still get to be like a kid and.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.540
And to feel like a kid.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.720
You're dependent on your family

04:00.720 --> 04:02.800
and you're still safe at home,

04:02.800 --> 04:04.320
but you're able to

04:04.320 --> 04:07.080
take that next step into the big world,

04:07.080 --> 04:08.760
which is getting a job

04:08.760 --> 04:11.160
and just having that experience

04:11.160 --> 04:13.220
and being able to spend money.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.100
You learn to spend money a little bit more wisely

04:16.160 --> 04:18.280
and you learn how to save up for things

04:18.280 --> 04:19.780
rather than just

04:20.000 --> 04:21.160
asking your Mom or dad

04:21.160 --> 04:22.320
for money to get things,

04:22.320 --> 04:23.420
you have to learn.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.640
Okay, well, this paycheck,

04:24.640 --> 04:25.480
I can get this,

04:25.480 --> 04:26.280
and then maybe

04:26.280 --> 04:26.960
the next paycheck,

04:26.960 --> 04:27.920
I can get that.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.180
I want to add,

04:29.400 --> 04:31.860
you don't need to go to college.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.800
You shouldn't feel pressured to.

04:33.800 --> 04:37.060
If you want to be a traditional wife in the future,

04:37.240 --> 04:39.100
you don't need to go to college.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.620
This narrative that

04:41.920 --> 04:43.360
women who don't go to college

04:43.360 --> 04:44.400
or people in general

04:44.400 --> 04:45.240
who don't go to college

04:45.240 --> 04:46.280
are uneducated

04:46.280 --> 04:47.700
is so false.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.560
We have the internet,

04:49.560 --> 04:50.440
we have books.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.380
We have so many resources

04:52.720 --> 04:53.840
at our fingertips.

04:53.840 --> 04:54.920
You don't need

04:54.920 --> 04:57.020
to go to college to get educated.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.560
In fact, you will save yourself so much money

04:59.560 --> 05:01.180
if you do decide

05:01.200 --> 05:02.320
not to go to college

05:02.320 --> 05:04.360
or if you just go to community college

05:04.360 --> 05:05.620
for your associates.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.160
Other tip is to get involved in something

05:08.160 --> 05:09.260
extracurricular

05:09.360 --> 05:11.180
if you want to be a traditional wife.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.760
Part of being a traditional wife

05:12.760 --> 05:14.720
is that you are serving your family,

05:14.720 --> 05:16.220
and you are serving others

05:16.360 --> 05:17.240
that you love.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.040
And a great way to practice this

05:19.040 --> 05:21.120
is to get involved in something

05:21.120 --> 05:22.320
that doesn't pay you.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.960
So volunteering

05:23.960 --> 05:25.960
so you can get involved in

05:25.960 --> 05:27.260
your local church,

05:27.600 --> 05:28.360
the church that maybe

05:28.360 --> 05:29.940
you've grown up going to,

05:29.960 --> 05:32.220
and you can help with the children center.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.080
This is a great way to get

05:34.080 --> 05:36.360
also to get involved with children

05:36.360 --> 05:38.300
and learn how to care for them.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.200
So those are just some tips.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.500
For younger girls

05:41.600 --> 05:44.300
who want to be traditional wives in the future,

05:44.560 --> 05:47.000
remember, the best tip I can give you

05:47.000 --> 05:49.520
is to involve yourself in things

05:49.520 --> 05:50.840
that are going to better

05:50.840 --> 05:51.800
you as a wife

05:51.800 --> 05:52.360
and a mother

05:52.360 --> 05:53.460
in the future

05:53.800 --> 05:55.800
and better you as a homemaker

05:55.800 --> 05:57.160
in general. So

05:57.160 --> 05:59.200
I hope these tips helped you guys,

05:59.200 --> 06:01.160
and best of luck to you

06:01.160 --> 06:02.020
younger ladies.
