00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.320
So I'm sitting here

00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:04.321
starting to wrap gifts for my kids for the holiday season,

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:05.801
because I like to be on top of it,

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:09.361
and because we're probably gonna be traveling soon,

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:10.481
and we have guests coming in, and, like,

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:11.801
I just wanna get it done. Okay.

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:13.841
We also do Christmas, Hanukkah,

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:17.061
and then I have. My third child's birthday is on the 27th.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.120
And this is kind of a question for people who have December babies,

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.781
but especially holiday area babies.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.160
This is the first year that he knows,

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:27.161
I guess, what his birthday is.

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:28.241
He's turning three,

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:34.501
and I think we could get away without doing a big party this year.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.800
But I wanna know how people

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:40.141
in the past, people with December birthdays or December babies

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.760
have made it really special for them.

00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:45.681
And I understand, like,

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:48.081
this year is a complete chaos

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:50.721
because Hanukkah starts on Christmas,

00:00:50.722 --> 00:00:54.841
so that means there will be Hanukkah on his birthday no matter what.

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:56.961
And I have a feeling that'll happen again in his lifetime

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:58.821
because Hanukkah changes every year.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.760
But considering Hanukkah is gonna be on his birthday,

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.841
sometimes on his birthday this year,

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:06.381
Christmas is two days before,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.680
how can I still make his birthday like,

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:13.001
a big deal? Because we.

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:16.041
We tend to do pretty big birthdays in our house.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:19.041
Not huge, but we definitely love celebrating.

00:01:19.042 --> 00:01:21.281
We take any excuse to celebrate.

00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:23.221
And before anyone asks, yes,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.860
we have birthday wrapping paper for the birthday presents.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.538
I do know that that's a big deal
