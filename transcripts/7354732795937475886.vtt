00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.400
I'm having my breakfast

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:04.120
but I wanted to talk about something as a homeschool parent

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:09.320
that I think really helped me make the switch from doing public school to doing

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:11.860
um like private home education

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.240
before starting this video

00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:15.280
I would like to acknowledge and admit

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:19.080
that being able to homeschool your children is a privilege um

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:20.640
and especially a financial privilege

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:24.320
it is a privilege of time and resources that a lot of people do not have

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:28.540
and public education is an absolute cornerstone to a free thinking society

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.100
and I do not think public education should go anywhere

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.240
what I do think however

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.480
is that public education needs an update

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:36.000
the system needs to be updated

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.120
it hasn't been updated in decades

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:42.760
and honestly our public education system could be so much better

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:44.900
but we all know the powers that we don't wanna do that

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.320
anyway back to homeschooling

00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:50.240
my older kids went to a Reggio Amelia program for preschool and pre K

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:53.620
and my youngest who's two right now currently goes to a Reggio program

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.720
and there is so much science behind child LED

00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:59.920
collaborative learning that breeds creative thinking

00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:01.440
it breeds problem solving

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.360
it breeds collaboration

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.040
and it instills a love of learning

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:10.400
because it is so much more child centered than it is curriculum structured

00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:12.520
now if we're looking at the class economics of this

00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:16.080
these are always private programs and expensive

00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.120
there's a whole discussion to be had about why

00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.660
the best forms of learning are kept for

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.500
the socioeconomical elite

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.520
it's not hard to figure out

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:28.460
so when I started thinking about homeschooling my older kids

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.760
one of the biggest benefits I saw to it

00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:32.920
was having a much more child LED approach

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:34.360
fostering their love of learning

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:39.180
through allowing them to deep dive into things that they are interested in

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.000
while still contributing to their education in the core required step subjects

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.740
you know I'm not an unschooler per se

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.160
we have curriculum that we use

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:53.360
but I absolutely want my kids to be excited and engaged

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:55.760
and passionate about all the different subjects that we're learning

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:57.060
because in my opinion

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.480
sitting through the motions

00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:03.120
going through your classes doesn't actually breathe learning at all

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.040
how many of us stared off into space

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.460
or zoned our teacher out because we were not engaged with the subject matter

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.760
so when people say that homeschooling is a good option

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:17.920
I agree I think homeschooling fills the gap that we have in our education system

00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:23.080
to allow for child LED and child engaged learning

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:27.240
however I believe that that should be accessible for all children

00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:29.260
who would benefit from learning that way

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.500
and I don't think it would be impossible

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.160
for the American education system to adopt a Reggio Amelia

00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:39.340
or even a montessori type method of education

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.100
but they won't because it leads to kids asking too many questions
