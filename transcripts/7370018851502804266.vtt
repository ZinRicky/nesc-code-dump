00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.580
the bullying is so bad it's so bad

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.560
this is why we can't have nice things

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.840
this is why more people aren't speaking up

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:12.980
because y'all take someone supporting a cause

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.300
to help children in a war torn country

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.140
and you make it about not supporting kids on the other side of the border

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.500
and I've gotten it too

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.600
and I knew I would

00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:26.760
as soon as I started working for a crowdsourcing for Gofundme

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.160
for a Palestinian family

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.680
I knew people would say I didn't care about Israeli kids

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:32.600
and the reality is maybe I'm just like

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:33.520
a little bit naive

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.600
but I've been very outspoken about being a Jewish woman

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:37.980
having family in Israel

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.080
like the given is that I care

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:41.800
and I will post more stuff

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:43.280
but the humanitarian crisis

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:44.200
the lack of water

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:44.920
the lack of shelter

00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:45.840
the lack of food

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:48.960
means that more people are gonna be giving attention to Gaza right now

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:53.840
and the bullying of people who speak out for the civilians on either side

00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:56.920
either the hostages or the Gotham children

00:00:56.921 --> 00:00:59.134
is insane no civilians deserve
