00:00.080 --> 00:01.120
Come on. Hey,

00:01.120 --> 00:02.480
talk to me. Of course,

00:02.480 --> 00:03.560
but only for a minute.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.900
Then I have to get to work on this pigsty.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.220
Coffee? No, no coffee.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.040
Bobby. Bobby.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.760
Last night I went online, alright?

00:10.760 --> 00:11.900
And I found out

00:12.120 --> 00:14.120
all of the women here that used to be big deals.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.160
I mean, big deals. CEOs,

00:16.160 --> 00:17.800
executives, judges.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.720
Sarah Sunderson,

00:18.720 --> 00:22.820
she used to run an airline with that perfect skin.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.760
No, no, no. She didn't used to look like that.

00:25.760 --> 00:26.560
None of the women did.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.760
They copy? No,

00:27.760 --> 00:30.940
no coffee. Bobby,

00:33.280 --> 00:34.540
this is you.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.220
That's right, Joanna.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.740
This isn't me.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.020
It's a whole new me.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.880
I'm happy and I'm healthy.

00:42.880 --> 00:46.460
Because I understand what's important in life. Yes,

00:46.600 --> 00:47.360
your new book.

00:47.360 --> 00:47.960
That's right.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.000
That's what's important.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.240
My new cookbook.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.420
And my husband and my family are making a perfect home.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.300
It's a lesson every gal needs to learn.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.520
Especially you.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.300
I'm your friend, Joanna.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.080
I'm going to help you.

01:01.080 --> 01:01.800
You need me.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.960
You stay away from me.

01:02.960 --> 01:03.860
You're driven.

01:04.240 --> 01:05.120
Well, sometimes.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.340
And you're selfish.

01:06.960 --> 01:08.980
You wanna rule the world? No.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.880
I can fix you.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.740
I can change you.

01:13.120 --> 01:17.940
What have they done to you
