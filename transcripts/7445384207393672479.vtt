00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.840
On top of being dragged through the family court system

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:07.541
for no fucking reason other than I wanted to be free.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.720
Um, I also had my last roommate vandalize my car and destroyed it.

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:15.921
And then I haven't had a car since

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:20.621
because my insurance didn't cover the whole thing. So

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.220
thankfully,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.560
whatever. That's a whole another fucking story.

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.841
But the point is, I'm now a single mother to four kids.

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:29.881
One of them is disabled. She's a fucking wish kid.

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:32.781
And I have no car in Colorado,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.240
and I'm hocking shit on the TikTok shop to try to make enough money.

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:39.041
So since my car got broken into,

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:42.601
I did get cameras, but the one that we have in the front is not like

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:44.201
a doorbell kind of camera.

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:46.661
So I got this one off the TikTok shop.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.240
If you just click on the link,

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:50.801
that would be super helpful too,

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:51.801
cause then it pushes it

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:55.101
and maybe somebody who wants to to buy it will buy it.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.440
You can just watch for the free entertainment of tears on the internet.

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:01.401
But it also comes with the card.

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.381
Like, this is a really sweet deal.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.160
It's a dope. This one is the wired version,

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:09.421
so I'm gonna have to figure out how to do that.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.540
But the product itself is really dope.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.340
Um,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.180
I have to pay like $6,000.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.800
Ugh. Whatever.

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:27.741
Um, it's a really cool fucking thing.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.420
And it's linked right here.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.860
Okay. It's packaged really well.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.300
Um,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.540
So, yeah,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.700
whatever.
