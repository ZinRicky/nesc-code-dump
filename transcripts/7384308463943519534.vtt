Today we're making some Turkish eggs.

00:03.321 --> 00:06.681
So I started off by straining some of Daniel's homemade yogurt

00:06.682 --> 00:07.941
in a cheese cloth

00:08.200 --> 00:10.980
and hung that so it could get a bit thicker.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.500
Then I wash my butter.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.800
I also like to run it under some cold water

00:16.801 --> 00:18.601
to get it really nice and washed,

00:18.602 --> 00:20.421
and then I add some salts,

00:21.120 --> 00:25.120
and then we use that butter for our base.

00:25.121 --> 00:26.201
So we cook the butter,

00:26.202 --> 00:27.601
and when it was nice and bubbly,

00:27.602 --> 00:29.521
I added my cayenne flakes,

00:29.522 --> 00:31.301
smoked paprika, and cumin,

00:32.120 --> 00:33.880
and let that infuse together.

00:33.881 --> 00:35.161
It smelled so good.

00:35.162 --> 00:37.021
We made some sourdough bread,

00:37.200 --> 00:38.640
and while that was cooking,

00:38.641 --> 00:43.361
I made the jalapeno parsley, olive oil drizzle.

00:43.362 --> 00:45.501
So I smashed the jalapenos,

00:45.680 --> 00:47.040
chopped up the parsley,

00:47.041 --> 00:48.541
added them together,

00:48.880 --> 00:52.020
drizzled some olive oil and salt,

00:52.600 --> 00:57.480
and then the yogurt was a lot thicker by this point,

00:57.481 --> 01:02.621
so we added some salt and fresh garlic, and then pepper,

01:02.840 --> 01:05.860
some dill and mix that together.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.000
And then I got started on the poached eggs.

01:09.001 --> 01:11.841
So I put them in water and vinegar and let them sit for, like,

01:11.842 --> 01:12.861
10 minutes.

01:12.920 --> 01:16.260
And that really is the trick to having the perfect poached egg.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.200
And then we plated it.

01:18.201 --> 01:19.321
So we put garlic,

01:19.322 --> 01:21.281
the garlic yogurt on the bottom,

01:21.282 --> 01:26.161
we drizzled the jalapeno parsley on top of that,

01:26.162 --> 01:29.481
then the poached eggs, and then your cayenne butter on top of that,

01:29.482 --> 01:32.881
and then you just get your sourdough toast and eat it.

01:32.882 --> 01:34.801
It was literally The most delicious thing ever.

01:34.802 --> 01:37.061
And Daniel liked it too.
