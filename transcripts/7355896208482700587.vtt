00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.580
the thing that former fats that I will never understand

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.160
is how you can exist in a fat body

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.161
move to the world in a fat body

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:12.021
knowing and experiencing how difficult it is to be fat

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.500
and how cruel the world is to fat people

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.360
and instead of when you lose weight

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:18.901
and you are no longer feeling the effects of fatphobia

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.980
personally me

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.520
for me if I had ever lost weight and like

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:25.001
people start treating me better and like

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.481
I no longer was experiencing fatphobia

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:30.201
it would infuriate me on behalf of my old self

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:30.681
you know what I mean

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:34.481
like I cannot understand how you

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:36.581
in contrast are in that position

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.220
and rather than being upset at the way the world treated you

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.740
you are now contributing to the cruelty that you experienced

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.560
in this past version of your body

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.881
like that that to me is like something I just like

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:48.961
will never understand

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:49.761
and it's like

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920
I don't know if it means that like

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:55.681
you hated the past version of yourself or if you still hate yourself

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:56.601
or if just like

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:57.481
you are not a good person

00:00:57.482 --> 00:01:02.121
and you have always been waiting for this opportunity to exercise your like

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:03.041
dominance and like

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:04.321
casual cruelty on others

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:05.801
I don't really know what it means

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:06.761
but it will never

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:11.261
not disappoint me to see former fat people being some of the most fatphobic

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.660
I that is genuinely very disappointing to me
