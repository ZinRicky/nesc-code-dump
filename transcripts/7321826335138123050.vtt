00:00.080 --> 00:01.760
Here are some things that I meal prep

00:01.760 --> 00:03.600
to make my week a little easier.

00:03.600 --> 00:05.840
I had some ripe bananas that needed to be used,

00:05.840 --> 00:07.440
so the only right way to use them

00:07.440 --> 00:09.020
is making banana bread.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.240
This is a one bowl,

00:10.240 --> 00:11.480
super simple recipe,

00:11.480 --> 00:14.660
and it comes out perfectly moist every single time.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.120
I usually add some chocolate chips to it,

00:17.120 --> 00:18.240
but I didn't this time

00:18.240 --> 00:20.580
to make it a little bit more versatile.

00:20.800 --> 00:24.340
Then I got started on some whipped robus honey butter.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.920
This is so good on the banana bread,

00:26.920 --> 00:28.000
but even other things.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.880
So I added my robus to the melted butter and some honey

00:30.880 --> 00:33.940
and whipped it over ice until it got super creamy.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.400
Then I put it all in a little glass jar

00:37.400 --> 00:39.680
and put that away in the fridge.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.280
I've been loving carrot salad,

00:41.280 --> 00:44.040
so I decided to make a rainbow carrot salad

00:44.040 --> 00:45.560
because it stores really well

00:45.560 --> 00:47.400
and it can be put on anything.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.440
So I add some oil,

00:48.440 --> 00:49.620
vinegar, lemon,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.260
honey, some spices, cilantro,

00:52.600 --> 00:55.920
and I usually put this on toast with some cream cheese

00:55.920 --> 00:57.760
or even just on its own.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.500
It works in a lot of different ways.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.200
You guys know what time it is?

01:01.200 --> 01:04.000
As soon as you guys see me pull out those purple onions.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.700
We're pickling onions today.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.440
I slice them up really thin

01:07.440 --> 01:09.880
and then dissolve my sugar with some vinegar,

01:09.880 --> 01:11.060
salt, and water.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.160
Then I put all of that in a Mason jar,

01:13.160 --> 01:14.760
add some Pepper corn to it

01:14.760 --> 01:16.480
and put it away to rest.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.920
Today I decided to switch up my blueberry sauce

01:18.920 --> 01:20.240
to raspberry sauce.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.640
So I added my frozen raspberries to a pot

01:22.640 --> 01:24.580
with some coconut sugar and lemon.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.760
Let that reduce

01:25.760 --> 01:28.520
until it got to the thickness I wanted it to get.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.600
This is so good when it's warmed up

01:30.600 --> 01:32.120
on some vanilla ice cream.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.120
Last but not least,

01:33.120 --> 01:36.880
I wanted to just make a batch of chicken noodle soup.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.360
It comes in so handy!

01:38.360 --> 01:40.600
So I diced up all of my vegetables

01:40.600 --> 01:43.200
and then added them to the pot with some ginger,

01:43.200 --> 01:44.620
a lot of garlic

01:44.840 --> 01:46.600
and a sprinkle of turmeric.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.720
And half of this batch

01:47.720 --> 01:50.574
I popped in the freezer to thaw whenever I need.
