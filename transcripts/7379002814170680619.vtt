Do you have backyard chickens right now and have an abundance of eggs?

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:05.781
Here are five great recipes to help you use up those eggs.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.840
First up, this is a nice simple one.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.761
Poached eggs can be kind of hard to get the technique down,

00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:11.561
but swirl, swirl,

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:12.441
swirl and you'll get there.

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:13.881
Next up is pancakes.

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:18.081
This is a great way to use up a few eggs and these can be customised.

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:18.881
Use chocolate chips,

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:20.821
blueberries, whatever floats your boat.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.760
My kids love chocolate pancakes.

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:24.501
I like playing with maple syrup

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.820
and my baby loves the blueberry pancakes.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.520
And you can't be a classic scrambled egg.

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:31.081
This can get rid of 10 to 12 eggs

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:32.741
and have some full bellies in the house.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.800
Now, this one is one of my favourite.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.221
This is French crepes.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.200
I actually use a sourdough recipe for this.

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:39.601
It used eight eggs.

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:42.241
You can customize and finish crepes in any way you like.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.681
Here we use chocolate sauce and some powdered sugar.

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:46.241
Now, if you're feeling a little extra,

00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:48.661
you can make a Dutch baby pancake.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.880
I love a Dutch baby.

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:52.881
This also can be finished in any way.

00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:55.601
Here I'm using some raw whipped cream to top,

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:57.521
some powdered sugar and my favourite,

00:00:57.522 --> 00:00:58.501
maple syrup.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.240
Try out these recipes today and tell me which one is your favourite.

00:01:01.241 --> 00:01:02.941
Mine has to be the Dutch baby.
