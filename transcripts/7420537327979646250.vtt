00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.360
anyone else ever have a parent or mother

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:03.760
tell them that they cannot leave the house

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:04.920
unless they look presentable

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.240
my mom would literally stop me in my tracks and tell me

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.160
what are you doing change out of those sweats

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:10.600
brush your hair

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:13.720
so I grew up with the idea that you always had to look presentable

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:14.480
you don't have to you know

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.120
put on a ball gown but look presentable

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:19.200
and that is one of the greatest gifts my mom passed down to me

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.600
if you look presentable this will open so many doors for you

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:23.160
people be kinder to you more generous

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.240
I'm not saying that's all you should have going for you

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:26.480
but if you look presentable

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:29.160
Most people will wanna be your friend youâ€™ll probably get a promotion at work

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.360
your life will genuinely be way easier

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:32.400
so if your mom never taught you this

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:34.820
Before you leave the house make sure you look a little presentable
