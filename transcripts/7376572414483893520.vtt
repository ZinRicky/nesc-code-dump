00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.140
men are the problem men

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.340
men leave are men trash men or men

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.020
it's because men are afraid of being called the problem

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.120
but women are afraid men are gonna kill them

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:14.460
if you're genuinely afraid of being called the problem

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.900
you need to grow up and go into my comment section

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.120
cause if you think that that's bad

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:25.640
you should see what men say to me on a daily basis

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.980
when I talk about the fact that women are being killed by their partners

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.740
men in my comments say I hope you're next

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.680
men in the comments tell me the most vile and disgusting hateful

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:42.460
threatening violent things on a daily basis

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.900
but you guys are scared of being told that you're the problem

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.320
honestly like I'm embarrassed for you

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:51.740
women have a higher pain tolerance than men

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.560
and that is not just physical

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:55.560
we have a higher emotional pain tolerance

00:00:55.561 --> 00:01:00.280
you guys can't handle anything complaining because women have a platform now

00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:03.780
women have a voice and they're finally speaking their truth

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.700
and you can't handle it cause you were born into a world that says

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.840
you're never gonna hear the truth of who you are and what you are

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:12.160
you're just gonna be able to take take

00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:13.880
take and things have changed

00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:15.180
times have changed

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.900
and you can keep taking but you will be held accountable

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.400
well in his response

00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.060
which you should watch to the video

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.600
brings up the famous Margaret Atwood quote

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:27.840
which is men are afraid women will laugh at them

00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:30.300
women are afraid men will kill them

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.520
trust me I get it

00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:34.480
it's tough hearing that you're the problem all the time

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:37.300
and you know what it's uncomfortable

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.420
it is I know that

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.280
because I've also felt uncomfortable at being held accountable

00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:44.800
for the privileges that I possess

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:48.160
and I've learnt how to sit in that discomfort

00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:51.280
and truly reflect on the ways that I'm privileged

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:52.560
and the ways I can be better

00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:54.400
but I also know it's possible to do that

00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:56.080
and I don't see a lot of you trying

00:01:56.081 --> 00:02:00.420
listen to me when women voice our fears about men

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.060
it is not with the purpose of making men into the enemy

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.660
it is with the purpose of sharing our reality

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.400
maybe instead of scrolling scrolling

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:14.220
scrolling past in annoyance being that victim

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.300
maybe step into your manhood

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.840
think about are you actually a man

00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:22.160
are you actually an initiated man who can sit with what that means

00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:24.920
instead of feeling attacked and victimized

00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:26.320
maybe it's time to listen

00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:27.700
learn and reflect

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.180
reflect on the truth of the matter

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.140
reflect on why people are saying this about men

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.480
if you're taking it personally

00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:37.100
why you take it personally

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.060
it's not about you really

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.920
it's not about you on a personal level

00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:43.120
is it or is it cause

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.520
why are you taking personally cause

00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:50.300
here's the tea changing men's behaviour

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.480
which is what needs to happen

00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:55.160
whether or not you see yourself as the man who needs to change

00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:57.780
or not changing men's behaviour

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.900
it doesn't require defensiveness from you

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.720
it requires empathy and understanding

00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:10.078
world where women feel safer is gonna be a world where men feel safer too
