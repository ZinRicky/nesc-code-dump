00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.300
So recently

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.480
there have been some moms slamming me for talking about side hustles.

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.281
This is the debit card that I get paid on for my side hustle.

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:11.681
If your husband takes care of all your needs

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:14.321
and you are 100% focused on your kids all the time,

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:16.321
but you can do something small while they're asleep

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:19.561
or something that fills your cup or you're passionate about,

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:21.281
there is nothing wrong

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:24.281
with having a creative way to make a little side income.

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:25.841
All the fun things that I like

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:27.521
that I normally give up when we're budgeting,

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:30.161
like coffee, I use my side hustle money on.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:33.681
I use my side hustle money to buy the giant pack of cloth diapers

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:36.361
that will get my infant until he's 2 years old.

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:38.961
We still don't go on vacations or do any crazy things.

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:40.601
And yes, we live within our means,

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:43.561
but like, if I wanna get my hair done every three months,

00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:45.481
it's expensive. It's kind of a luxury.

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:47.081
So sometimes I tell my husband, like,

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:49.321
don't worry, I have some money on my debit card.

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:50.961
I will use that. Also,

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:53.441
nothing wrong with just being a stay at home mom

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:56.801
and not working at all or being focused on any side hustle.

00:00:56.802 --> 00:01:00.601
You do what you need to do to make it work in your marriage,

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.441
in your parenting journey.

00:01:02.442 --> 00:01:04.641
Don't let anyone judge you, mama,

00:01:04.642 --> 00:01:06.281
for what you decide to do.

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:07.481
And yes, I'm talking

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:08.561
even to the women

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:11.681
who Have absolutely no way of staying home with their kids,

00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:13.401
because it just is not feasible,

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:15.101
and they have to work to provide.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.680
I'm talking to you, too.

00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:19.285
Don't be ashamed. We're all doing the best we can.
