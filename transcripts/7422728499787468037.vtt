00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
A man would be strategic. A woman would be manipulative.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.140
A man, a man would be a leader.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.020
A woman would be controlling.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.180
A man would be authoritative.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.060
A woman would be annoying.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.920
A man would be called confident,

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:19.741
but a woman would be called arrogant.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.780
A man would be on compromising.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.620
A woman would be a ball breaker.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.380
A man would be assertive. A woman would be aggressive.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.980
The behaviour is the same.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.980
What is different is the body exhibiting that behaviour.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.160
And so

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:37.681
I began to see that when people judge a woman for being aggressive

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:39.201
or ambitious or annoying,

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:42.241
it really wasn't qualities of ambition or aggression

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:45.641
that they were judging. It was actually women that were being judged.

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:48.101
So we should change laws that diminish women,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.380
but changing mindsets is even more important.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.180
We should enact policies that support women.
