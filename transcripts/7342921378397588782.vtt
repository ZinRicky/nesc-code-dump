00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.000
I've never fed my kids a PB and J sandwich before

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.560
and wanted them to know what it tastes like,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.480
so I'm making them uncrustable look alikes

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.840
except without all the junk.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.080
Rather than a store bought white bread

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.200
that's got synthetic vitamins and preservatives,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.600
I'm making a sourdough bread using all purpose eincorn,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.400
which is the world's most ancient wheat variety

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.560
that doesn't upset tummies

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.560
and because it still has 85% of the brand,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.480
it's got all the necessary vitamins and minerals

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.680
and won't spike insulin.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.280
I got started making a Berry jelly

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.320
with some spent berries,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.000
lemon, a tad bit of coconut sugar.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.320
It tastes just like Smuckers

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.560
without the high fructose corn syrup and citric acid.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.800
Because I'm making sourdough,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.640
I'll be finishing these sandwiches the next day

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.640
and I'll be assembling them for the kids lunch boxes.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.960
I'm not a fan of peanut butter

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.440
and it's not allowed at school because of

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.080
peanut allergy,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.560
so we'll be using an organic sunflower butter instead.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.600
These are the cutest little uncrustable sandwiches

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.520
that taste yummy

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.000
yet will leave my kitties with lots of long lasting

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.560
energy. And just like Uncrustables,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.380
they can easily be frozen too!
