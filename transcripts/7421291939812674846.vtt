Just wanna give you a little weekend recap here at the farm.

00:03.961 --> 00:08.561
So we headed to town and watch the boys play their games.

00:08.562 --> 00:11.201
We hit our neighbor's cattle drive on the way there

00:11.202 --> 00:15.141
and on the way back, so it made us late coming and going.

00:15.400 --> 00:19.100
We are enjoying the most beautiful fall here on the farm.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.220
We got our new ball and calves.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.800
These guys are going into our beef program.

00:23.801 --> 00:26.781
They were just weaned from their mamas and looking so good.

00:26.880 --> 00:27.920
Aubrey came up

00:27.921 --> 00:32.421
and we did a protein powder photo shoot with the animals.

00:32.680 --> 00:36.560
And we also did some stuff in the kitchen with the kids.

00:36.561 --> 00:39.521
Little hands. It's ready to go next week,

00:39.522 --> 00:41.881
which is very exciting. This video made me laugh.

00:41.882 --> 00:46.501
Of the traffic that we had on our driveway as we were leaving.

00:47.040 --> 00:47.880
Then that night,

00:47.881 --> 00:52.061
we had some friends over for the first dinner in a pumpkin of the year.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.660
Then we headed over to the dairy and did our nightly calf eating.
