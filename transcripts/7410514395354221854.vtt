00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
And they had a six figure job and I was the stay at home mom.

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:04.441
This is what happened to me.

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:06.361
So I'm just telling everyone of you,

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:08.081
if you are a stay at home parent,

00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:10.041
don't do it. Or if you are,

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:14.201
make sure that you get paid a salary by your ex.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:16.001
Put into an account for you.

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.141
Because I'm telling you right now,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.600
they will just up in one day,

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.401
17 years later, decide that they don't wanna do anything anymore.

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:24.161
After you supported their career

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.681
and you supported their dreams and hobbies,

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:29.001
one day they might just wake up and say, oh,

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:30.521
I don't wanna do this anymore.

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:33.961
And then you're homeless, single parent, um,

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:37.961
just trying to survive. I no longer have insurance on this house.

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:39.361
This house is. Isn't even mine.

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:41.201
Both of my parents died in the last year

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:42.881
and I've been staying in their house.

00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:45.001
Like the electric bills, not even in my name.

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:48.361
I had to go this morning and pay the past due Bill

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:49.681
so they wouldn't cut it off.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.041
I work on the weekends, I work through the week.

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:53.761
I am not making enough money.

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.641
I am trying. I'm disabled.

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:58.001
I was a stay at home mom for 14 years.

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:03.661
I haven't had a job interview outside of the home in 20 years.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.480
Um, I am literally doing my best.

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:10.881
I am drowning in debt, in, uh, depression,

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:14.361
in trauma. My ex sends me abusive text

00:01:14.362 --> 00:01:18.041
when I try To ask for anything to be done about the child support

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:18.961
for them to parent.

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:22.081
There will never be consequences for them ruining my credit

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.941
because they don't pay what is court ordered.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.480
There just never will be. And I know I'm bitching.

00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:28.721
I'm bitching, I don't care.

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.801
I'm bitching because it's not fair.

00:01:30.802 --> 00:01:32.761
And lots of women go through this

00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:35.846
and it's disgusting and sick and something should be done.
