00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
My boyfriend said I ruined dinner last night

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:04.721
because I use whole grain noodles instead of the regular kind.

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:07.201
I just read a fucking post online where the girl was like,

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:09.841
the whole situation turns into a screaming match.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.881
The guy throws the fucking noodles away

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:13.301
because of the way they're arguing.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.000
So she pushes him, and he falls on the ground,

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:17.841
and then he. She falls on the ground.

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:19.281
He trips her, so she falls on the ground,

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:21.001
so he starts pulling her hair.

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.461
So she's slapping him to get off of her,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.340
and she's like, am I crazy?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.280
So the guy apologizes to her like crazy,

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.321
and they end up sleeping in each other's arms.

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:36.461
And she's like, I don't know what to do.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.920
If you would use any of the fucking, like,

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.321
Grace and, like,

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:44.721
you know, cognitive dissonance you use to piece together.

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:45.961
Oh, I think he means he's sorry.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:49.041
Why can't you use that same fucking logic to piece together, like,

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:51.541
I'm in a dangerous situation and I need to leave?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.960
You don't need to ask 15 of your fucking friends,

00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:56.361
is this wrong? If you feel the need to, like,

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:58.301
talk to a friend and ask them their opinion,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.280
it's probably cause, you know,

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:01.321
what's fucking. The deal is,

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:03.761
you're just. You're looking for somebody to give you permission,

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.481
and you don't fucking need permission from anybody.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:06.761
You know, it's fucking wrong,

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:09.981
and so fucking leave. I just.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.800
I mean, I understand saying

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:14.121
because I've stayed, but, like,

00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:17.081
now I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:19.121
Look at me. Twisted the wrong way even once.

00:01:19.122 --> 00:01:21.221
No, I don't need that shit in my life.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.040
You're an extra thing. I'm at.

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.301
You're something. I'm like.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.620
It's like going to the store and purposely buying rotten food.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.720
Like, no,

00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:31.361
I know this is super bad for me.

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.041
I know I'm not ever gonna be able to use it.

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:34.121
It's not gonna do anything for me,

00:01:34.122 --> 00:01:36.741
but this is what I'm gonna spend all my energy on.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.940
Like, come the fuck on.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.840
It's not worth it to be in a relationship just to be in a relationship.

00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:44.101
But you're fucking miserable.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.980
You're just adding some shit to your life to make it fucking harder.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.060
Like what? Just to be like, I gotta be him,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.160
huh
