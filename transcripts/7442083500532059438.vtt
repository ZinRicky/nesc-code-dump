All the traveling and colder weather has made my skin extra dry lately,

00:04.041 --> 00:06.321
so it needs a little bit of extra help.

00:06.322 --> 00:10.281
After cleansing, I went in with the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Cream,

00:10.282 --> 00:12.041
which I love the thick texture of.

00:12.042 --> 00:14.841
The fact that it moisturizes me for 48 hours

00:14.842 --> 00:18.361
and instantly strengthens my skin's moisture barrier.

00:18.362 --> 00:19.921
I love that I can use Aveeno,

00:19.922 --> 00:22.921
which is proven to soothe and nourish sensitive

00:22.922 --> 00:25.401
and even eczema prone skin like mine.

00:25.402 --> 00:28.781
I love how it can keep me moisturized all day long.
