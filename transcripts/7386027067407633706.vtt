00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
This morning, my husband told me to be ready by four PM

00:02.961 --> 00:04.561
since he was taking me on a date.

00:04.562 --> 00:07.241
During my pregnancy, all I craved was raw fish,

00:07.242 --> 00:09.921
and I tried having it as little as possible.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.401
So now that I can have it again,

00:11.402 --> 00:13.481
he knew that he had to take me here.

00:13.482 --> 00:16.561
I usually look at the menu before I even get to the restaurant,

00:16.562 --> 00:18.401
so I knew exactly what I wanted.

00:18.402 --> 00:19.961
But lucky had a little look through,

00:19.962 --> 00:23.721
and we started off with a mocktail for me and a ginger beer for him.

00:23.722 --> 00:25.921
Then had to order some shishito peppers.

00:25.922 --> 00:27.321
We do that every restaurant.

00:27.322 --> 00:29.441
And some of the yellow tail sashimi.

00:29.442 --> 00:31.121
I also got crispy rice, tuna,

00:31.122 --> 00:35.121
and these wagyu. Little tacos are one of our favorite things to get,

00:35.122 --> 00:36.481
and I don't know what it is,

00:36.482 --> 00:40.041
but I prefer Nobu appetizers over the main dishes.

00:40.042 --> 00:41.761
After we made our way through those,

00:41.762 --> 00:45.601
we ordered our mains before it was time to order my second mocktail.

00:45.602 --> 00:47.001
I always tell the waiter

00:47.002 --> 00:49.961
to surprise me with whatever they think I would like,

00:49.962 --> 00:51.321
and it usually works out.

00:51.322 --> 00:54.401
Then we moved on to getting a second plate of the shishito peppers,

00:54.402 --> 00:55.961
and then our main dishes arrived.

00:55.962 --> 00:59.461
Lucky got some steak dish while I got the black miso con.

00:59.480 --> 01:03.680
Steak was so good and the cod was so flaky it just fell apart.

01:03.681 --> 01:06.201
I also got two sides of rice with that.

01:06.202 --> 01:07.561
Couldn't stop ordering sides.

01:07.562 --> 01:10.361
We Ended up having over 25 of these tacos

01:10.362 --> 01:12.501
and kept all the other sides coming.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.800
Time they would run out,

01:13.801 --> 01:15.961
and I moved on to my third mocktail of the night,

01:15.962 --> 01:18.401
and I was so stuffed at this point.

01:18.402 --> 01:21.761
So lucky paid and we left to find something sweet.

01:21.762 --> 01:24.081
I always need something sweet after having dinner,

01:24.082 --> 01:28.441
so I found this soft serve place and got myself a vanilla soft serve.

01:28.442 --> 01:30.161
This was actually really, really good.

01:30.162 --> 01:32.081
We ended up pumping some gas,

01:32.082 --> 01:34.761
and it was getting so cold so quick.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.881
So lucky got me a blanket from the gas station to bundle up in

01:37.882 --> 01:41.101
before we made our way down to the beach to catch the sunset.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.360
We haven't been in a while,

01:42.361 --> 01:44.461
but every time we go, it's so magical.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.660
And that's where we ended our night.
