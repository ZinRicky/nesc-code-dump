00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
I am definitely, um,

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:05.241
keeping everybody at a distance

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:07.881
and making sure that even though we live with my boyfriend,

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:11.301
that there's no confusion that he's not their stepdad.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.160
This is more like a little village setup,

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.381
because I am trying to protect my kids.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.240
You know, when I had children,

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:22.241
it was in a marriage, and I was expecting that to last forever,

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:24.601
and that didn't. And so now I'm like,

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:26.201
I put my everything into that.

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:27.481
Like, it should have lasted forever

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:31.041
and it didn't. So since I have no control over what somebody else does,

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:33.341
I can't control how our relationship is gonna.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.600
And, you know,

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.481
I wanted the first one to last forever,

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:38.181
and it didn't. So, um,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.280
I. I don't want my kids to have a super,

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:45.041
super deep affection for my boyfriend.

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.481
I kinda want it to be like,

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:48.361
that's mommy's boyfriend, you know?

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:49.161
Like, I'm.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.160
And I am 1,000% positive that this is like

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:58.501
my trauma and my issues that are causing this.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.920
But it's how I feel most comfortable right now.

00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:06.041
I don't want a boyfriend that wants to be their fucking stepdad.

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:10.061
I don't want someone that I have to figure out how to parent alongside

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.980
and still have to co parent with their actual father.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.980
For me, as a mom,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.880
it makes me feel uncomfortable.

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:20.041
It would make me feel uncomfortable if somebody was like,

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:22.961
trying to step in and be stepmom without meeting me

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:23.961
or like, without,

00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:26.301
like, if It's not gonna truly be a blended family.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.760
I feel like, okay,

00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:29.961
then that just feels disrespectful to the other parent,

00:01:29.962 --> 00:01:31.161
and I just don't wanna do that.

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:32.441
So, yeah,

00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:34.961
I'm super duper just a single mom.

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:37.161
Like, he.

00:01:37.162 --> 00:01:40.361
I've had a roommate for since I left my ex husband.

00:01:40.362 --> 00:01:42.521
So it is truly like he's my roommate.

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:45.881
We just also happen to have a romantic relationship.

00:01:45.882 --> 00:01:47.521
But, yeah,

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:48.521
that's kinda how I want it.

00:01:48.522 --> 00:01:51.241
I just. Me and my kids have been through too much.

00:01:51.242 --> 00:01:54.441
I don't want to sell them some fairy tale that Mommy met the one

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:56.121
and we're gonna be together forever.

00:01:56.122 --> 00:01:58.361
You know, Mommy's living with her boyfriend right now.

00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:00.221
We'll see how things go. Like,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.720
that's just where my heart feels comfortable for right now.

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.741
Who knows if things can change, but.
