if you live in the area that has been affected by Hurricane

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:07.480
you need one of these I never realized how much pollution and bacteria

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.640
and all that went into the air after Hurricane

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:11.620
until Hurricane had a dragon

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.940
and I got so sick with cold toxicity

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.840
and I had no idea that that was a thing that could happen

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:20.960
and so one of the things that my doctor recommended was getting air

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:21.800
air fires for our whole home

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:23.600
because we can't control what the air quality is like outside

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:26.160
but what we can control is what the quality of air is inside our home

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.120
and air air fires are fantastic for that

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:28.600
okay last year

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:30.400
we have invested in air purifiers for every room in the house

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:31.520
this one is for the homeschool room

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.280
and I can rest easy

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.460
knowing that the air we're breathing every day while we're schooling

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.500
is nice and clean
