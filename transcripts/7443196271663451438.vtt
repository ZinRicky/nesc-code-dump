00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
We're moving. This is our last take up video in the house.

00:04.081 --> 00:05.881
We spent all day packing up.

00:05.882 --> 00:08.821
Obviously, we got Thai food

00:11.280 --> 00:15.420
always on. Having the parody is something to think about here.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.660
We're moving all the way from Dallas to the East Coast,

00:19.480 --> 00:21.340
but this is what we've got.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.260
Boom,

00:23.080 --> 00:24.620
Bing, zip.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.600
We were so hungry today, so we got a bunch of different dishes.

00:29.601 --> 00:34.401
Okay, so the first one we got drunken noodles with beef.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.801
Always a classic, always good.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.621
We always get it. So spicy.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.280
Yes. Yeah.

00:39.281 --> 00:41.081
Lately we've been obsessed with this dish.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.981
It's just green beans and beef.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.000
Lucky gets it super spicy.

00:45.001 --> 00:48.261
I get it a level three. Out of what? Four.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.460
This is my dish.

00:51.800 --> 00:55.020
This one right here. Green beans,

00:55.440 --> 00:56.300
beef,

00:56.880 --> 00:58.300
onions,

00:58.840 --> 01:01.920
and some juice. You see that juice?

01:01.921 --> 01:04.121
And then my sister got Patsy,

01:04.122 --> 01:05.241
so I'm not gonna open that.

01:05.242 --> 01:08.481
That's hers. We obviously got some rice to go with it.

01:08.482 --> 01:10.481
And then we got what it is.

01:10.482 --> 01:14.581
Spicy edamame. I need your help opening this fully, please.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.860
Thanks.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.100
That doesn't look spicy.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.800
Got myself a little Thai tea.

01:24.801 --> 01:27.961
I needed to. They forgot that last time when I ordered food,

01:27.962 --> 01:31.041
which was very tragic. And then this.

01:31.042 --> 01:32.881
Can you open this for me, please, baby?

01:32.882 --> 01:35.221
And then we got Tonka soup,

01:35.720 --> 01:38.240
also very spicy. I'm feeling a little run down,

01:38.241 --> 01:41.121
so I got this to hopefully make me feel better.

01:41.122 --> 01:44.701
Now we are going to go eat and

01:46.000 --> 01:52.240
relax. And stuff our faces while we indulge.

01:52.241 --> 01:53.501
Bye, guys.
