00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
Made it home to Texas very late last night.

00:02.721 --> 00:05.241
We packed our bags, got four hours of sleep,

00:05.242 --> 00:07.181
and headed back to the airport.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.780
Car pick up was very early in the morning.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.160
Loaded up our car, got the kids in,

00:12.161 --> 00:14.121
and it was time to head to Europe.

00:14.122 --> 00:15.801
We're spending the rest of September

00:15.802 --> 00:18.201
and beginning of October in Europe.

00:18.202 --> 00:19.881
Our first stop is Frankfort,

00:19.882 --> 00:21.801
Germany, to drop the kids off.

00:21.802 --> 00:23.201
But once we got to the airport,

00:23.202 --> 00:25.281
we got checked in, checked in our bags,

00:25.282 --> 00:27.301
and then made it through security.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.080
The last three flights we were on,

00:29.081 --> 00:33.241
we've always been late, so we made sure that that was in the case today.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.721
We all had some breakfast,

00:34.722 --> 00:38.401
I grabbed some waters, and it was time to board our first flight.

00:38.402 --> 00:39.981
We were flying to Washington

00:40.000 --> 00:43.660
and then laying over and getting on a flight to Frankfort, Germany.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.160
This flight wasn't that long,

00:45.161 --> 00:47.721
and we managed to keep the kids entertained

00:47.722 --> 00:51.201
before we laid over in Washington and boarded our second flight,

00:51.202 --> 00:53.161
which was an eight hour long flight.

00:53.162 --> 00:55.361
Lucky sat in the front of the plane with rumble,

00:55.362 --> 00:57.601
while I sat with slim and whimsy.

00:57.602 --> 01:00.361
The first thing I need to do when I get on long flights

01:00.362 --> 01:02.001
is do my skincare routine.

01:02.002 --> 01:04.421
My skin gets so dry when I'm on the airplane,

01:04.440 --> 01:06.560
so this is always the first thing I do.

01:06.561 --> 01:07.801
Once I was done with that,

01:07.802 --> 01:10.641
I grabbed whimsy and got her to sleep.

01:10.642 --> 01:12.361
And A couple hours into our flight,

01:12.362 --> 01:14.041
all the babies were asleep,

01:14.042 --> 01:16.801
and I managed to get a couple of hours myself.

01:16.802 --> 01:20.461
Once we landed in Germany and grabbed our suitcases,

01:20.480 --> 01:23.160
one of my first stops had to be the grocery store,

01:23.161 --> 01:24.741
so that's where we went.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.920
Had to stock up on some nostalgic things for me,

01:27.921 --> 01:30.361
especially the tea. I was starving.

01:30.362 --> 01:32.841
So we got some lahmachun and dona,

01:32.842 --> 01:34.601
which always hits the spot.

01:34.602 --> 01:36.441
And just a few hours after this,

01:36.442 --> 01:38.901
we were on a plane to London with whimsy.
