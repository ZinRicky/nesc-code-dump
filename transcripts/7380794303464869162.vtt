00:00.000 --> 00:02.100
Mom and I are getting ready for the day.

00:02.440 --> 00:04.880
This is my OG complexion stick.

00:04.881 --> 00:07.821
My OG complexion stick right here.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.180
This copper. We're both copying this line underneath.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.660
Oh, wow.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.320
I don't like my nose to be white,

00:19.321 --> 00:20.361
so it's a little.

00:20.362 --> 00:22.401
I like my neck glowy.

00:22.402 --> 00:25.681
Glowy, glowy. Dewy. Dewy. Okay.

00:25.682 --> 00:29.641
Dewy gold. And I started wearing it, and it wasn't a day or two,

00:29.642 --> 00:31.821
and people were looking at me, and they were saying,

00:32.080 --> 00:33.160
you look younger.

00:33.161 --> 00:35.601
The bronzer? Yeah.

00:35.602 --> 00:36.701
So I like.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.040
Yeah, I like.

00:39.041 --> 00:39.561
Oh, yeah,

00:39.562 --> 00:41.401
I like that. So I'm using rose,

00:41.402 --> 00:43.301
but I'm gonna try her toe test. Can I?

00:46.040 --> 00:47.940
Okay,

00:51.400 --> 00:53.120
so with this one,

00:53.121 --> 00:54.241
these are my lips, too,

00:54.242 --> 00:56.301
but I usually put a liner on first.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.300
You like the pink better on your teeth?

01:02.240 --> 01:03.220
I

01:04.520 --> 01:06.660
don't like makeup under my brow.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.340
It just makes it lift.

01:10.360 --> 01:11.400
You lose their lips.

01:11.401 --> 01:13.181
Did you put some on?

01:13.800 --> 01:15.340
It goes on a little smoother.
