00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.800
we've just doubled the size of our garden

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.200
and by the ‘we’ I mean 

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.756
I gently bullied my husband into 

00:00:04.757 --> 00:00:06.360
building me two more planted boxes

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:07.800
but with the weather warming up and 

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:08.840
the long weekend incoming

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:10.640
I did feel that intense of urgency

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.960
because if I don't get the plants on the ground like now

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.377
then we won't be enjoying their 

00:00:14.378 --> 00:00:15.840
beautiful produce all summer long

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:16.600
and a little birdie

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:18.211
told me that The Warehouse has an 

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:20.060
incredible selection of garden supplies

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.884
including the healthiest little seedlings 

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:22.400
at every day low priced 

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.760
 so today I went to investigate

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:27.520
and it turns out the bird actually did have the authority on the word 

00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:29.520
because I found some great bargains 

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:32.320
including these ginormous tomato plants for only $10

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:34.860
which I've seen literally double the price elsewhere recently 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.760
I raced home and was so excited to get immediately stuck in

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:39.400
and I don't know what it is about the garden

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:41.240
but it's definitely one of my happy places

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.995
Mixed through some compost rush was

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:44.400
 a steal at only $5.50 a bag

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:45.655
I planted a few varieties

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:48.339
of  peas before getting started on my strawberry patch 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.875
and I’m really looking forward to coming out here and picking strawberries

00:00:50.876 --> 00:00:52.617
with the kids once they start ripening  

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.055
I’m gonna train a couple of varieties

00:00:54.056 --> 00:00:56.120
of courgettes up and over these trellises 

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.240
I did half a dozen more peas before thinning my tomato plants 

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.140
so they can focus more energy in on the fruit

00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:03.086
then I planted a raspberry and a rhubarb 

00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:04.680
but I'm telling you I can just about

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:06.020
taste the Christmas crumble

00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:08.560
I put in a dozen lettuces from two variety packs

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:10.568
so they’re all  different types which is perfect 

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.126
cos we’re definitely big salad people 

00:01:12.127 --> 00:01:15.390
and I finished up by planting my agria seed potatoes 

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.056
Which in about 90 days should be ready to harvest 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.865
Now is definitely the time to be planting your summer garden 

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.202
and The Warehouse has a great range 

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:28.020
if you’re on the hunt
