00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.920
The burden of responsibility in a relationship

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:04.041
is always gonna go from the parent to the child,

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:05.561
not the child to the parent.

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:07.521
So nothing bothers me more than when a parent says,

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:08.561
well, what about my feelings?

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:10.601
What about their consideration for me?

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:12.961
When talking about a conflict between a parent and a child,

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:14.601
even if that child is an adult.

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:15.881
So the big red flag there

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:18.201
is that they probably were never considered important

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:20.201
or their feelings hurt when they were kids,

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:21.521
and now they're expecting that

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.921
and feel entitled to that from their children.

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:25.601
And then they'll blame it on something of like,

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:27.361
well, they're adults now.

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:29.001
But in my opinion, that does nothing

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:29.601
except maybe

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:31.161
say that that person is adult enough

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:33.021
to know how to handle conflict resolution.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.240
The power dynamics,

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:37.301
and the burden of responsibility always flows downward.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.960
Just because your feelings were not prioritized by your parents

00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:40.361
does not mean

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:42.921
that your children are responsible for prioritizing yours.

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:45.261
Kids are not a fix it for a bad childhood.
