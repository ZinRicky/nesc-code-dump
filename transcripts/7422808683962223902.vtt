00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
I wanted to make something special for my husband today,

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:05.241
so I decided to make him a pumpkin cheesecake.

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:08.441
After baking a sugar pie pumpkin and scooping out the delicious splash,

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:09.721
I got started on my filling.

00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:12.841
It's impossible to find a real cheesecake with quality ingredients,

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:14.481
minimally sweet, and that tastes good, too.

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:16.881
But here we are. Pasteurized cream cheese,

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.181
probiotic sour cream, pumpkin,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.220
coconut sugar, lots of pumpkin pie spice,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.720
eggs for my chickens, vanilla and unrefined sea salt.

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:27.521
Next, I whipped up the keto crust

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:30.401
using crispy walnuts and almonds I had soaked and dehydrated

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:33.421
to remove phytic acid and neutralize enzyme inhibitors.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.040
Combined with a half a cup of dates,

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:36.961
I pressed this into a springform pan

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.121
and then poured my filling up to the top.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:42.041
This baked for 40 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.761
When it was cool, I placed it in the fridge,

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:45.441
and many hours later when it was cold,

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:47.641
I got to making my fresh caramel drizzle.

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:49.841
I then whipped up some raw cinnamon whipped cream,

00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.461
which only took about one minute,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.080
and then I finished the cheesecake.

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:55.161
The springform pan attached perfectly.

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:57.001
I flipped the cheesecake onto a cake stand

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:58.561
and then drizzled caramel over top,

00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:00.241
followed by a bunch of fresh whip.

00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:03.461
The moment of truth came when I cut into this thick cheesecake.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.680
All I could hope for was the cheesecake flavor with a crunchy,

00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:08.681
perfect crust. It was so insane.

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:09.601
Mouth watering, really.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:12.123
My husband told me it Was the best dessert I had ever made.
