I remember how overwhelmed I was picking a diaper brand

00:03.320 --> 00:04.880
when I had my kids,

00:04.880 --> 00:07.800
but codery quickly became my favourite brand to use.

00:07.800 --> 00:08.800
And now that they're older,

00:08.800 --> 00:10.220
we use the pants.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.120
So easy to just slip on.

00:12.120 --> 00:14.800
And they came out with a new version of it that has

00:14.800 --> 00:16.600
higher cut and improved Velcro,

00:16.600 --> 00:18.600
so it makes them even more comfortable

00:18.600 --> 00:21.760
and makes it easier for my babies to move around

00:21.760 --> 00:23.480
and nothing to be leaking.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.720
Changing toddlers is an Olympic sport,

00:25.720 --> 00:26.560
so with the pant

00:26.560 --> 00:28.608
it's so nice that you can do it standing up.
