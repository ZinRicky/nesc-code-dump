You know those nights

00:00.961 --> 00:03.761
where you just want a little snack before you go to bed?

00:03.762 --> 00:05.441
Today was one of those nights for me.

00:05.442 --> 00:08.121
So I decided to make some potato chips.

00:08.122 --> 00:10.601
Lately I've been obsessed with barbecue flavour,

00:10.602 --> 00:13.241
so that's exactly what we're going for today.

00:13.242 --> 00:15.921
Started by slicing my potatoes very thin

00:15.922 --> 00:19.641
and then putting them in some ice water for about 30 minutes.

00:19.642 --> 00:24.041
In the meantime, I made my barbecue seasoning by combining some paprika,

00:24.042 --> 00:25.561
chili, brown sugar,

00:25.562 --> 00:27.041
garlic powder, salt,

00:27.042 --> 00:28.881
a little bit of citric acid,

00:28.882 --> 00:32.641
not too much. Set that aside while I heated up my oil.

00:32.642 --> 00:33.921
While that was heating up,

00:33.922 --> 00:37.641
I made sure to dry all of my potato chips very well.

00:37.642 --> 00:41.161
Once my oil reached about 325 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:41.162 --> 00:42.921
I dropped my potatoes in it.

00:42.922 --> 00:44.361
Did this in batches

00:44.362 --> 00:47.721
and kept them moving around until they turned golden brown.

00:47.722 --> 00:48.601
Once they were done,

00:48.602 --> 00:52.601
I put them on some paper towel to soak up all the extra oil

00:52.602 --> 00:53.641
while they were still hot.

00:53.642 --> 00:55.441
I seasoned them in batches,

00:55.442 --> 00:56.981
toss them in my seasoning

00:57.240 --> 00:59.800
and then moved on to frying off my next batch.

00:59.801 --> 01:01.321
I did about four batches

01:01.322 --> 01:04.881
and then use the rest of my seasoning to toss my potatoes in

01:04.882 --> 01:07.681
and they were done. These have been my new obsession

01:07.682 --> 01:10.701
and lucky ended up having a bunch of them as well.
