00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.665
could I have cleaned my entire house 

00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.081
in the time it took me to do this

00:00:03.082 --> 00:00:04.061
one bathroom?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.160
yes yes I couldâ€™ve 

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.481
and I feel like her and I might have a fair bit in common

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.201
because she might look clean on the surface

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:10.281
but once you get to know her

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:11.921
you'll find out she's fkn filthy

00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:14.001
so this is the only bathroom we have in our house

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:15.481
and it services my family of five 

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.881
we have other toilets thankfully

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.041
so that when my husband runs off for three hours at a time

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:20.801
I can actually access this one. anyway

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:22.485
between the five of us and our endless 

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:24.041
rotation of house guests over summer

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:26.001
this bathroom has taken an absolute beating

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:27.521
the first step was to strip out the shower

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:29.921
and then spray it within an inch of its life with mould killer

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:32.161
and I let that marinate while I cracked on with this drawer

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:34.521
and I really got no one to blame for this mess but myself

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:35.321
in my defence

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:36.561
end of last year was hectic

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:39.321
I had an event or two to go to pretty much every single day

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:40.401
plus we're renovating

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:43.281
and we were hosting Christmas and New Years and house guests

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:44.481
and I just haven't had a minute 

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:46.281
but it's January and I'm back on my shit again

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:47.880
and I've decided that I'm getting my 

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:48.961
entire house deep cleaned

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:50.941
decluttered and organised before

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.800
well before I lose the motivation I guess

00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.409
and please don't judge the state of my 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.481
brushes or my sponges okay

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:56.481
I'm already judging me

00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:57.361
enough for the both of us

00:00:57.362 --> 00:00:59.441
I think I did five rounds of little baths for them

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:00.281
and then when I was happy

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:01.521
I set them out until the sun to dry

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:03.361
when I got on with organising the rest of my makeup

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:05.041
I like to organise my makeup by categories

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:05.721
if you know what I mean

00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:07.161
so I got a section for eyes and brows

00:01:07.162 --> 00:01:07.921
a section for lips

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:08.761
a section for face

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:09.721
a section for my palettes

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:10.281
that sort of thing

00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:11.121
and then on the other side

00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:12.614
I wanted to try and actually make some 

00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:13.801
space for the rest of my family

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:15.681
so I've got all of our hair stuff in one basket

00:01:15.682 --> 00:01:18.157
and then our oral hygiene stuff in the other basket 

00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:18.681
Side note

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:21.081
but I'm trying to manifest two more bathrooms in this house

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:22.241
by the end of the year this year

00:01:22.242 --> 00:01:23.361
tall order I know

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:25.761
but I need to put a bathroom in downstairs for my sons

00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:27.281
and I need to put an ensuite in

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:28.081
you know, for me

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:29.421
and then I imagine my daughter and my 

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.761
husband will share this bathroom until

00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:32.861
she gets old enough and kicks him out too 

00:01:32.862 --> 00:01:33.841
and so yes I will admit

00:01:33.842 --> 00:01:36.161
this bathroom is absolutely overflowing with product

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.201
but just remember

00:01:37.202 --> 00:01:38.641
no actually I can't even say thereâ€™s 

00:01:38.642 --> 00:01:39.441
5 of us sharing it

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:40.561
cause this is all my shit

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:41.361
I like skincare

00:01:41.362 --> 00:01:42.241
okay arrest me

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:44.241
I organised all my face stuff into brands

00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:45.001
and then on this side

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.561
I've got hair and body care

00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:48.561
and then once the section of the bathroom was organised

00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:50.281
it was time to get cracking on the deep clean

00:01:50.282 --> 00:01:50.801
and honestly

00:01:50.802 --> 00:01:51.841
this is my favourite part

00:01:51.842 --> 00:01:52.841
I do like organising

00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:54.241
but I just like cleaning better

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:54.681
but honestly

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:56.281
organising this bathroom is such a punish

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.041
cause it's so tiny

00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:58.761
so what you didn't see was me off camera

00:01:58.762 --> 00:02:00.601
sitting in the hallway with three kids and a dog

00:02:00.602 --> 00:02:02.401
going through each and every one of my products

00:02:02.402 --> 00:02:04.521
trying to decide what to keep and what was expired

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:06.201
and where was my husband throughout all of this

00:02:06.202 --> 00:02:07.441
I hear you asking

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:08.441
he was at golf

00:02:08.442 --> 00:02:09.801
not even a word of a lie

00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:10.641
but I was happy for him

00:02:10.642 --> 00:02:11.521
he doesn't golf often

00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:13.289
I think it's important for him to go out and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.481
have guy time, whatever. plus

00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:15.401
this is my happy place

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:16.681
and if he was here trying to help me

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:17.641
I'd be pissed off by now

00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:18.721
telling him to get the fk out

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:21.041
I decided to try the TikTok baking soda and vinegar

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:21.921
Hack down the drain

00:02:21.922 --> 00:02:23.121
don't know if it was doing anything

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:24.761
but it felt like it was doing something

00:02:24.762 --> 00:02:27.321
and then I just steamed everything as much as I possibly could

00:02:27.322 --> 00:02:29.401
honestly that steamer is my favourite gadget

00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:31.001
it was the best purchase of 2023

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:32.241
you would have heard me say it before

00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:35.088
my only regret is that I didn't get all of my cleaning appliances sooner 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:37.201
honestly if my children ever decide to get married

00:02:37.202 --> 00:02:37.961
not to each other

00:02:37.962 --> 00:02:39.441
obviously, to other people

00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:41.043
I'm gonna get them all new cleaning 

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:42.601
appliances as their wedding presents

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.920
I just feel like a new family needs to start off with new cleaning appliances

00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:48.601
then you can take care of them and hopefully keep them for years and years

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.481
my dad's always known how much I love to clean

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:51.481
I take after my mum

00:02:51.482 --> 00:02:52.161
in that respect

00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:53.281
and so when I got married

00:02:53.282 --> 00:02:55.281
he decided to get me a washing machine

00:02:55.282 --> 00:02:56.041
yeah it was second hand

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:57.281
I think it cost him 50 bucks

00:02:57.282 --> 00:02:58.901
and we had to go pick it up ourselves

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.960
not to sound ungrateful

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:01.338
but I really didn't wanted to clean my 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:02.681
wedding present before I got to use it

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.241
you know what I mean

00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:04.001
don't come at me that

00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:05.201
he was probably hard up against it

00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:06.321
or he just paid for our wedding

00:03:06.322 --> 00:03:07.721
cause neither of those are applicable

00:03:07.722 --> 00:03:08.801
anyway love my dad

00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:10.266
probably would have loved him more if he 

00:03:10.267 --> 00:03:11.481
got me a brand new washing machine ðŸ¤­

00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:12.321
12 years later

00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:14.621
and she's still obviously still a bit salty about it

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.040
 Nah, it's just funny now

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:17.441
sorry about the rant dad. anyway

00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:18.521
we're on the homestretch now

00:03:18.522 --> 00:03:20.041
and it's time to clean out the final cupboard

00:03:20.042 --> 00:03:20.601
and i wonâ€™t lie

00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:21.641
I saved this one til last

00:03:21.642 --> 00:03:23.681
because I seriously considered just not doing it

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:24.841
but I wanted to do it because I

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:26.481
wanted to give my husband a little space

00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:27.321
and by â€˜a little spaceâ€™

00:03:27.322 --> 00:03:28.761
I mean he now has two shelves ðŸ˜‡

00:03:28.762 --> 00:03:29.961
look at me being all generous & shit

00:03:29.962 --> 00:03:30.801
but seriously

00:03:30.802 --> 00:03:31.641
last time I did this

00:03:31.642 --> 00:03:32.521
I had a bunch of comments from

00:03:32.522 --> 00:03:34.641
people telling me that it didn't leave my husband enough room

00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:35.401
okay firstly

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:36.761
he has like 3 products

00:03:36.762 --> 00:03:38.281
he doesn't need a bunch of space secondly

00:03:38.282 --> 00:03:40.641
he knows he's welcome to share anything in this bathroom

00:03:40.642 --> 00:03:41.601
and he uses the skincare

00:03:41.602 --> 00:03:42.643
 behind the mirror too 

00:03:42.644 --> 00:03:44.401
And thirdly I don't know what it is about guys

00:03:44.402 --> 00:03:45.801
or maybe it's just my guy

00:03:45.802 --> 00:03:47.401
but he looks really good with wrinkles

00:03:47.402 --> 00:03:49.233
so can you blame me for gatekeeping some 

00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:50.266
of my anti ageing shit 

00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:52.321
wow okay we've really covered some ground in this one

00:03:52.322 --> 00:03:53.241
and I apologise

00:03:53.242 --> 00:03:55.641
but I also can't help but spin a yarn

00:03:55.642 --> 00:03:56.801
Ok. I'm officially over it now

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:57.561
my feet are aching

00:03:57.562 --> 00:03:58.401
my back is aching

00:03:58.402 --> 00:04:00.761
my mouth is aching from all of this shit talk

00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:02.641
and even though I didn't fill up my drawers with teeny

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:03.921
tiny mouthwashes and teeny

00:04:03.922 --> 00:04:05.121
tiny toothpicks and teeny

00:04:05.122 --> 00:04:07.121
tiny other shit that I probably don't need

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.881
look itâ€™s a realistic reset I guess

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:10.431
but it does kinda make me wonderâ€¦
