00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.960
it's another day of homeschool at the Hollies

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:03.440
and today we're starting with speech therapy

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:06.160
today we tried something new and went live during our math lessons

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:09.080
and we had a blast I really love sharing our homeschool days

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.840
and I am so passionate about helping

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.640
and teaching other parents how to homeschool too

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:15.280
you get little snippets of that here and there and these voice overs

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.120
but going live was just a whole another level

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:19.520
it was like giving you a front seat into our classroom

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:20.840
basically you got to see a real

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:22.680
unedited school which was so cool

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.040
is to encourage other parents who are either new to homeschooling

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.120
or on the fence about homeschooling

00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:27.040
that you can do it too

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:29.920
it also give you all a chance to ask questions about what I'm teaching

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:31.600
why I'm teaching different teaching methods

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:33.040
different curriculums all of the things

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:35.840
and those are the things I absolutely love having conversations about

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:37.920
I will say it was a bit of a distraction

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:39.800
and kind of hard to do both at the same time

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:41.580
so I'm not gonna do it all the time

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.000
but I would love to do this more often

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.440
if it's something that you would find beneficial

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:45.080
so if there's like

00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:48.440
a specific topic or subject that you need help teaching

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.980
and kind of want me to teach you how I would teach it

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.760
let me know in the comments

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:53.640
maybe we'll start like a TikTok live trading

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:55.120
where I teach you how to teach your own kids

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.760
so we can all be homeschooling together

00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:58.760
the requirements would be a cozy blanket

00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:00.080
coffee and lots of snack

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:02.206
now that sounds like a teacher trading I could get into
