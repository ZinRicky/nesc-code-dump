00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.680
I'm on team wash your chicken before cooking.

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:04.961
Although many feel you should not wash your chicken,

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:08.241
I'm starting with a fully pasture raised chicken from my parents farm

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:09.841
that was slaughtered at 3 months of age

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:12.441
right there on the farm in a healthy farm environment.

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:14.281
After washing and preparing the poultry,

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.641
I clean my work surfaces

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:18.001
tools in the surrounding area with branch basics.

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:18.721
A superior

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:21.921
non toxic cleaning product that's not only free of harmful chemicals,

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:23.121
it's also cheaper. Well,

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:24.841
it can't get any healthier than this bird,

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:27.321
but still, I feel more comfortable washing my chicken.

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:29.121
I prefer to start with a clean slate,

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.401
free of debris, filament,

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:32.281
or whatever may be left over on the meat

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.801
from the slaughtering and processing.

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:35.721
I always wash my meats and my fish too.

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:38.441
I also rinse my legumes, rice and nuts before cooking.

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:40.601
And if you're wondering, I get 64 laundry loads

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:42.881
plus 14 bottles of home and kitchen cleaning products

00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:45.401
out of one bottle of Branch Basics concentrate. Alright.

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:46.601
And this is peach chicken.

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:47.520
Insane, I tell you.
