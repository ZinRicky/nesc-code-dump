00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.440
So I made a little Pinterest.

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:02.321
Look at my feet.

00:00:02.322 --> 00:00:02.961
Are you joking?

00:00:02.962 --> 00:00:03.521
Look at my feet.

00:00:03.522 --> 00:00:05.361
I'm sorry. I'm sure everyone is already sick of this photo,

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:06.121
but I'm still here.

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:08.281
And, like, this has been so fun.

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:11.801
I literally never saw fat people on Pinterest growing.

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:13.161
I never saw people with curly hair

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:15.161
that would look up curly hairstyles on Pinterest.

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:16.001
It would all be like,

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.881
white women curl and not, like, natural.

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:18.361
I just, like,

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:20.161
never saw myself represented on Pinterest.

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:20.641
And I, like,

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:21.981
at my grown age,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.080
I just get to be the representation that I wanted to be.

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:25.921
And I get to post these little pictures that are.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.121
They're so Pinterest.

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:28.681
And, like, I don't care about likes,

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:29.801
I don't care about comments,

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:31.001
follows, literally anything.

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.001
I just care about making my feet, like,

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.801
a fun little place to share my fun little picture.

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:35.521
And I'm literally just, like,

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:36.961
having such a great time right now.

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.321
Maybe the time fixation will last for, like, five more minutes,

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:39.721
but, like,

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:43.161
I have maybe 60 pictures from this day that I still wanna post,

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:44.961
and then I'm gonna immortalize them on here,

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:45.601
like, on Instagram,

00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:47.121
anything more than a single carousel post,

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:47.641
my photo shoot.

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:48.761
I'm like, okay, enough.

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:49.721
No one else wants to see that.

00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:50.601
But here, I don't care.

00:00:50.602 --> 00:00:51.281
No one follows me,

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:52.121
no one knows what's going.

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:53.801
I can spam, I can post as much as I want.

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:56.921
This is literally what I wish Instagram was just picture and fun.

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:59.281
I love everyone else is on Pinterest and I'm just late to the party,

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:01.401
but I think we should all be on this app.

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:02.281
Not enough, by the way.

00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:04.441
Just so chill and fun and sweet and cute.

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:06.361
Trying desperately to convince all my friends to go.

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:07.961
And if you're someone who has a fun little Pinterest feed,

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:09.561
please let me know and share it below

00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:10.681
cause I currently don't follow anyone.

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:11.481
He's having so much fun!

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:12.336
Okay. Anyways, yeah.
