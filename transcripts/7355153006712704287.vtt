00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.880
you never and I mean never

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.881
leave someone who is drunk alone without a way to get home

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:10.361
I was leaving the library at 5:00am and this girl

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:13.241
I hear her come into the library just as my Uber is pulling up

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:16.641
and she's asking security guard if he had a charger because her phone was dead

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:17.641
and I'm like what's going on

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:18.981
and as I'm walking out

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.880
like the security guard is being useless

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:25.041
and so I give her my portable charger and this girl is p!ssed drnk

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:26.901
like it is 5:00am

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.840
she's like in boots

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:30.581
she has she's not aware of what's going on

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.320
and like I'm trying to help her like

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:34.241
figure out where she needs to go for her phone is dead

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.321
it's charging on my thing

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:36.041
eventually I just like

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:40.001
I have to type her address into my phone and call her Uber myself

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:44.121
because I don't know who she was with or what her friends were doing

00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:48.681
but I cannot comprehend how you go out with someone who

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.721
I'm assuming you call your friend

00:00:50.722 --> 00:00:55.541
and then leave them in New York City alone p!ss drnk 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.200
especially right now when people are getting punched in the face

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:01.161
what is wrong with you

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:02.481
I don't care what the situation

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:06.601
there is no reason why you should be letting your friend who is like

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:08.341
so drnk that they can't function

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.600
walk home alone

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:12.961
especially if they're girl and especially if their phone is dead

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:14.801
anyone that does it to you is not your friend

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:16.081
and y'all need to be better friends

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:17.503
Iâ€™m like so mad right now
