00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.840
I'm back. The last time I've been on TikTok

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.620
talking about the manosphere and all that good stuff

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.780
was probably July.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.920
My man and my kid come first,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.380
so I had to take away some valuable family time.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.960
Also, I'm having another baby in, like,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.160
less than three months.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.960
Yep. I am a full seven months Pregers.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.640
And on top of all of that,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.640
I started thinking one.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.880
I was doing a lot of homesteading stuff,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.180
and I wanted to find a way to make more money from home.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.840
As y'all know,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.080
I have traditional values,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.340
and I ain't putting my kid in the daycare.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.760
2 politically and socially,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.340
we complain so much about

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.820
women not staying at home anymore.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.960
The Manosphere's only solution is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.280
go back to your 20s and find a high value man.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.600
So for the rest of us women

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.060
stuck out here in the real world,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.680
where are all the solutions?

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.680
Where are the problem solvers

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.600
of this? Now,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.000
a lot of y'all are super negative,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.800
but there is a plethora of people

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.880
and influencers actually

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.640
trying to help shape and change culture. After all,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.800
that's how we got to this position to begin with.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.600
So I started a community

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840
for women wanting to work from home.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.540
It's in the most lucrative industry of 2023 and 2024,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.180
and I'm killing it.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.440
Anyway, that is my late night update.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.800
I took some family time,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.180
I got pregnant.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.280
I started a full business in digital marketing

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.920
with a Big community of women.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.600
And now it's time to branch out to my people

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.900
on the TikTok.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.583
I'll see y'all down the road.
