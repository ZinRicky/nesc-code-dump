00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
So I need to make some room in the freezers

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:04.581
for all the meat birds we have left to butcher.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.120
So I'm gonna preserve the rest of the deer meat

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.621
we have in the bottom of the freezer.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.160
So to preserve this deer meat,

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:12.421
I'm gonna make it into deer jerky.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm gonna start off by slicing it really thinly

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:16.441
with an extremely sharp knife.

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:17.421
This way,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.800
the meat will dry out and preserve evenly.

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:23.901
The thinner the meat is, the better it will preserve.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.560
Now, I'm gonna leave this to sit in the marinade for about six hours

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.341
before I put it in the dehydrator.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.720
I was checking out the cookbook that it came with,

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.521
and I'm super interested in these dehydrated egg yolks.

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:38.301
I've never seen anything like that.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.800
Then I'm gonna painstakingly lay each piece of meat out

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:47.201
flat onto the racks. I wanna make sure that the meat's not folded over,

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:49.581
so that way it will dehydrate evenly.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.680
And I was gonna pop all the trays into the dehydrator

00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:55.761
and let that sit at 1:65 for at least six hours.

00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:56.921
I'm gonna keep coming back and check.

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:59.541
I don't want it to be over dehydrated where it's, like, brittle.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.320
But I also wanna make sure it's all dried out,

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:03.621
otherwise it'll go moldy.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.920
Once all the meat has dehydrated evenly,

00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:07.561
I'm gonna put it into a ziploc bag.

00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:09.401
And it should last a few weeks in the pantry,

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.008
but we normally eat there within a few Days
