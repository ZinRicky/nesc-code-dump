00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.520
Hey, my name is Lisa, and I have a cow.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.580
So that means everyday I milk her.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.880
Here is the process of putting up her milk

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.060
after I milked her.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.140
First, I need to sanitize my whole working area.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.160
And I'm gonna pick out some bottles

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.920
that I wanna put the milk in today.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.240
I'm picking the square bottle

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.920
because I really like it.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.520
And I'm not selling this milk today,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.720
so I get to keep this.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.900
It stays at my house.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.400
And I picked two half gallon jars

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.400
that I might sell to somebody else.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.200
This is a dairy filter.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.280
This is for dairy milk only people.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.280
Some people use, like,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.920
rags and coffee filters,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.960
and this is specifically designed to filter milk,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.440
and that's what it's good for doing.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.680
I'm not gonna use a coffee filter and rewash it,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.860
because that is gross.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.460
Just my opinion.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.640
Now I just need to pick up this heavy 2 gallons of milk.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.540
Well, it was about two and a half gallons.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.880
Um, I got enough jars of the two gallons,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.320
but it ended up being two and a half,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.100
and the dog got half a gallon.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.240
Now the milk will flow pretty fast for the filter.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.440
Now, if she has mastitis,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.960
there'll be some,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.980
like, boogers and goop and grossness in the milk,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.240
and the filter will catch that

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.400
and it will start slowing down.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.940
And I will stay in the filter.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.600
Today she doesn't have any issues

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.800
and she hasn't Had issues in a long time.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.340
So this milk is healthy and good to consume.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.740
The filter is used to filter out mastitis.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.040
And any other issues in the milk.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.280
Could be just like a fly,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.960
a piece of dust,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.940
a piece of hay,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.720
all that stuff.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.640
You don't want the milk.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.860
And this will work to get it all out. The milk.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.880
Then I'm gonna retrieve my sharpie

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.460
that I hide from the kids,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.100
and write today's date.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.360
This is the date that I milked the cow.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.320
And the milk will be good for two weeks

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.020
from the date that it was milked,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.480
as long as I get the milk in the fridge within one hour.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.800
This milk has been out of Cora for about 20 minutes,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.900
so we're still in the good time.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.800
Soon as I'm done filtering this milk,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.680
getting some jars,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.320
I will throw it straight in the fridge,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.820
in the back of the fridge,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.340
to try and get it chilled as fast as possible.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800
This is really important

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.400
because all the bacteria that's in the milk,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.600
I want the good bacteria.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.300
I don't want the bad bacteria to start to take over

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.980
and sour the milk faster.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.840
Now I'm gonna place some reusable plastic lids on top.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.280
They seal pretty nicely.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.080
And I'm gonna dry the jars

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.840
to make sure there's no cross contamination

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.060
into my fridge.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.180
And here's a cool fridge shot. Enjoy.
