00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.320
What I eat in a day as a mom who eats an ancestral diet

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:05.081
and as someone who avoids seed oils,

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:06.161
artificial sugars,

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:08.081
dyes, and preservatives at all costs.

00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:10.601
I start my morning off with a glass of filtered water

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:12.081
and lemon juice from my tree.

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:14.121
Then I make a pour over coffee with organic

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:17.001
mold free beans and a good amount of raw pasteurized cream.

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:21.001
At 9:00am I whip up a batch of sourdough discard blueberry muffins

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:21.881
which fermented

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:24.621
overnight to neutralize phytic acid and enzyme inhibitors.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.360
While those bake

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:28.161
I make 100% grass fed beef breakfast sausages

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:30.521
and some eggs for my backyard pasta raised chickens.

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:33.721
Then I take my birthright prenatal and hormone balancing supplement

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:36.281
which I love because they're made with ancestral real foods

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:39.541
like raw 100% grass fed beef liver and colostrum

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.760
about fish row and oysters.

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:44.001
At 10:00am I prepared a heritage breed hold chicken

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.781
that had been pasture raised and slaughtered on my parents farm.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.320
Season with unrefined sea salt,

00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:49.281
pepper, herbs,

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:50.081
garlic and onion.

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.641
I let this bake in the oven at 300 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:53.821
until dinner time.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.680
Made myself a rock of your smoothie at two PM

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.401
with my homegrown frozen peaches,

00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:00.321
tamarillos and garnished with bee pollen.

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:01.361
Later that afternoon

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:03.001
I whipped up a raw cheesecake

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:05.601
using homemade raw cream cheese from my parents farm,

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:08.081
eggs from my chickens, and a nut and date crust.

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:09.521
We had dinner at 6

00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:11.241
which was a chicken noodle soup

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:13.601
topped with homemade pickled Radish and rock crout

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:14.661
and some avocado

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.060
followed by a slice of raw cheesecake.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.507
It was so delicious.
