00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.480
Here's some foods I made today

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:03.081
as a mom who has three young children

00:00:03.082 --> 00:00:05.041
and wants her family to have optimal health.

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:07.121
Started off the morning making overnight fermented

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.721
freshly milled iron corn pancakes

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:09.561
served with raw butter

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:12.041
and a fried egg from our pasture raised chickens out back.

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.121
At 8:00am I made myself an omelet

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:16.121
using two eggs from my pasture raised chickens

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:17.641
along with some leftover salad from dinner.

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.841
I wanted to surprise my kids with cinnamon rolls

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:21.201
when they came back from school today,

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:23.841
so around noon I shaped sourdough pumpkin cinnamon rolls

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:25.681
and let those rise for about two hours.

00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:27.321
I also made a large batch of mayonnaise

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:29.641
to have on hand for lunch boxes for a few weeks

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:31.281
to use in tomorrow's chicken salad.

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:33.281
At four PM I quickly prepped a whole chicken

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:34.441
which only took 10 minutes

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.081
and then stuck it in the oven for dinner.

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:37.321
After that came out of the oven,

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:39.921
I allowed it to rest while getting started on my corn tortillas.

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:42.841
While my Kamal heated, I mixed masaharina with water,

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.601
then kneaded it on the counter until smooth.

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:47.281
Then I made small rounds and flattened each with a tortilla press,

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:49.681
then cooked them for about 45 seconds per side.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.281
Around 5:45 I dressed the salad with a light vinaigrette

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:54.081
and served the kids and husband tacos,

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:57.215
myself a chicken salad, and at 7:30 I started a bone broth.
