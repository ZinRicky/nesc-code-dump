00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Okay, I wanna make something very clear here.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.900
I do not hate Taylor Swift. Okay.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.860
I do not hate Taylor Swift. Okay.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.160
Right. I'm going to the eras to up

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.820
just to be completely transparent.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.220
I will be there.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.420
I'm a Gayla.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.260
I'm a Kayla.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.820
I'm a I'm a Swiftie.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.760
Okay. I'm a Swiftie.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.580
But here is the thing

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.220
and I've said it on here before and I'll say it again.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.240
The most important thing we need to be able to do

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.940
as feminist when we raise our feminist consciousness

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.740
is we need to be able to hold

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.980
contradictions in our mind.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.760
We need to be able to hold contradictions.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.220
Being a woman in a patriarchy,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.100
one of our biggest strength is to learn how to hold

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.180
contradictions.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.940
I love pop music.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.820
I love being a girly pop.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.600
For me, that symbolizes so much in my life.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.880
Like it symbolizes my freedom.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.380
It symbolizes my ability

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.880
to just be a girl and be a girl's girl.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.100
It symbolizes

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.840
I fuck you to all of my exes

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.480
who thought that they had better taste in music than me.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.000
It symbolizes just joy and freedom

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.720
and clocking off and switching off

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.240
and just being able to enjoy something

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.880
for the sake of it.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.200
Because my full time job is being a professional

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.840
feminist. I am

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.400
I have a doctor in feminism.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.040
I run a feminist text startup.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980
I run a feminist consulting agency.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.320
I run a feminist TikTok.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.000
My full time job is being A feminist

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.880
and using my brain in that way.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880
So for me, being able to like

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.320
indulge myself in like

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.260
pop culture is like

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.640
genuinely something that feels like an indulgence

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.780
and something that I love to do

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.080
and something that's important for me

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.240
in my personal life

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.660
to be able to embrace completely

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.680
Taylor Swift.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.560
And loving Taylor Swift

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.920
also symbolizes my relationship with my little sister

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.540
who has like

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.400
Taylor Swift is

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.900
like her special interest

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.160
and we've always connected over it.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.880
And like we're going to the concert together

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.120
and it's just something that me and my sister just

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.000
are able to fully connect over.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.320
And to me, that is like

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.340
very beautiful and very important.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.000
Also, just think

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.120
being a Taylor Swift fan is so much fun.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.600
And I often just feel like people who don't get it

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600
are missing out

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600
because it is just like

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.660
fun to be a part of this community. However,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.380
we need to be able to freely hold

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.440
people in power to account

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.200
and we need to be able to love something.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.340
Like you love Harry Potter,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.480
but you can still critique JK.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.180
Rowling or critique the books themselves,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.640
like the podcast,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.240
which please

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.820
does a really good job of that.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.200
You can, you need to be able to like

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.960
fully love this

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.920
and you do this with love.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.240
You're like,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.440
I love this thing

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.960
and I care about this thing

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.040
and I can also critique this thing.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.280
And those two things can both be true.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.660
At once when you love and care for something,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.440
you want it to work out.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.480
You want it to be okay.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.500
And I think

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.560
we need to be okay in this world.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.640
Like things are complex.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.520
We know so much.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.380
We got just like

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.080
social media and globalization

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.600
and just like this crazy economy and these wars.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.260
And like one of your best

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.200
tools in your tool belt

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.800
for still being able to enjoy life and

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.920
turn down your critical

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.600
dial and not let it all overwhelm you

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.320
and enjoy the things you love,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.600
um, even if they're slightly problematic,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.540
while also being able to analyze

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.460
and kind of critique

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.580
those things as well.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.440
And knowing how to do those things at once is gonna be

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.980
like one of the most valuable

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.420
like intellectual tools in your toolkit for surviving

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.240
in what I feel is an increasingly apocalyptic

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.260
kinda world.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.113
So that's what I think about that.
