I love an insulated mug and here is why.

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:06.241
I would normally spend my day reheating my coffee several times.

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:08.541
So let's go out in the garden and see why

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.800
I'd always leave my mug sitting on top of a pole while I'm gardening.

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:12.881
I get carried away with gardening

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.281
and time I get back to it is always cold.

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:16.041
There's several features I like about this cup

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:17.401
that keeps my coffee hot.

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:20.281
And it even has a spout, so if I want to put some ice cold water in it,

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:21.161
it's easy to drink from.

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.201
Makes me think that my disabled mother would probably like this

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:24.341
to drink her hot tea in.

Check out all the cute colours I have.

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:30.541
I think I'm gonna order a pink one for my mum.
