00:00.080 --> 00:01.800
We had such a busy day today,

00:01.800 --> 00:04.100
so we ordered food.

00:04.440 --> 00:07.460
No, I did not cook anything from scratch today.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.880
We've been doing baby stuff all day long.

00:09.880 --> 00:10.640
Building cribs,

00:10.640 --> 00:11.520
doing the whole thing.

00:11.520 --> 00:12.680
So we ordered food.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.100
Obviously we ordered Thai food.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.580
So we got a few dishes.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.140
These are still piping hot.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.700
I think they forgot our rice bubs.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.180
No. So we got.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.220
What is this? Oh, okay.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.900
We got some plain rice,

00:32.960 --> 00:36.740
cause we got this little stir fry situation.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.020
We got some chicken basil stir fry.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.300
We got. Oh, this is what?

00:46.080 --> 00:48.640
This is such a tiny portion. Holy crap.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.300
I got mango sticky rice.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.960
Wait, is there rice in there? Yeah,

00:52.960 --> 00:54.400
I got mango sticky rice.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.660
This is tiny,

00:56.040 --> 00:58.000
but I've been craving it all day long.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.400
There's nothing better to me than mango and sticky rice.

01:01.400 --> 01:04.040
Then lucky got drunken noodles.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.100
Oh, my goodness,

01:05.440 --> 01:06.580
this looks so good.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.380
Can I have some of it? Yes, baby.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.860
Then I got this glass noodle stir fry.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.560
Lucky always orders food,

01:16.560 --> 01:18.840
and it looks better to me than mine.

01:18.840 --> 01:19.840
Mine does look the best,

01:19.840 --> 01:20.700
I'll be honest.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.740
So I usually get.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.860
I usually eat what he's eating.

01:25.560 --> 01:26.640
What else did we get?

01:26.640 --> 01:28.960
Oh, we also got a mango limeade.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.000
We usually get everything like medium spicy,

01:32.000 --> 01:36.140
but lucky always needs extra spice.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.760
Come on. He also eats everything with hot sauce.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.540
Do we plate this or do we just.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.320
No, let's just eat it out of the

01:43.320 --> 01:45.000
Container looks still really hot.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.420
We don't have to warm it up, right?

01:46.480 --> 01:48.420
Yeah. Let me just try it.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.020
Uh huh. It's good. Uh huh.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.680
Try. Good. I'm gonna try yours.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.820
Do you wanna turn on next level chef? Yes, I do.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.320
We don't really watch shows lately.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.160
Well, that's. No,

02:02.160 --> 02:04.620
we've been watching Love Is Blind, Babe. Oh yeah,

02:04.880 --> 02:05.840
we watch Love Is Blind.

02:05.840 --> 02:06.980
We're waiting. Iconic.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.100
We're waiting for the last.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.900
It is iconic, honestly.

02:11.640 --> 02:12.940
Uh huh. Uh huh.

02:13.320 --> 02:14.360
It's good. Yeah.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.420
So baby like it? Uh huh.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.360
Alright, baby loves,

02:18.360 --> 02:19.914
