00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
Well, reason for the call today,

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:05.201
John, is something just came across my desk.

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:08.801
John. It is perhaps the best thing I've seen in the last six months.

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:11.401
If you have 60 seconds, I'd like to share the idea with you.

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:12.150
Got a minute.
