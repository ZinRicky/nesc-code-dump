00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.120
One thing I've noticed after talking to my closest friends

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:05.521
is how they keep saying how I've changed

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.121
At first that kind of threw me off

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.521
but when I started thinking about it

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:10.241
it's actually a compliment

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.961
in fact I love that they've noticed

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:15.921
which has made me reflect a little on the inner work that I've been doing

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:19.281
I've completely rewired the way I think,

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:20.641
how I operate,

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:22.121
I've changed my living,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.641
I've even changed my identity

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:27.481
so here are the things that I've done to change my life for the positive

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:31.061
Before I always felt like I struggled with self sabotage

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200
I was toxic and unhappy

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:36.941
and it made me feel like I was living the life that I didn't deserve

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.360
so here's some of the things that I wish I worked on sooner

00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:43.041
number one establishing routine

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.081
your inner self loves routine

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:46.401
okay it's good

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:48.501
and it makes you feel stable

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.180
this will help build stability

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.300
and it'll make you feel safe

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.360
and obviously

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:56.641
everyday brings on new obstacles

00:00:56.642 --> 00:01:00.581
but building a firm routine will help put your mind at ease

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.720
your inner routine will just take over

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:04.961
like do you shower in the morning or in the evening

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:06.721
what are you gonna prepare for dinner

00:01:06.722 --> 00:01:08.301
if you have a routine

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.380
and you find what works for you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.460
you don't have to think about it because you built that routine

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.220
No.2 journaling

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.020
journaling has been huge to help with my anxiety and stress

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.200
basically I can just brain dump everything

00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:24.081
that's on my mind

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:27.041
and put it to paper so it's not stuck in my head

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:28.921
this helps me get things off my mind

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:33.521
and it also helps me not brain dump on friends or family members

00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:36.701
this allows me to process my own thoughts through journaling

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.540
now I don't journal every single day

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.680
but for the most part when I do

00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:44.641
I've noticed a big change in my mind

00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:46.941
and the way I can function throughout the day

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.440
basically when I put my thoughts on paper

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.341
my brain feels less busy

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.000
being self aware is so

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:54.441
so important

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:56.721
if you wanna see self growth and improvement

00:01:56.722 --> 00:01:59.441
No. 3 therapy

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:01.081
I know you're probably like oh geez

00:02:01.082 --> 00:02:02.481
therapy not for me

00:02:02.482 --> 00:02:03.361
and I understand

00:02:03.362 --> 00:02:05.821
I've tried multiple therapist

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.240
but you have to find the one that works for you

00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:09.681
you may think it's a waste of time

00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:13.681
but truly if you find the right therapist that works for you

00:02:13.682 --> 00:02:15.661
that's when you see real growth

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.560
it takes trial and error

00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:20.621
not every therapist or person are you gonna click with

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.960
and as exhausting as that sounds

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:25.481
if you wanna see real improvement of your life

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:27.021
it's gonna take work

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.820
this will help you get over your own roadblocks

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.640
and help heal your inner trauma

00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:37.381
No. 4 letting go of friends or bad habits that do not serve you

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.520
let go of people that aren't good for you

00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:41.161
and I know it's hard

00:02:41.162 --> 00:02:42.501
but you just have to

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.840
if you wanna improve

00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:45.121
the version of yourself

00:02:45.122 --> 00:02:49.441
you have to have to let go of the people that do not make you better

00:02:49.442 --> 00:02:53.401
the people you surround yourself with is very important

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:57.281
because you become the people who you surround yourself with

00:02:57.282 --> 00:02:58.561
maybe you have a friend

00:02:58.562 --> 00:02:59.761
a fun friend

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:02.581
who parties and doesn't take life seriously

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.920
you gotta let them go

00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:06.721
if you don't wanna continue down that path honestly

00:03:06.722 --> 00:03:08.961
you have to protect your peace

00:03:08.962 --> 00:03:11.261
and your future selves peace

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.600
I know it's hard

00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:13.841
but real growth

00:03:13.842 --> 00:03:16.201
and changing old habits is hard

00:03:16.202 --> 00:03:17.361
it's gonna be hard

00:03:17.362 --> 00:03:18.281
let go of the bad,

00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:20.241
to let the good into your life,

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:23.201
that's essential for living the best version of your life

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:24.561
so reflect on these things

00:03:24.562 --> 00:03:26.801
if you want to live the life you deserve

00:03:26.802 --> 00:03:27.801
and I'm curious

00:03:27.802 --> 00:03:29.241
do you do any of these things?

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.261
or what do you do?
