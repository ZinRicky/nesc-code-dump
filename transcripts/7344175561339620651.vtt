00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.460
the women that are telling you the trad wife life is amazing

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.160
are the little 22 year old 24 year old girls that just got in it themselves

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:12.721
I am literally just trying to be dead ass honest

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:15.681
being a trad wife really fucking sucks

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.661
I did it for 10 years

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.020
I got married when I was 26

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.351
I thought I knew everything

00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:24.006
oh my gosh it was the next days of life

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:25.426
college was over

00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:26.851
everybody was moving on

00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:28.681
everybody else was getting engaged

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.815
and getting married and getting jobs and moving away

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:35.054
and I had the majorest FOMO of my life

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.080
the guy that I had been dating for a couple of years was like hey

00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:41.461
do you wanna marry me and I was like um I guess so

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.360
I remember calling like every woman in my family to be like hey

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:46.721
how do you fucking know you're supposed to get married

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:47.321
like I don't

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:48.521
I don't I don't know what am I

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:49.321
what am I supposed to do

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:50.161
and they were like yeah

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:50.721
great good job

00:00:50.722 --> 00:00:51.401
congrats you know

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:53.561
I was like okay

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:55.081
I guess this is what I'm supposed to do

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:59.341
but it's it's not all that it's cracked up to be

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.920
like think of yourself when you're 10 years old

00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:03.401
and then when you're 15 years old

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:05.441
you really grow and change as a person

00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:07.181
then from 15 to twenty

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.060
well when you get married at 25

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.920
at 35 you might be a different person

00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:15.461
you know just having children alone

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.860
the gravity of that sometimes really falls on you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.600
and you see the world differently

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:24.921
and you do start to change some of the ideals and morals that you had

00:01:24.922 --> 00:01:28.341
you're gonna see the world through a completely different lens

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.080
so when you give up all of your autonomy to this other person

00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:36.701
and then start bringing other people into the world

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.620
you may set yourself up to be in a real shitty spot

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.060
and I'm saying that with 10 years experience

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.900
and now five years removed from that experience

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.660
I've got five years to look back and say

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.920
man I really

00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:53.961
I really fucked up

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:55.181
I should have stayed

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.080
and I gotta tell you

00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.081
the desire that I only wish I left sooner

00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:03.641
I only fucking wish I could have like

00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:04.681
healed faster

00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:08.101
but fuck I feel like I did a good job it's

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.660
so good luck
