00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
is it legalistic for women of God to not cut their hair

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:05.440
this is a question that I get asked a lot

00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:07.720
alongside the question of

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:11.140
is it legalistic for women to only wear skirts and dresses

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.120
and my answer is simply no

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:16.500
if you have a personal conviction to not cut your hair

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.200
or a personal conviction to only wear skirts and dresses

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:20.580
that's amazing

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.340
but what is legalistic is pushing that belief on other women of God

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.520
who have studied scripture and prayed things out for themselves

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:32.360
I know so many incredible women of God who cut their hair and wear pants

00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:34.840
and still carry a great anointing of the Holy Spirit

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:37.580
and that's because our identity is found in Christ

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.294
not clothing or material things
