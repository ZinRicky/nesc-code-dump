00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
If you're having some election day jitters,

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:05.441
like I know I am, just remember that this is not gonna be done today.

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:06.561
They're gonna recount.

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:08.761
There's no way that this is gonna be a one and done

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:10.481
counting of the ballots, okay?

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:13.521
So sit back, don't get too anxious about the results tonight,

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:16.721
because we are going through a recount no matter what, okay?

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:19.901
I think we all know that. So just sit back,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.920
breathe. If you've voted,

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:22.881
you've done your part.

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:24.921
If you need to take a little break from social media,

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:27.401
because you don't need to see the pundits and the people

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.641
and the talking heads going back and forth about what.

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:31.541
Just wait, just breathe.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.220
And if you need bottle wine
