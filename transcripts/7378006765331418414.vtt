00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.660
guess what I did tonight

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.700
I went on a date

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.940
we went to a concert

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.020
and guess how many children I have four

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.380
guess what I'm divorced

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.560
and now I'm a single mom

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.040
that means I take care of my children by myself

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:26.900
that has nothing to do with who I sleep with or things I do in my private time

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.060
I'm a single mom in that I singularly take care of all four of them children

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.700
and I still have a happy life

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.240
so this is just a reminder that you do not need to stay with somebody

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.680
just because you had children

00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:44.940
with them you can leave

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.320
you can find happiness

00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:48.160
and any man that tells you

00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:50.660
someone isn't gonna love you because you have children

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.280
that's the kind of man that should have never become a father in the first place

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:57.520
and wanted nothing to do with children in the first place

00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:59.600
because there are very normal men in this world

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.760
who understand children are a part of life

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:02.600
and now who cares

00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:03.640
we're all about that age

00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:05.360
that maybe kids are gonna be a deal

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:06.560
like part of the deal

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:10.020
so just make sure that you're happy
