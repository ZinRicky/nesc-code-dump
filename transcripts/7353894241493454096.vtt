00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.520
I'm just about to embark on a five day room renovation

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.570
but before I do that I'm just gonna quickly 

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.201
embark on a boat called the Ranui 

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:07.764
I don't get to go out with my husband 

00:00:07.765 --> 00:00:09.081
without the company of our three mutineers 

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:11.241
 very often and when we do get to go out

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:13.041
it's usually not to do shit this cold

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.681
so quick backstory but those guys that you can see hopping on the boat

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.201
are the one and only Australian

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:19.161
Brother sister duo Angus and Julia Stone

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:21.273
and they're pretty fkn iconic if you ask me 

00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:22.761
and pretty much everyone I know

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:23.281
seriously though

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:24.824
these guys are right up there with my 

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:25.961
favourite artists of all time

00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:29.281
anyway next month their new record Cape Forestier drops and to celebrate

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:31.241
we're being treated to an intimate concert on a boat

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:33.781
and I can't believe I just got to say that sentence out loud

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:44.205
ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:47.036
ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶

00:00:47.037 --> 00:00:54.694
ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶

00:00:57.132 --> 00:01:07.314
ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.833
And then we got to meet them 

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:16.005
And they were so nice 

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:17.841
And it turns out Julia loved cleaning as much as I do

00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:19.841
which made me literally forget my own name

00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:21.641
and I wish I was joking but no

00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:23.141
I'm just awkward like that
