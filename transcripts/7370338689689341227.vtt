00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.320
So I'm in the car with my husband,

00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:04.261
and I'm talking about the comments that I've been receiving

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.840
on a lot of the content that I've posted recently

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:08.321
about what's going on in Gaza

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:10.001
with Operation Olive Branch, etcetera.

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:13.321
And a comment that I've gotten a couple times from Jewish,

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:14.761
other Jewish people

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:19.381
are that I haven't spoken up in strong support of the hostages.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.400
And when I really sit back and think about it,

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:22.961
they're 100% correct,

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:27.061
I haven't. And as we go forward with these conversations on my page,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.640
100% of the reason that I haven't is for two reasons.

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:34.161
One, because the way the internet is handling this,

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:36.341
if you speak out about one group of people,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.240
regardless of if they are innocent civilians on either side,

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:40.541
you are somehow

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.200
aligning your allegiance with only one side of this conflict,

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:47.281
with the civilians on one side of this conflict.

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:49.441
Number two is blanket fear.

00:00:49.442 --> 00:00:50.841
And if you are a Jewish person,

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:53.161
you will understand this like generational trauma,

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:55.361
this trigger of fear of antisemitism.

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:59.321
And while I have been unpacking everything that's been going on

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:01.561
and learning a lot more about the issue,

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:04.481
the one thing that I've held firm in my belief,

00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:05.381
in my heart,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.680
deeply empathize and care about the civilians on both sides.

00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:12.741
And I should have spoken about the hostages sooner,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.080
because there is absolutely nothing anybody can say

00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:17.901
that could justify to me

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.700
stealing children out of their beds,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.880
taking young people celebrating At a music festival. Hostage.

00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:27.701
Civilians are not culpable in the actions of their government.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.800
Any action against civilians for a political gain is terrorism.

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:33.881
It just is.

00:01:33.882 --> 00:01:38.501
Which is why I don't support the blanket retaliation on Palestine

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.040
from Israel either.

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:41.721
When October 7th happened,

00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:42.441
I, like,

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:46.001
looked leapfrogged into the future on how this was gonna look,

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:49.521
and I knew that this was gonna come down to, like,

00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:50.901
good Jew, bad Jew.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.120
My fear of that has kept me from speaking out against, um,

00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:57.301
the taking of hostages.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.600
And my fear of the team mentality on all of this

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:04.401
has kept me from speaking about the people in Gaza at length

00:02:04.402 --> 00:02:06.941
as well. And I'm kind of over that,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.320
because in reality,

00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:10.121
if you care about civilian life,

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:12.401
you care about it on both sides.

00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:15.501
And I will help in the ways that I can,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.080
the people that I can.

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:20.361
But I truly believe that until, as a global society,

00:02:20.362 --> 00:02:23.081
we can get to a point where human life matters more than

00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:24.101
religion and politics,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.580
we're just gonna repeat this cycle over and over.
