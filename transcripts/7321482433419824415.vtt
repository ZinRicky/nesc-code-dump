00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.680
Thrift store finds at my local thrift store.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.920
First up, we have this tapestry,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.640
and then we have this radio slash turntable.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.240
Guys, I might go back for this next week

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.320
because it's just too good to pass up for only 50 bucks.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.840
My husband wanted this book,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.140
so we got that.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm also obsessed with anything geese

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.560
decor related. Lately.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.960
I would like to start a gallery wall in my living room,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.680
and I just. I don't know.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.420
There's just something about that painting that I liked.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.280
This came home with me for sure

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.040
because it's small and cute.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.800
Passed on this,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.240
but it was an excellent condition.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.600
And of course,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.480
I always have to survey all the quilts.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.600
I love all of them.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.040
This gun sacks dress haunts me each time I come here.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.000
I need to buy it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.760
I got my daughter this little people airplane.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.520
And then I also got towels to cut up and make

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.264
for replacing our paper towels.
