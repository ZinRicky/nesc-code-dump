What do we do with all the milk from our family dairy cow?

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:04.981
With family dairy cows and peak lactation,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.600
giving up to six gallons a day,

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:07.641
what do we do with it?

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:10.041
One of my favourite things to do with all the milk that we get

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.241
is to make butter. First,

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:13.521
I'm gonna strain the milk here

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:15.121
and then I'm gonna sit it in the fridge overnight

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:17.041
and let the fat rise to the top.

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:20.001
That fat is cream. I'm gonna scoop up the cream and I'm gonna blend,

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:20.761
blend, blend,

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:23.041
and then the fat molecules will pull away from the milk

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:24.781
and you'll get butter.
