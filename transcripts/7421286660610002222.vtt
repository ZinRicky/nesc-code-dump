00:00.040 --> 00:01.560
Is my last meal in Germany.

00:01.561 --> 00:04.321
I requested having some German schnitzel,

00:04.322 --> 00:06.761
and luckily everyone else was on board.

00:06.762 --> 00:10.461
We had a big family dinner at this little German restaurant.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.720
Lucky was in a silly, goofy mood today,

00:12.721 --> 00:16.081
which was probably all his excitement about the German food.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.881
My sister came, my parents,

00:17.882 --> 00:20.481
my brother, and I didn't even have to look at the menu.

00:20.482 --> 00:22.721
I knew exactly what I was gonna eat.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.641
They were so kind to bring lucky out.

00:24.642 --> 00:27.361
An English menu, had an alcohol free beer,

00:27.362 --> 00:29.281
and I had one of my favourite drinks,

00:29.282 --> 00:32.401
which is a malt beer. Before we all ordered our food,

00:32.402 --> 00:33.881
lucky and I had to get the, uh,

00:33.882 --> 00:35.561
schnitzel. Doesn't like mushrooms,

00:35.562 --> 00:39.281
so I got those. And we got a few other things on this side as well.

00:39.282 --> 00:41.481
Because I knew that that food wouldn't be enough for.

00:41.482 --> 00:45.641
Lucky. Also needed an obscene amount of lemons for his schnitzel.

00:45.642 --> 00:47.881
This food always hits the spot for me.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.201
I didn't love the salad. My dad ate it.

00:50.202 --> 00:52.121
And I tried some of my mom's steak.

00:52.122 --> 00:54.561
This is a Frankfurt classic herb sauce,

00:54.562 --> 00:57.761
so I dip my fries in it. Before I could even get through my meal,

00:57.762 --> 01:00.001
lucky was already onto the next schnitzel.

01:00.002 --> 01:02.881
We had about three before we all wanted something sweet.

01:02.882 --> 01:04.881
So we got some red current ice cream,

01:04.882 --> 01:06.681
chocolate pudding, Kaiser schman,

01:06.682 --> 01:08.461
which is a deconstructed pancake.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.636
Then it was time for us to go pack our bags.
