00:00.680 --> 00:03.460
This has been my favorite late night snack lately.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.120
It's way past my bedtime,

00:05.121 --> 00:06.721
but I needed a snack,

00:06.722 --> 00:08.401
so this is what I've been having.

00:08.402 --> 00:09.561
It's honey crisp apples.

00:09.562 --> 00:12.381
I slice them. Sometimes I take the skin off.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.920
They have to be cold.

00:13.921 --> 00:15.881
And then I made date caramel.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.561
You can also use normal caramel,

00:17.562 --> 00:18.281
whatever you want.

00:18.282 --> 00:19.401
I just soaked some dates,

00:19.402 --> 00:20.081
blended them up.

00:20.082 --> 00:21.161
It tastes like caramel.

00:21.162 --> 00:26.861
It's so good. And then I sprinkle some flaky sea salt on top.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.580
So this is what I do.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.220
Take my apple,

00:32.160 --> 00:34.660
get a good amount of caramel on it,

00:37.480 --> 00:39.260
some flaky sea salt.

00:44.000 --> 00:44.800
Wow.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.380
I also sometimes do this with bananas or strawberries,

00:50.800 --> 00:52.660
but apples are my favorite.

00:53.040 --> 00:58.620
There's something about the combination of apples and caramel.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.200
And the flaky sea salt is crunchy on top of it,

01:01.201 --> 01:03.350
but also it just tastes like salted caramel.
