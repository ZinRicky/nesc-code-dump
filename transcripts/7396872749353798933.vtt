00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.096
I've got about an hour before 

00:00:01.097 --> 00:00:02.400
I need to head out for school pick up

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:04.360
which always coincides with the time of the day

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:06.014
where I'm the most tired that I've ever been 

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:06.640
in my entire life

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:08.564
and I find that the only thing that helps me with 

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:09.680
that is a little snacky snack

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.040
I started by making a smoothie with some frozen banana

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:13.520
Ceres organics cacao powder

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:15.080
protein powder dates oats

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:15.888
ice and oat milk 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.600
And because I've got a major sweet tooth

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.040
especially at this time of the day

00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:20.200
I'm gonna need a little treat

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:22.632
all three flavours of the Ceres Organic Fudgy Bites

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:23.920
 are legitimately delicious

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:26.760
but today I'm going for the chocolate raspberry because it's my favourite

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.140
they decadent but also wholesome 

00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:30.440
because they made out of organic whole food ingredients

00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:33.400
but tasting them you wouldn't know it cause they do taste kind of naughty

00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:36.520
I think it's probably the rich chocolatey taste and the soft fudge centre

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:38.360
that's doing it it really does feel like a treat

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:39.480
but I know it's good for me

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:40.480
so I'm pleased about that

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:43.600
so I'm gonna do a little admin and enjoy my delicious moment of self care

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:46.260
before the chaos of the afternoon shift begins
