00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.880
When I was with my narcissist,

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:04.441
I remember I could pick up on all his weirdness,

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:05.961
like, all his red flags and all,

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:06.921
like, the things that, like,

00:00:06.922 --> 00:00:09.841
really made him unsavory to be around.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:10.961
But I was like, oh,

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:12.801
you know, you can write a lot of those things off.

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:14.001
And then when we went out,

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:14.681
like, in public,

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:16.121
to parties and stuff, I was like,

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:18.161
do other people notice what I noticed?

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:19.761
Like, I was always just really confused.

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:24.081
I couldn't tell. Do they pick up on his weirdness and I'm the weird one,

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:26.521
or am I the normal one and I'm, like,

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:28.281
legitimizing him because he's so weird,

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:30.421
but clearly he's with a normal person?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.920
And then when we finally left,

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:32.361
and I was, like,

00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:34.001
talking to some friends, and I was like,

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.721
you know, I kind of asked them that,

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:36.641
and they were like, oh, no,

00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:37.241
he. We.

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:39.761
Everybody could pick up on how fucking weird he is.

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:43.261
We just figured if you, you know, you're normal.
