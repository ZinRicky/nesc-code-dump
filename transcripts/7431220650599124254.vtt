What is something that you would trust more around your body

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:04.621
than a politician? A mosquito.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.220
Probably. A gynecologist named Chad.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.260
Ha, ha.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.720
And I'd take drowning over that.

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:12.961
A dark hole. A YMCA lifeguard.

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:15.121
A woman. Ha, ha, ha.

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:16.241
A bear. J D.

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:19.361
Vance with a couch. Free shark diving. Yes. Okay.

00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:20.001
Free shark diving. Yeah,

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:20.521
yeah, yeah.

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:21.441
You would take that over, like,

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:22.921
JD vans in your business? Yes. Yeah.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:23.401
What about, like,

00:00:23.402 --> 00:00:25.761
wearing a wet bathing suit for the rest of your life

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:27.441
and risking yeast infections forever?

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:28.941
Oh, yeast infections. Yeah.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.300
Gummy bears,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.860
my grandma. Anybody sitting at that table.
