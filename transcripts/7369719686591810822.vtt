00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
On a point of order during QP,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.180
the leader of the official opposition yelled across the way here

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.160
in respect of the leader of the federal NDP,

00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:18.181
and I quote, your leader can't even get back into his home country.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.740
There is no room in this chamber for xenophobic,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.180
racist,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.420
offensive comments towards anyone.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.660
Jugmeet Singh, for the information of the Official Opposition,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.780
was born in Canada. He is a Canadian citizen

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.340
and he is a kind and compassionate and caring

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.180
and brilliant and respectful Canadian citizen.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.340
I cannot just stand by while the leader of the official opposition

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.300
just spouts off disgusting rhetoric

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.740
to the leader of the federal NDP.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.500
I would ask that the leader of the official opposition

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.020
stand in his place and apologize

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.460
not only to everyone in this chamber

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.220
but to Jughead Singh himself.
