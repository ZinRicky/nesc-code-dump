00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.240
are you wanting to learn how to pressure can but you're worried about the safety

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:05.200
we've all heard stories of great Aunt Edith

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:09.700
who had a pressure canner blow up and cover the ceiling with spaghetti sauce

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.800
but how common is that and how do you prevent it

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:16.520
so home pressure canners were developed around the beginning of World War Two

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:21.040
but production was brought to a halt due to the war efforts and aluminum rations

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:22.120
after the war ended

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:25.780
demand for pressure cookers and canners skyrocketed

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.440
production boomed

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:30.960
but many of the pressure canners and cookers were low quality

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:35.340
introducing the flying lids and explosions

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.840
canners from the 50s had several issues

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:40.360
you can do your own research into the individual problems

00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:43.200
but the good thing is that by the 1970s

00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:46.520
they figured out how to fix the problems and improve the product

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:49.280
today's canners are made with safety measures and backups

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:52.500
to ensure that flying lids are a thing of the past

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.600
they're also tested rigorously for home safety

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:57.840
if the safety mechanisms are not engaged

00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.640
the canner will not even build a pressure

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:01.380
so what is the safest canner

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.040
basically any canner that's newer than 1970

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.760
my favorite pressure canner is a vintage one from the 80s

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:08.740
works like a charm

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.480
be sure to buy a reputable brand like Presto or all American

00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:14.860
don't buy a cheap knockoff and you'll be fine

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.720
