00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.280
So I have, like,

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.700
not been feeling well the last two days.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.940
I have a syndrome called POTS.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.840
Stands for postoral or stophatic tachycardia syndrome.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.440
I probably just slaughtered that.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.160
Here's the thing about syndromes.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.080
They're all BS.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.800
Like polycysco ovarian syndrome

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.920
and POT syndrome.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.600
It basically just describes or explains

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.920
what symptoms you have.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.520
It is not natural diagnosis.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.420
Just like sudden infant death syndrome.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.360
It basically means that my heart rate is

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.440
exceedingly fast

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.240
and that my blood pressure is very,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.840
very low. And it gives me horrific side effects.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.440
Sometimes I feel like I'm having a heart attack.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.160
I can't breathe.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm having anxiety or a panic attack.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.960
My legs will go numb.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.680
And if your blood pressure drops too low

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.760
or you have seizures.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.880
And because I'm carrying a baby

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.680
and my blood volume has tripled,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920
it has made my blood pressure drop even more

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.000
in my third trimester.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.620
And I had this issue in my first trimester.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.240
Are you telling us all this personal information, Holly?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.080
Cause now they believe that one in four women

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.560
of childbearing years suffers from POTS.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.280
And their significant studies

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.480
showing that it's all environmental.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.480
Because it's America.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.260
Land of the free and land of the sick.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.880
Almost every woman I know of childbearing years

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.160
has some sort of autoimmune or chronic illness.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.120
I went my whole 20s knowing

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.820
either have to get married

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.620
and let's look at our culture for that,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.200
or be self sufficient at home,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.600
where I Can make money

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.280
and not be forced to work outside

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.800
when I'm feeling deathly ill.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.520
That is why I do digital marketing.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.100
And so I can watch my baby.
