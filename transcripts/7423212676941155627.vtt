00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.680
a few days ago I asked

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:05.760
are there women out there who will refuse pregnancy to the extent they can

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:07.460
if Trump wins in November

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.660
this is the response I received

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.120
these are women who refuse to do reproductive labor

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:14.560
under a national abortion ban

00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:19.160
because they're fully aware that the maternal mortality rate is skyrocketing

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:24.220
that in Texas alone it is up 56% after their abortion ban

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.900
these are women who are justifiably afraid of becoming pregnant

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.120
needing care and being unable to receive it

00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:35.540
being told that we have to wait until you get worse before we can help you

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.320
we are unwilling to do reproductive labor

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:40.600
for a government that is forcing us to do it

00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:43.160
a government that is still going to push these policies

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:47.160
even though they know it will raise the maternal mortality rate

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.000
if they're going to make us do this

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:52.920
and they don't care that it could cost us our health and even our life

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:53.900
then fine

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.200
we won't do it and I see that I am not alone

00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:00.560
they are messing with the wrong people

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.112
and we will damn sure see them at the ballot box
