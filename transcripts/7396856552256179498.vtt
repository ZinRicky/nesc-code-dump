00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
This is a big moment. Dean has never,

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:03.921
ever had cinnamon chicken,

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:07.481
and nor have I ever made it before.

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.421
With a lot of assistance,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.880
but I think we've. We've gotten there.

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:14.281
It looks good. Yeah. No.

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:14.881
Oh, my god.

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.921
It looks fantastic. Smells amazing.

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:18.861
So should we try? We're about to have a big moment.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.860
Really good.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.380
Hmm. What do you rate it? Oh,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.680
you know, I'm thinking there's always room to go,

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:41.681
so I'm gonna give it, like,

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:44.461
an 8. I'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.600
but without knowing exactly what the range on this is.

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.181
So I'm thinking if we do this again,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.560
we can make it better. I'm not sure what we would do to make it better.

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:58.421
I think I am gonna put a little cayenne on it just to see,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.520
because, of course,

00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:04.021
that's the way I supposedly experienced it for the first time.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.640
I could probably put more on,

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.001
because I barely. Okay,

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.621
now I'm getting it in the aftertaste.
