Earlier this morning, when I wanted to shower,

00:02.161 --> 00:04.361
I realized that we ran out of soap.

00:04.362 --> 00:05.961
Luckily, a couple hours later,

00:05.962 --> 00:09.801
my husband landed back home and got straight into making me some.

00:09.802 --> 00:12.201
I struggle with eczema and sensitive skin,

00:12.202 --> 00:15.381
so today we went with a lavender oatmeal soap.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.200
In the meantime, he heated up some water on the stove,

00:23.201 --> 00:24.841
set his metal bowl over it,

00:24.842 --> 00:27.941
and let that melt while he started grinding up some oats.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.800
Once our soap base had melted,

00:29.801 --> 00:32.321
he poured half of it into a separate bowl

00:32.322 --> 00:34.361
before combining it with some lavender

00:34.362 --> 00:36.921
essential oil and some purple mica powder.

00:36.922 --> 00:40.021
He gave that really good mix until it was all combined,

00:40.040 --> 00:42.120
sprayed down the mold with some alcohol

00:42.121 --> 00:44.761
before pouring the soap mixture into it.

00:44.762 --> 00:46.901
While that was setting, he combined,

00:50.640 --> 00:54.480
giving that a good stir before adding some more essential oils into it

00:54.481 --> 00:57.681
and then pouring that on top of our purple soap base,

00:57.682 --> 00:59.441
topped it with some more lavender,

00:59.442 --> 01:02.781
and let that set for about four to six hours.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.220
Six hours? He cut it up into bars.

01:05.240 --> 01:06.640
All the bars we weren't using,

01:06.641 --> 01:10.041
I tied up before taking the other ones up to our shower.

01:10.042 --> 01:11.496
I'm so glad we're stocked up.
