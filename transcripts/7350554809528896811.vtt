00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.200
No gatekeeping here.

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.441
Happy to share the recipe.

00:00:02.442 --> 00:00:04.521
You preheat your oven to 400 degrees,

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:07.001
lightly toast some breadcrumbs in a pan with some butter,

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:09.401
and obviously boil noodles whatever shape you like.

00:00:09.402 --> 00:00:12.061
I like to grate my cheese fresh,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.040
so I work on that while the noodles are boiling.

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:18.961
And then making macaroni and cheese is a very simple ratio.

00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:21.381
It's for every tablespoon of butter,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.240
you add a tablespoon of flour

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.121
and then one cup of milk and then one cup of cheese.

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:30.601
Those are all the things that go together. And it's all the same number,

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:31.561
the same ratio.

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.581
1 1 1 1 or 2 2, 2 2.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.480
So you cook the roux down,

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:37.221
that's just the flour in the butter.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.080
Season it a little bit lightly,

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:41.421
cause this will be a good time to get the flavors

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.280
deep down in the heart and soul of your macaroni and cheese.

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:46.721
When you add the milk in,

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:48.441
add it very slowly at first,

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:50.041
otherwise it could get really clumpy.

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:51.281
You're gonna kind of wanna,

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:53.741
you know, you gotta mix it together nicely.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.440
You don't let it come to a boil.

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.381
Just when it starts to simmer and just start to bubble,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.260
pull it off the heat and then add in the cheeses.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.020
I added a white cheddar and then a yellow cheddar.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.880
And then save a little bit of that cheese

00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:10.141
so that after you get the noodles mixed up with the sauce,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.200
you can put some of That cheese on top.

00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:14.141
Cause we are gonna bake it in the oven.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.840
And here's the thing I love about these pans.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.461
When you put it in the oven,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.120
you can take the handle off

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:22.061
so you can really shove it in the back of the oven

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.700
and not have to worry about leaving room for the handle.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.480
So once you get all the cheese and the bread crumbs

00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:30.541
all evenly spread on top,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.360
you pop it in that preheated oven at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.081
And this was the final result.

00:01:37.082 --> 00:01:38.641
It is absolutely delicious.

00:01:38.642 --> 00:01:40.401
I kind of do think it tastes better the next day,

00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:41.321
but that's up to you.

00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:43.081
You decide if you want these pans.

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:44.501
They're LinkedIn the TikTok shop.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.760
They are amazing.

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:46.681
They're nonstick,

00:01:46.682 --> 00:01:49.281
non toxic. They're ceramic coated,

00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:50.681
so they're not Teflon,

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:53.381
they have no toxic ingredients.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.640
And look how amazing they clean out like nothing.

00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:58.061
Takes two seconds to clean.
