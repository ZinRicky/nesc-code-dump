00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.720
The funny thing about growing up is like,

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:06.301
even as you age, you don't feel like it. So

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.400
even though I'm about to be 42,

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:13.201
when I see like a 20 something year old girl,

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:14.201
I'm like, hey girlie.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:15.741
Like in my head we're the same

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.340
and we're not,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.840
but in my heart we're the same.

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:26.341
And I will never stop fighting for you.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.380
And there is something kind of cool about becoming an older woman

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.840
and seeing how you do get dismissed by society

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:40.341
and you do slowly become less and less relevant.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.980
You know, all the varying factors.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.920
But there's like a freedom and a power in that.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:47.521
Like, oh,

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:49.241
I'm gonna fight extra loud.

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:53.781
I'll be one of those fucking crazy old ladies screaming and fighting.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.320
I understand them now.

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:58.841
I remember when I was younger looking at them and being like,

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:01.981
what the fuck is wrong with that old lady with like purple hair?

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.500
And I'm so excited to be one of them.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.780
But we are never gonna stop fighting.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.580
We're never gonna shut up.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.960
I don't care that I got mine.

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:20.701
I don't care that I made it this far.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.540
I don't want my daughters and the younger girls

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.660
to not have those same opportunities.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.040
My heart is broken for the women that have already lost their lives

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:36.101
because of

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.260
some of these decisions.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.040
I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.620
don't know,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.140
I'm also scared and mad and angry. But

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.140
we're never gonna stop fighting.
