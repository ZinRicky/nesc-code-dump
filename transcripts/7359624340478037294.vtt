00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.880
Okay,

00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:04.781
I'm heading out with my family on a little family Friday day of fun.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.820
Look how cute this set is.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.320
Oh, my god.

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:12.321
With the scallop detail and the matching set.

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:14.401
Um, so I got this on TikTok Shop.

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:16.941
I haven't really dabbled in TikTok shop that much,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.320
but I saw this set,

00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:21.421
and I thought it was perfect for spring and summer here in Charleston.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.600
And I was right.

00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:23.561
And I got it in the Navy

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:25.921
because I don't have a ton of navy in my closet,

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.841
and we like to diversify,

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:29.581
but it comes in tons of colors.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.760
Look how adorable, though.

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:33.561
You could totally wear this, too, as, like,

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:35.241
just a pair of shorts over,

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:36.821
like, a bikini top,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.600
or you could, like,

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:40.381
throw it on over a bathing suit this summer,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.220
but with the little raffia sandals.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.740
Oh, my gosh,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.920
I feel so cute.

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:48.461
And the little scallop detailing. Come on.
