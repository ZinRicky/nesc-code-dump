00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.280
Recently, I've seen a lot of discourse about homeschool on the internet,

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:05.761
mostly fueled by the idea of unschooling,

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:09.161
or what if your kids are not really gonna be learning anything?

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:11.921
So I wanted to weigh in as a first time homeschool family,

00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:14.921
a mom who never thought she would homeschool her kids,

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:18.121
that homeschooling shouldn't be less on the parent.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.561
It's going to be more.

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:21.041
There are a lot of ways to do this,

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:24.721
but my ultimate goal with my kids was to give them a better education,

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:26.241
a more comprehensive education,

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:28.341
a more culturally diverse education

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.520
than the one they were gonna get at public school.

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:32.881
An education that is going to challenge them,

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:34.661
that is gonna broaden their horizons,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.440
that is gonna allow them to have some

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:38.641
control of the subjects that they learn

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:42.921
while still balancing advancing them in all of the course subjects,

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:47.241
meaning a full, comprehensive education in math, science,

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:48.881
ELA, and social studies.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.861
But the gift that it really gave me is the gift of time.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.960
I now get to watch their little eyes light up

00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:57.601
when they learn something new.

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:00.601
We get to explore a new subject together.

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:04.941
There are no field trip days, because any day could be a field trip day.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.480
My husband and I have prioritized our life in a way that

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:11.201
he has time when he takes it off of work,

00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:12.921
and I'm home all the time.

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:17.121
So we are able to constantly be teaching our kids.

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:19.761
Now Whether or not you believe in the UN school approach,

00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:21.361
I will tell you what we do.

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:22.901
I follow a curriculum.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.800
I outsource certain subjects to experts in the field.

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:31.361
We take trips and field trips and hands on learning very seriously,

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:34.481
and we allow our kids to dive into things that they're interested in.

00:01:34.482 --> 00:01:36.961
I think there are amazing things about homeschooling,

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.161
and if you're curious,

00:01:38.162 --> 00:01:39.381
you can message me.
