I wanna show you the trick that I Learned for poached eggs.

00:03.840 --> 00:05.840
Okay, so the trick is,

00:05.841 --> 00:09.841
I have water, half water,

00:09.842 --> 00:11.481
half white vinegar in this bowl.

00:11.482 --> 00:13.961
And then I cracked my eggs directly into this bowl

00:13.962 --> 00:15.601
and let them sit for 10 minutes.

00:15.602 --> 00:19.461
And you can see that they're kind of turning a little opaque color.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.120
So when they start to turn this color,

00:21.121 --> 00:23.721
you know that they are ready for your water.

00:23.722 --> 00:28.881
Get our ladle, and we're going to carefully get the egg yolk

00:28.882 --> 00:32.101
and egg whites into the ladle.

00:36.160 --> 00:40.500
See that the egg whites are staying around the egg yolk.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.760
Just get it out of the water,

00:42.761 --> 00:48.801
and you have a perfectly poached egg.

00:48.802 --> 00:52.541
Tiny bit of salt, little bit of pepper.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.280
We got some sourdough bread,

00:55.281 --> 00:57.701
and you have a perfectly poached egg.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.280
Where's the yogurt? Like,

01:00.281 --> 01:01.661
yogurt thing? Hmm.

01:03.080 --> 01:06.420
Spicy. I have it.
