00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.280
When I recently found out that my husband's

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.480
favourite pie is lemon meringue,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.920
I knew that I had to make him one.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.680
With only a few lemons left on my tree,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.000
I got to work immediately.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.400
I started by making a crust using an all purpose

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.600
eincorn flour that's bursting with nutrients and flavor

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.520
since it hasn't been stripped to stay soft stable.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.000
There's just nothing like a flaky,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.560
buttery crust.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.200
Which is why I won't be using a freshly milled

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.960
100% whole grain ironcorn for this one.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.240
I got two Crestwell Freeze

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.160
one for another pie.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.480
My chickens are laying eggs again

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.360
and you're not going to believe

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.240
how orange the yolks are.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.640
Which comes my commitment to raise them on fresh pasta

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.360
aka new backyard grass daily.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.880
I don't use cornstarch in my kitchen.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.360
Instead, the all purpose ironcorn

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.200
thickened up the lemon custard perfectly.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.160
After tempering the egg yolks with the lemon custard,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.000
I finished my pie crust by baking it with a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.240
layer of Parchment foil

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.520
and beans to keep from collapsing during the pre bake.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.040
The last step was to make my merengue,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.080
which was really fun to do

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.520
and I'm actually a new fan of meringue.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.760
This entire pie was very

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.120
lightly sweetened with maple sugar

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.760
and all of the ingredients are nutrient dense,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.600
mostly from my land.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.800
So when my husband took a bite

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.440
his first words were oh my gosh,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.060
this is the best one yet, honey!
