00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.520
hold my teeth

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:07.841
we're gonna talk about this

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:09.241
hello I'm Aria

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:09.921
I'm a tradwife

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:11.241
I've been married for four years

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:14.861
and let me tell you the two reasons why I think tradwives make food

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.880
that doesn't really look that great

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:20.101
first off most of us are married to blue collar men

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.400
and as a generalization

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.241
I'm not saying every blue collar man is like this

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:27.881
blue collar man like their casseroles and their canned green beans

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:29.681
I know this is true for my husband

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:32.601
because whenever I make him a casserole or make him something in a gravy

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:34.881
like beef stroganoff sort of thing

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:38.841
he loves it it might be the ugliest food I have ever seen in my whole life

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:40.561
but he loves it

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:42.521
and it goes on the list of we're making this again

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:45.161
my husband is okay if I make like

00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:46.841
fancier foods or like

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:48.221
international stuff

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.080
but it really does not go on that list of making this again

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:54.601
because it's a family favorite

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:56.201
the second reason is

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:57.641
this is not true for me

00:00:57.642 --> 00:01:00.661
but I suspect it's true for a lot of us tradwives

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.800
is that we were not raised in a traditional household

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.901
and we were not taught how to cook

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.000
so a lot of us are just out here trying to teach ourselves

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:12.001
learn from YouTube

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:13.081
Pinterest whatever

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:14.941
and just winging it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640
and we don't know how to plate food

00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:17.361
and we're just

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:18.281
we're trying our best

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:20.441
so those are the two reasons why

00:01:20.442 --> 00:01:24.421
I think that trade wives don't make like fancy food

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.055
let me know what you think in the comments
