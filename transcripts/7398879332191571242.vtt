00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.720
last week the kids and I finished up their Greek mythology unit

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:05.280
so we decided to end it with an ancient Greek feast

00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:06.440
now I love a theme dinner

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:08.520
this is one of my favourite things that I do with the kids

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.420
and it just so happened that they love Greek food

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.960
so this was actually my favourite one we've done in a while

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:16.720
I set the table in the colours of the Greek flag

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:20.040
and used busts and columns and gold

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:23.240
to kind of bring together this whole ancient Greek

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:26.800
opulent dinner we did about a week of a Greek mythology unit

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:30.640
starting with the chaos and the origin story of Greek mythology

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:32.900
then moving on to learning about the Titans

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.120
Cronus and Raya and the story of Zeus and the Titanami key

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:36.680
basically

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:40.780
Greek mythology is a perfect unit for kids who already like action and adventure

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.280
for dinner I made a spiced roasted lamb and a Greek Orza salad

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:46.640
and complimented all of that with pita and dips

00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:48.360
and the grape leaves and cucumber

00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:51.240
there was a little something for everyone and they all enjoyed the meal

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.320
had to have a little picture of Dionysus there

00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:56.520
I heard he got in a little bit of trouble at the Olympic opening ceremony

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.737
but he was a welcome guest at our table this unit was such a
