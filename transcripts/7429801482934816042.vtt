00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.760
so if you're looking into homeschooling

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:03.440
there are a couple different ways to go about it

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:05.600
and one of those ways is unschooling

00:00:05.601 --> 00:00:07.960
that's just a method of homeschooling

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:09.680
um unschooling

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.600
pretty basically is the idea of not doing any sort of

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.160
like institutionalized learning

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:17.340
curriculum learning or workbook type learning

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.040
the hypothesis is that kids learn from their environment and like

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.169
it's a much more freeform way of learning or teaching

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.329
um it's not something that I necessarily do or adhere to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.109
but I definitely see other people who do it and love it and get a lot out of it

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.909
um but my family actually does a hybrid of curriculum and unit study

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.629
homeschooling

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.829
which means for certain subjects

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.309
I have set curriculum and curriculum books

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.089
and we follow along on the schedule

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.479
and then when we need to shake things up

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.279
we do a unit study

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.732
which is basically accomplishing all of your core subject requirements
