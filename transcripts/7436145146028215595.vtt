Mimsy is seven months old now,

00:01.601 --> 00:03.601
which means we're prepping baby food.

00:03.602 --> 00:05.521
So here's a few basic things I prepped

00:05.522 --> 00:07.881
to make day to day life a little easier.

00:07.882 --> 00:10.001
I started by warming up some milk.

00:10.002 --> 00:12.201
Since we had a little bit of yogurt left over,

00:12.202 --> 00:14.641
I use that to start my new batch.

00:14.642 --> 00:17.321
I combined some of the warm milk with my old yogurt,

00:17.322 --> 00:19.401
stirred that in, cover that with my lid,

00:19.402 --> 00:22.321
and let that sit for seven hours in a warm place.

00:22.322 --> 00:25.561
In the meantime, I made a quick blueberry compote to go on top,

00:25.562 --> 00:27.921
and then moved on to making some bone broth.

00:27.922 --> 00:30.001
I had some bones left over in my freezer,

00:30.002 --> 00:31.921
so I popped those in the oven to roast,

00:31.922 --> 00:33.121
and while they were cooling,

00:33.122 --> 00:34.801
cut up some celery, carrot,

00:34.802 --> 00:37.321
and onion, added that to a heavy pot,

00:37.322 --> 00:39.361
and then added my beef bones on top,

00:39.362 --> 00:41.001
filling that up with filtered water

00:41.002 --> 00:43.921
and letting that simmer for about seven to eight hours.

00:43.922 --> 00:48.121
I also skimmed off all the gray foam on top for placing the lid on.

00:48.122 --> 00:49.921
I also like prepping some puree.

00:49.922 --> 00:51.201
So on this week's menu,

00:51.202 --> 00:54.161
we had some purple sweet potato and Butternut squash,

00:54.162 --> 00:56.301
as last week we had pea and mint.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.080
Once the vegetables are done roasting,

00:58.081 --> 01:00.521
I transfer them over to a food processor,

01:00.522 --> 01:02.441
added in just a little bit of thyme

01:02.442 --> 01:04.401
and some milk before blending it up.

01:04.402 --> 01:08.341
The last thing I prep are these vegan lemon chia pancakes.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.960
All Of my kids were allergic to eggs when they were younger,

01:10.961 --> 01:12.601
so I made these for all of them,

01:12.602 --> 01:14.241
and they absolutely love them.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.121
I added all my ingredients together,

01:16.122 --> 01:19.161
gave that good mix that off in some good butter,

01:19.162 --> 01:21.601
let those cool while I strain my bone broth

01:21.602 --> 01:24.041
and checked on my yogurt to give it a good mix,

01:24.042 --> 01:25.321
and we were done. Like,

01:25.322 --> 01:28.441
putting all my prep meals into glass jars over plastic.

01:28.442 --> 01:30.881
I also kept all the vegetables from my broth,

01:30.882 --> 01:33.841
cut them up and put them away as well for her to snack on.

01:33.842 --> 01:35.203
And this is everything we prep.
