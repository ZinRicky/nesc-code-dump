00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.560
the data actually shows that the

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:04.840
it is often the smart decision is to stay because staying

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:06.960
because leaving can be the most dangerous moment

00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:10.920
it is the most dangerous moment in a woman who is abused life

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.280
so if you look at even

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:15.140
you know women of color who are desperately affected by this problem

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.920
only make up 8% of the population

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:21.180
and yet make up one fifth of all homicide partner uh

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.600
victims so uh

00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:23.040
and actually

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:26.480
half of those women were killed when they tried to leave their abuser

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:28.720
so often it's not just a complicated decision

00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:30.206
it's a smart decision
