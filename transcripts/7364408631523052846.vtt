00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.200
Today, in attempting to avoid the responsible things that I have to do,

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:05.701
I decided to replant pots.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.000
There's plenty of other things I should be doing.

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.241
I have four kids I need to provide and work for,

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:12.801
but I decided to replant.

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:13.321
Possible account.

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:16.201
They say, like, this big guy,

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:17.781
he was falling over.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.100
This little guy just needed a bigger pot because he's growing.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.560
This guy needed to get out of the water he was propagating in.

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:26.161
And the pot is already too small,

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:27.661
but it better than water.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.540
And this guy was also falling over.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.840
And there's my computer where I should be working.

00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:35.301
But we have plants.
