00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.640
So for educational purposes,

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:04.261
here is how I process a chicken at home.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.960
This chicken just came out the plucker.

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:08.721
It's freshly unalived and I'm gonna start processing.

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:11.061
The first thing I'm doing is gonna take the legs off.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.320
I'm gonna let the knife do most of the work here.

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:15.241
I did put a little bit of pressure on this one

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:17.501
as some of them are a little bit stiffer than others.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.100
Then I'm gonna head and remove the skin.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.640
I did dip the chicken in 150 degree water

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.141
and this helps to remove the feathers and the skin.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.920
Gonna use the feet for some broth,

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.781
so I wanna make sure the skin is removed.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.480
Then I'm gonna remove the crop.

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:34.321
This bits kinda slimy and hard to grab hold of.

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:36.321
This is why we make sure the chickens don't eat

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:37.801
a few days before we process.

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:39.421
We don't want this full of food.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.360
This kinda acts like a chicken's stomach.

00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:43.001
This is where food goes to ferment

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.061
before it passes on down to the rest of the digestive tract.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.500
Then I'm gonna give this a firm pour

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.800
and it's gonna release from the internal organs

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.341
and then I'm just gonna snip it.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.880
Then I'm gonna finish removing the rest of the neck.

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:00.961
I'm gonna use these necks for chicken broth.

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:03.121
We don't waste them. The dogs actually like them as treats,

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:05.181
but we're gonna use them as broth.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.560
Then I'm gonna remove the tail and then make an incision.

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:12.181
And move away from myself and not poke inside the organs.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.260
Do not want to make any lacerations to the internal organs.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.280
And with a firm hand,

00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:22.661
I'm gonna remove all the internal organs and cut away the butthole.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.240
I'm very careful to do this.

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:28.461
I do not wanna make any lacerations into the digestive tract.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.600
Now, once I did that,

00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:32.281
I did grab hold of the lungs and rip those out.

00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:33.921
It's not necessary to remove the lungs.

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:35.261
And this is the heart.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.280
This one had a healthier looking heart.

00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:38.521
Some of them have been covered in fat,

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:40.921
as these meat birds are definitely ready to be processed.

00:01:40.922 --> 00:01:43.441
Here we have the kidney, spleen,

00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:47.301
liver, and we have the gizzards right here.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.920
And this chicken was a girl.

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:51.821
So this is the ovary that's producing the eggs.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.240
And the eggs were still starting to form.

00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:56.821
This is a young chicken, so she didn't lay any eggs yet.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.520
Then I'm gonna rinse off the third and package it,

00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:01.237
put it in the freezer, and it'll be ready to eat.
