Jacob and I are going to California this weekend

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:06.881
for a friend's wedding, and I'm so excited.

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:08.961
I love California. Personally,

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:12.001
this is my third time this year going,

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.281
and it's wild, because before this,

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:16.681
I literally never been to California in my life,

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.881
and now in one year, I've been three times.

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:21.641
That's just so wild and so fun.

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:23.881
So I'm gonna get my nails done.

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:25.761
I'm gonna change the color.

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:28.101
They just need a little refresh.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.960
I think I'm gonna stick with the fall colors, though,

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:33.801
because I think I'm just feeling it,

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:35.121
you know? I'm thinking, like,

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:36.841
chocolate, maybe,

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:40.921
or a really pretty autumn pumpkin spice feel.

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:42.741
I think that's what we're gonna go with.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.920
She did an amazing job. I love them.

00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:02.381
They look like pumpkin spice. They're so stinking cute.
