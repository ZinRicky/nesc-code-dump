00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.020
Hey bro, they're here, right?

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.800
Yeah, I just can't afford groceries anymore,

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:06.301
but it's fine. I've really gotten into dumpster diving lately.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.780
It's really been an adventure.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.400
Wait, seriously?

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:10.481
You can't afford food? Well, yeah,

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:12.801
prices have gone up cause of tariffs and deporting immigrants,

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:15.021
but it's all part of making America great again.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.560
You mean the same America where billionaires got huge tax cuts

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.061
and now you're out here struggling to eat?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.260
Well, billionaires investing more will eventually help us.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.060
Trickle down economics. Bro,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.780
you're literally eating out of a dumpster.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.000
Hey, I'm just doing my part, okay?

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:30.721
What about your job?

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:32.741
You got laid off because the company outsourced everything.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.920
Yeah, but I'm learning new skills.

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.881
Like foraging. You're eating out of dumpsters

00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:38.781
and literally picking berries to survive.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.960
Exactly. Living off the land,

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:42.901
just like our ancestors intended.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.620
And you're still voting for Trump?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.680
Well, of course.

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:47.141
Who else is gonna save this country?
