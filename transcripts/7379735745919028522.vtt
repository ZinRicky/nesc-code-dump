00:00.000 --> 00:01.160
You ever had a craving

00:01.161 --> 00:04.401
that you can't stop thinking about until you actually have it?

00:04.402 --> 00:06.481
I've been craving Boba for so long

00:06.482 --> 00:08.841
that I just decided to make it today.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.201
Combine some brown sugar and water,

00:11.202 --> 00:12.081
let that heat up

00:12.082 --> 00:15.941
before adding in some tapioca starch and black food coloring,

00:16.120 --> 00:18.720
and then return that to the stove until it thickens up

00:18.721 --> 00:21.481
before adding the rest of my tapioca starch.

00:21.482 --> 00:22.921
Once that was all combined,

00:22.922 --> 00:24.801
I poured it onto my counter

00:24.802 --> 00:27.961
and started kneading it until it all came together,

00:27.962 --> 00:31.201
then split my dough into just so it's easier to handle

00:31.202 --> 00:32.681
and rolled it out

00:32.682 --> 00:36.881
for cutting it in smaller pieces and rolling those into balls.

00:36.882 --> 00:39.321
You can make them as big or as small as you want.

00:39.322 --> 00:40.841
I made them a little smaller

00:40.842 --> 00:42.921
because I knew that they were gonna expand

00:42.922 --> 00:44.341
once I boiled them.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.080
My dough was rolled out into balls.

00:46.081 --> 00:48.601
I transferred them over to boiling water

00:48.602 --> 00:51.001
and let them boil for about 15 minutes

00:51.002 --> 00:54.321
while I got started on steeping my roybus tea.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.161
Right before my pearls were done cooking,

00:56.162 --> 00:59.401
I heated up some brown sugar and for them over.

00:59.402 --> 01:01.761
Once they were all coated in the brown sugar,

01:01.762 --> 01:03.281
I poured them into my glass,

01:03.282 --> 01:05.721
top them with some ice, and my roybis tea.

01:05.722 --> 01:09.841
I obviously needed a splash of milk, and this hit the spot.

01:09.842 --> 01:12.262
It was so much better than store bought Boba.
