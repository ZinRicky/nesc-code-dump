00:00.040 --> 00:02.560
Here's everything my toddlers eat in a day.

00:02.561 --> 00:04.721
Obviously, not every day looks the same,

00:04.722 --> 00:07.241
and I usually don't cook them any extra meals.

00:07.242 --> 00:09.481
They eat whatever lucky and I are eating.

00:09.482 --> 00:11.521
With that being said, for breakfast,

00:11.522 --> 00:14.681
they had some apple compote with some pumpkin pancakes.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.561
They love a good cup of tea in the morning,

00:16.562 --> 00:18.981
so I made them some tea midway through,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.680
and I got started on my pancake batter by combining some eggs,

00:22.681 --> 00:24.001
pumpkin puree, milk,

00:24.002 --> 00:28.381
vanilla, and maple syrup and pouring that into my dry ingredients.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.800
Plated that with the apple compote we made and some maple syrup,

00:31.801 --> 00:33.721
and they ended up having seconds.

00:33.722 --> 00:35.601
A little later, they requested a snack,

00:35.602 --> 00:37.881
so I cut up some salami, parmesan cheese,

00:37.882 --> 00:39.801
pistachios, and some pomelo.

00:39.802 --> 00:42.161
Since it was so gloomy and cold outside,

00:42.162 --> 00:46.081
I decided to make a lentil soup with some fresh roasted garlic.

00:46.082 --> 00:50.361
Focaccia had been rising for four hours before I popped it in the oven

00:50.362 --> 00:53.681
and finished off my lentil soup by adding some kale to it.

00:53.682 --> 00:57.161
Once the bread was done, I cut it up and it was time to plate.

00:57.162 --> 00:59.321
There's nothing better than a lentil soup to me,

00:59.322 --> 01:01.521
and the kids absolutely love it as well.

01:01.522 --> 01:02.601
But like every meal,

01:02.602 --> 01:05.161
it's always a hit or miss on whether they're gonna have it,

01:05.162 --> 01:07.441
but today they did not. Big snackers,

01:07.442 --> 01:10.481
so usually they don't have a snack between lunch and dinner.

01:10.482 --> 01:14.081
We also tend to have dinner at 5:30 or 6 So tonight

01:14.082 --> 01:15.881
I made something quick and simple,

01:15.882 --> 01:17.761
which was just a coconut milk,

01:17.762 --> 01:21.001
poached cod, sauteed my onions and chillies,

01:21.002 --> 01:23.121
added my coconut milk, some soy sauce,

01:23.122 --> 01:27.241
first sauce, and let my fish poach for about five to eight minutes

01:27.242 --> 01:30.401
before adding some spring onion and some cilantro.

01:30.402 --> 01:32.761
And then we were done. We plated up the rice,

01:32.762 --> 01:35.541
plated up the fish with some of that coconut milk,

01:35.560 --> 01:38.240
topped it with some lime. It didn't end up loving it,

01:38.241 --> 01:40.103
but they still had a decent amount.
