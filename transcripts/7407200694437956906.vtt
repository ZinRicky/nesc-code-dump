00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.560
so we're in the middle of reorganizing our entire house

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:06.880
we have literally moved the furniture from almost every room to a different room

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:09.240
and now every room has a different function

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:12.800
mostly because we wanted to get our sectional couch up to the playroom

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:13.880
so the kids could have it

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:15.600
and make it more of a TV room

00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:19.320
and we moved our toddler upstairs because he was in a downstairs bedroom

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:21.740
and now he's old enough to go up and downstairs by themselves

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.040
and all the kids stuff being upstairs just works better for us

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:26.600
so I already showed y'all our new home school room

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:29.320
but one of the things I'm doing is reorganizing my office

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:32.400
because it became the storage room for everybody else's crap

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:34.240
so this is where we are right now

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:36.200
it is still in an absolute state of chaos

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:39.280
my husband just built this rack for my loungefly backpacks

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:41.460
and I'm gonna show you the closet once it's all done

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.240
um but I have the kids back to school stuff I've got to get together

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.800
I've got to organise all their memory boxes

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.560
I have never had a place to put my kids

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:51.600
my mementos and stuff like that

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:52.880
so they're just all over the house

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:54.040
they're in different rubber maids

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.680
like they're not organised

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.360
so one big project I'm gonna do

00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:00.780
is organise every single thing that I have for them

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.680
and I'm gonna show you the whole process in another video

00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:05.640
because I have a really cool like

00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:08.200
organizational hack and I'm not an organized person okay

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.160
I can go into like

00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:11.000
manic episodes of organizing

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.040
um but if I don't have a system in place

00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.580
it's not gonna happen so we're getting a system
