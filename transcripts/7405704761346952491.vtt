When I started doing Slim's hair this morning,

00:02.401 --> 00:04.921
I realized that we were all out of hair gel,

00:04.922 --> 00:06.401
and when I brought it up to lucky,

00:06.402 --> 00:08.321
he said he would take care of it,

00:08.322 --> 00:10.521
so he started making us some hair gel.

00:10.522 --> 00:14.001
He started by pouring about three cups of water into a pot

00:14.002 --> 00:15.881
and then bringing it to a boil.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.761
Once the water hit a rolling boil,

00:17.762 --> 00:19.121
he pulled it off the stove

00:19.122 --> 00:22.661
and added three tablespoons of flax seeds to our water,

00:22.760 --> 00:25.080
then brought this back to a boil on the stove,

00:25.081 --> 00:26.521
giving it a really good mix.

00:26.522 --> 00:29.541
And once it became frothy and thick in consistency,

00:29.640 --> 00:32.120
he strained it through a fine mesh strainer.

00:32.121 --> 00:33.921
Once that mixture was in the bowl,

00:33.922 --> 00:37.161
he added some essential oils that would stimulate the scalp,

00:37.162 --> 00:41.241
like mint and Rosemary. He did about five drops each,

00:41.242 --> 00:43.081
made sure that was all incorporated

00:43.082 --> 00:45.921
before transferring it over to a glass jar.

00:45.922 --> 00:48.281
After it was cool enough to use,

00:48.282 --> 00:50.601
he decided to take over doing Slim's hair.

00:50.602 --> 00:52.721
So he scooped some of that gel out

00:52.722 --> 00:55.361
and applied it to his already wet hair.

00:55.362 --> 00:57.801
He worked all the way from the roots through the ends

00:57.802 --> 00:59.761
and then let his hair air dry

00:59.762 --> 01:02.461
and it left his curls looking really defined.
