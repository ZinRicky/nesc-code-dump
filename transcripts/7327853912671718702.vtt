00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.080
This mini tabletop

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.000
concrete fire pit from the TikTok Shop

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.200
is the cutest little detail to make any

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.980
at home date just feel a little bit more special.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.000
It doesn't require any special fuel or gasoline,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.040
and you don't use wood

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.240
so there's no smoke or weird smells.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.280
You just use regular household alcohol

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.180
that you probably already keep on hand.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.440
It is also safe for indoor use,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.600
and it does come with a metal tool to snuff out

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.700
the fire safely.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.560
There are plenty of ways to show someone you love them,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.080
and you don't need to spend a ton of money to do that.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.040
But you can add sweet little special details like this.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.140
I hope you enjoy!
