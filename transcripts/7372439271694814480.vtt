00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.920
Oh, don't worry.

00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:02.861
Society expects plenty from women.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.480
We're expected to age gracefully

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:07.241
but never let ourselves go work like we have no children

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:09.061
and parent like we have no job.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.160
They'll call the stay at home mother unfulfilled,

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:12.561
but the working mother selfish,

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:15.301
all while childless women are considered incomplete.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.280
Go chase that career, but never at the expense of a family.

00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:20.081
Think like a man if you wanna be successful,

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:22.221
but don't act like one if you wanna be liked.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.920
We're supposed to mother our husbands,

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:25.281
but never treat them like children.

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:27.781
And put out on demand, but demand respect.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.600
Married and miserable is better than single and happy.

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:32.001
Don't stay with an abusive man,

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.741
but never break up your family.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.240
Don't marry a bum for love,

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:37.641
but don't stay with a successful man for security.

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:39.401
Don't be dependent on a man for money,

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:41.741
but don't emasculate them by earning more.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.840
They tell us to embrace our sexuality,

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:46.641
but have some self respect and to care about our appearance,

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:48.421
but stop looking for attention.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.520
Just say no, but let him down easy.

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:51.881
Be aware of your surroundings,

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:53.301
but stop being so dramatic.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.760
Practice self love, but don't love yourself too much.

00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:59.066
Dream big, but stay small. And would you like.
