00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.540
Being a mother is literally life's promotion.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.880
Everyone says, oh,

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:08.321
my god, when you become a mother or a tried wife,

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:11.261
you lose all sense of self identity.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.360
That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life.

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:16.361
Because no one wants looks at a woman

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:19.261
working a corporate job for another man

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.920
100 hours a week and says, oh,

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.381
she's lost sense of herself and identity.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.720
When they get promotions and take on more work,

00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:28.281
or become someone's assistant,

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:32.001
or get other projects and they work overtime,

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:34.081
and they stop eating and they're high on caffeine,

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:34.961
no one ever says, oh,

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:36.841
they've lost their sense of self.

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.521
When they avoid their family,

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:40.121
their children, their parents,

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:41.241
no one says, oh,

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:42.521
my god, look at that boss babe,

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:44.201
she's lost her sense of self.

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:49.061
But for some reason, the minute you have children,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.900
everyone says, oh,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.480
it's so sad that you stay at home with your kids full time

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:56.201
because you've lost your sense of self.

00:00:56.202 --> 00:01:00.561
I have had 32 years, 30 when I first had a child,

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:02.921
to build a foundation of who myself was.

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:06.761
And now, because I selflessly care for them every waking second,

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:08.361
I've lost my sense of self.

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:09.981
No, that's offensive.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.760
I would argue

00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:14.581
women who work in corporate industries their entire lives

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.400
have never developed a sense of self.

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:20.121
Not everyone, but you get my point.

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:22.181
Talk about a biased narrative.
