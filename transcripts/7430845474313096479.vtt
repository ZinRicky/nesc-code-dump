PTSD breakfast is served. As a divorced woman,

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:09.781
I spent way too long of my life in a shitty relationship,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.100
and now I have chronic stomach problems.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.960
So just because you think you

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:15.681
you can. Oh,

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.361
I can tough it out with this guy,

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:19.961
it's not a good idea. You will pay for it later.

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:21.901
Here's my chia seed pudding.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.540
It's very globby,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.960
but it works. So.

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:29.901
To this globby mess of chia pudding,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.320
because it tastes like it's got the consistency of stuff.

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:39.681
I usually spit out a bunch of crunchy shit to it

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:44.701
so that it's not just mush. And I mean like a bunch.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.460
Okay. It's the consistency of something I normally spit out.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.860
Cause we're just.
