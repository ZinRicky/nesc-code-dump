This stuff, you put it on like a primer,

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.981
but it's made from Peter Thomas Roth.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.300
It'll firm up your skin while you're wearing it.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.700
I don't know if it has the same product in it,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.800
the same, like,

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.801
chemical thing that goes, like,

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:19.801
the woman, the really famous woman.

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:23.201
But I do think it does help your skin,

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:25.481
like, the texture of your skin over time.

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:26.961
And it says it does it over time.

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:28.441
I've been using it for, like,

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:31.721
a week now, and I do feel like when I use it,

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:33.701
my skin is a little more, like,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.740
Plumpy, Juicy.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.240
Nah, I don't know.

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:40.321
I don't know. I like it.

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:44.501
I got it, and it's linked right here if you want to, as well.
