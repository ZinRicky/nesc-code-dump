00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.200
No, this is happening right now.

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:05.681
An increasing number of Republicans are attacking no fault divorce.

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:08.321
They wanna make it harder to get a divorce,

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:11.121
70% of which are initiated by women.

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:12.961
The Texas and Nebraska

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:17.021
Republican parties put it in their state's official platform.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.600
And what I'm guessing you're trying to say is, yeah,

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.321
but Republicans will never actually make it harder to get a divorce.

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.561
Like, these bills would never pass.

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:23.961
This is never going to happen.

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:26.001
It is justified and warranted

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:27.301
and even necessary

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.680
that we react to the things that legislators say that they want to do.

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:32.921
Like, what's the alternative?

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:35.281
We only get to react when the deed is done,

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:38.441
when they do actually make it harder to get a divorce.

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:40.121
This type of thoughtless,

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:43.841
dismissive tactic was used so much

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:46.741
when women and feminists and activists

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.720
sounded the alarms for years and decades

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:51.921
that Republicans would overturn Roe v.

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:52.321
Wade,

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:56.721
only to be told time and time again that they won't actually do it.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.001
I certainly hope you're right.

00:00:58.002 --> 00:00:59.441
I hope this never happens.

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:02.461
But I plan to continue reacting to Republicans

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.185
when they tell me what they wanna do.
