00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.420
I'm a 22 year old Gen Z track wife

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.140
and I like to wear historically inspired fashion.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.400
But everyone on the internet keeps telling me

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.040
that I need to dress my age,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.040
that I look like a granny.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.360
So my followers helped pick out some outfits

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.020
and I decided to try it.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.680
I tried the straight jeans, sneakers,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.040
slick back hair,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.080
layered necklaces,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.260
a tank top, and honestly not a fan.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.400
Even though it was a fun experiment

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.200
to try something new,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.960
I think I'll stick to what makes me feel most

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.440
comfortable,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.100
and I hope that you'll do the same!
