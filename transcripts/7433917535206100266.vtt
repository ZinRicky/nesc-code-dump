Have you ever craved something late at night

00:01.921 --> 00:03.601
and even though it seems like a hassle,

00:03.602 --> 00:07.201
you just have to make it? I've been craving churros all day today,

00:07.202 --> 00:10.201
so I just decided to make some before going to bed.

00:10.202 --> 00:12.401
Started by making my caramel sauce

00:12.402 --> 00:14.601
by letting my sugar turn an amber color,

00:14.602 --> 00:16.801
whisking in some butter and heavy cream

00:16.802 --> 00:20.021
before transferring it over to my glass jar to cool.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.720
Then started on my churros,

00:21.721 --> 00:24.041
which was just some water, sweetener,

00:24.042 --> 00:27.641
some oil that I let come to a boil on the stove,

00:27.642 --> 00:28.761
and once it was boiling

00:28.762 --> 00:32.941
I pulled it off and added some flour before giving that a good mix.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.040
Set that aside and made my sugar cinnamon mixture,

00:36.041 --> 00:38.401
but I used monk fruit sweetener for this

00:38.402 --> 00:41.921
and then transferred my churro dough to this little gadget.

00:41.922 --> 00:45.961
Heated up my coconut oil for frying and then working in batches,

00:45.962 --> 00:49.121
up my churro dough into it until it was golden brown.

00:49.122 --> 00:52.761
While it was still hot, I gave it a good toss in the sugar mixture

00:52.762 --> 00:55.281
and repeated that with all of my churro dough.

00:55.282 --> 00:57.641
This little midnight snack hit the spot.

00:57.642 --> 00:59.241
A little crunchy on the outside,

00:59.242 --> 01:01.070
soft in the middle. Stunning.
