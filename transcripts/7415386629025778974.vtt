These night lights are a must if your kids are afraid of the dark.

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:04.801
They are perfect because they are a dimmable and motion sensor.

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:06.961
I got them to put in the hallway between my kids room in the bathroom.

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.561
I don't want a light that stays on all night,

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:10.881
but I also need a light so they're not afraid to go to the bathroom.

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:13.241
That's what makes these kin deep night lights so perfect.

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:14.441
I can set them to stay on,

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:15.961
I can set them to be motion sensors

00:00:15.962 --> 00:00:17.481
and I can control the brightness.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:18.121
I don't know about you,

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.401
but I don't wanna get up in the middle of the night

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:21.401
to go to the bathroom and be blinded by my night light.

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:24.281
I wanna stay half asleep so I can go back to sleep real fast.

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:25.761
So if you are anything like me,

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:28.541
grab yourself some of these night lights from the TikTok shop.
