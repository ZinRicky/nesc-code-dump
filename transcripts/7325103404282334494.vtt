00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.580
This is just a piece of paper

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.680
that means absolutely nothing.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.120
That is my bachelor's degree.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.360
Um, I graduated with honors.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.440
As to opens up a discussion on,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.600
does Education Equal Success or make you smart?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.880
Think everyone should be educated

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.560
and have a very rigorous education.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.280
But the matter of reality today

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.280
is that colleges are not a place of, um,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.600
rigorous education anymore.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.520
The saying when I was in college was these

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.380
get degrees,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.760
see, is get degrees.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.800
You can do bare minimum.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.720
As long as you're not failing,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.760
you can get your degree.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.440
Ask the question,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.480
do you need college

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.240
if you wanna be a traditional wife,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.720
a homie, etcetera?

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.760
I would say no.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.000
Now, if you wanna go into a field

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.240
where you actually do need a degree,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.440
like nursing

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.440
or what I was going for, um,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.200
or like, medical things, then, yes,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.400
there's a lot of things in college that you

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.960
don't actually need a degree for.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.440
College is a big excuse to party and live it up.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.000
And I think it is very detrimental in your young 20s

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.520
when you should be laying the foundation

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.440
for the rest of your life and being productive

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.000
instead of sleeping around on weekends

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.920
and getting belligerently drunk at bars.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.760
Anyways, don't let anyone make you feel bad

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.964
if you don't wanna go to college.
