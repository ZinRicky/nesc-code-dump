Here's everything I eat in a day six months postpartum.

00:03.121 --> 00:05.881
I obviously have to start off with a hot cup of tea

00:05.882 --> 00:07.961
and some protein powder. For breakfast,

00:07.962 --> 00:09.521
I was craving something sweet,

00:09.522 --> 00:12.241
so I made a German pancake for the first time.

00:12.242 --> 00:14.601
I don't know why these are called German pancakes

00:14.602 --> 00:15.841
because being from Germany,

00:15.842 --> 00:17.401
I've never seen them before,

00:17.402 --> 00:19.121
but I'm just gonna roll with it.

00:19.122 --> 00:21.681
Pop that in the oven for about 35 minutes.

00:21.682 --> 00:24.041
Once it was done, I cut myself a piece,

00:24.042 --> 00:28.161
popped it with some homemade apron jam and some fresh mixed berries,

00:28.162 --> 00:30.601
and this hit the spot. It was so good,

00:30.602 --> 00:33.261
but I still prefer the original German pancake,

00:33.360 --> 00:36.520
the little pick me up. I had a vanilla blueberry iced tea,

00:36.521 --> 00:39.041
then got started on making a baked salad.

00:39.042 --> 00:41.401
I wanted something fresh but still comforting

00:41.402 --> 00:43.161
since it is getting a little colder.

00:43.162 --> 00:45.801
I made some lemon pepper asparagus and kale,

00:45.802 --> 00:48.861
za atar chickpeas and maple harissa carrots.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.360
Pop that in the oven, fried up some prosciutto

00:51.361 --> 00:54.961
and in the same pan also sauteed some shallots and chili,

00:54.962 --> 00:56.481
and then it was time to plate.

00:56.482 --> 00:59.161
I topped everything with a miso lemon vinaigrette,

00:59.162 --> 01:01.961
gave that a good toss, and lunch was served.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.801
Is one of my favorite fall meals,

01:03.802 --> 01:05.601
and it comes together really quick.

01:05.602 --> 01:07.921
All I was craving today was comforting meals.

01:07.922 --> 01:10.281
So for dinner I made some lasagna soup,

01:10.282 --> 01:11.681
made some mozzarella cheese,

01:11.682 --> 01:13.721
moved on to making my pasta dough,

01:13.722 --> 01:14.921
and while That was resting.

01:14.922 --> 01:17.041
I diced up some celery, onion,

01:17.042 --> 01:19.881
and carrot. Once my sauce came together,

01:19.882 --> 01:23.601
I rolled out my pasta, cut it into regular shapes,

01:23.602 --> 01:26.161
and let that finish cooking in my sauce.

01:26.162 --> 01:29.241
Once that was done, I tossed in the mozzarella we made.

01:29.242 --> 01:32.041
At this point, I was starving and so hungry,

01:32.042 --> 01:34.761
so I plated it up, topped it with some Parmesan cheese

01:34.762 --> 01:37.761
and some spring onion. Even though I burned my mouth,

01:37.762 --> 01:40.401
this was so good. I always need something sweet,

01:40.402 --> 01:42.241
so I made some vanilla ice cream.

01:42.242 --> 01:46.511
Lucky made some cookies. After taking my magnesium, it was time for bed.
