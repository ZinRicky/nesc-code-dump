00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
My favorite thing about this new house

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:06.801
is that there's a blue jay that lives in the trees.

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:09.761
There's a ton of big, mature trees around my house.

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:11.461
There's a church across the street.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.220
They just have a bunch of trees and shit.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.140
And here's the thing,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.440
I. I will post the video.

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:21.601
I have a blue jay. Came to my bird feeder, like,

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.081
a couple days before I moved out of my old house,

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:25.121
and then now I moved here,

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:27.281
there's a blue jay. So it makes it feel like alignment,

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:29.821
because I'm feeling very shitty,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.620
very, um,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.800
super depressy. I don't know if it's, like,

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.761
summertime sadness. I know that's a thing.

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:39.801
I just remembered that, so maybe that's it.

00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:40.741
But, um,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.200
super feeling down lately,

00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:46.841
and then realizing that the Blue Jay was at my old house,

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:50.081
and then it's here. And because this morning,

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:51.801
the blue jay was squawking so loud,

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:54.281
I got up to see you. Is there a problem?

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:57.181
And it was a blue jay. And I was like, oh,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.180
it was like, what a way to start my day.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.320
Unarudi! Februari!

00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:14.756
Februari! Februari! Februari!
