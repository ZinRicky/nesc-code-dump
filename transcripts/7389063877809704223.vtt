The really great thing about femininity is that if you are a female,

00:03.441 --> 00:05.521
you already have it deep within you.

00:05.522 --> 00:08.561
It is in your DNA. It is in every part of you.

00:08.562 --> 00:09.841
I'll get comments from women saying,

00:09.842 --> 00:12.361
can you give me tips on how to be more feminine?

00:12.362 --> 00:13.641
Because I've never been like that.

00:13.642 --> 00:14.841
It's just not me. Again,

00:14.842 --> 00:17.161
the truth is that you already are that.

00:17.162 --> 00:21.641
But our current society does not praise or value femininity

00:21.642 --> 00:22.961
in a lot of cases. And so

00:22.962 --> 00:26.761
I think a lot of us grew up believing that we needed to act masculine

00:26.762 --> 00:29.801
in order to be valued, in order to be respected.

00:29.802 --> 00:32.921
And we kind of built this hard shell around ourselves.

00:32.922 --> 00:36.041
So you just have to figure out how to shed off that layer.

00:36.042 --> 00:38.801
I think the number one way is to nurture.

00:38.802 --> 00:42.601
That really is the core and really is the essence of femininity.

00:42.602 --> 00:46.601
If you can just find someone or something to take care of right now.

00:46.602 --> 00:49.641
Today, I find that is when I feel my most feminine.

00:49.642 --> 00:50.321
For a lot of women,

00:50.322 --> 00:53.601
that is simply being more intentional about raising your children.

00:53.602 --> 00:55.601
Really turn it into an art.

00:55.602 --> 00:58.401
Having a morning routine, teaching them things,

00:58.402 --> 01:00.521
snuggling them, being warm with them.

01:00.522 --> 01:02.361
If you have a partner or a spouse,

01:02.362 --> 01:03.321
you can really, again,

01:03.322 --> 01:06.041
be more intentional about how you care for them.

01:06.042 --> 01:09.121
Be the soft place to land when they come home from work

01:09.122 --> 01:10.961
or whenever you get To see them.

01:10.962 --> 01:12.681
And even if you don't have a significant other,

01:12.682 --> 01:15.221
there are plenty of people and friends you can nurture.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.840
Even nurture a pet, like,

01:16.841 --> 01:19.161
even watering and caring for plants,

01:19.162 --> 01:20.681
like that is nurturing.

01:20.682 --> 01:23.441
And that is going to really bring out your femininity.

01:23.442 --> 01:25.201
And that does not make us weak.

01:25.202 --> 01:29.881
That is actually a very, very powerful strength that we have to take.

01:29.882 --> 01:33.161
Humans and animals, make them feel safe and loved.

01:33.162 --> 01:34.621
Mommy! What, baby?

01:35.520 --> 01:38.400
Again, there are so many other things that you can do to kind of

01:38.401 --> 01:41.721
feel more feminine, to shut off that masculinity that I, again,

01:41.722 --> 01:42.401
society, I feel like,

01:42.402 --> 01:44.841
has just incentivized us to have.

01:44.842 --> 01:45.921
But I think the first step

01:45.922 --> 01:49.581
and the biggest thing anybody can do right now today is to nurture.
