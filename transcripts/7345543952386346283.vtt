00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.240
My gym just increases prices.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.880
So I got this new home wave home gym.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.100
It has all these attachments.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.240
This thing is basically a push up board

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.780
and you can put it in the different color coded spots

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.840
to condition in different areas,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.920
like for chest

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.480
or for more shoulders or triceps or whatever.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.040
So you have all these different options.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.320
It also comes with a sheet

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.740
so you can see what exercises you can do.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.760
And there's no fear when you're doing the exercises

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.520
because all the little carabiners have safety latches

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.760
so it's not gonna come undone.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.500
It feels really safe and secure.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.760
I am really excited to kind of

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.640
have my own little home gym set up

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.280
because I'm not trying to pay the prices for the gym

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.600
and I never have the time to make it.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.760
If you want one for yourself,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.040
the link is right here.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.960
I highly recommend

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.351
and I absolutely love this thing.
