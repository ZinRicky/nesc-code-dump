00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.140
Are you okay?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.680
I'm definitely in a loving,

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:07.701
committed, long term

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.780
monogamous relationship with a partner for like two years now.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.620
And after some conversations and multiple metrics to look at,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.980
we decided to move in together for multiple reasons.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.080
And we're maintaining healthy boundaries between everybody

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:33.901
because this is a mixed little village going on here.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.280
And that should not bear any weight

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:41.881
on women's decisions to stay in their marriages.

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:46.041
I'm not married. I'm not gonna get married if there's no common law,

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:47.581
nothing going on here.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.240
So everything I'm saying is absolutely factual.

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:52.601
Leave your shitty marriage.

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:54.481
Do not stay because you have kids.

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:57.041
Don't stay because you have kids cause you're like,

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:58.881
well, nobody else is ever gonna want me.

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:01.161
I'm never gonna be able to find somebody to be with me.

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:04.841
No, that's not even true at fucking all.

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:07.641
For every man that talks shit about single moms and shits on them

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:08.521
and blah, blah, blah,

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:11.241
there's another man right behind him ready to pick you up,

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:13.601
take you on a date and help you out in whatever way they can.

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:16.201
They don't give a fuck. It does not even fucking matter to them.

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:18.381
They see your value as a human,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.600
and they don't see children as a repellent.

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:24.101
So I stand by everything I said.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.280
If you're in a marriage and you're unhappy,

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:27.481
you should get out. If you're.

00:01:27.482 --> 00:01:30.241
Especially if you're in a traditional marriage where you even.

00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:32.441
If you signed up for It even if you're the one that was like, no,

00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:34.401
I chose this, this is what I wanted to do.

00:01:34.402 --> 00:01:36.881
You can choose something and then later decide like, oh,

00:01:36.882 --> 00:01:38.561
I think I don't like this,

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:40.561
you know, you can stop eating a meal like,

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:41.281
oh, actually,

00:01:41.282 --> 00:01:42.741
I'm not gonna finish that.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.720
You can leave a movie early.

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:46.641
Same shit, just a little bit.

00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:49.621
Just some different logistics is all I'm saying.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.560
Having children with somebody

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:54.281
does not mean you need to stay in a relationship with them.

00:01:54.282 --> 00:01:57.581
Just because you got married does not mean you cannot get divorced.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.400
Divorce is not the end of the world.

00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:00.841
You can move on, you can live life,

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:03.841
you can be happy. And it does seem scary.

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:05.601
Yes, it seems super scary.

00:02:05.602 --> 00:02:08.141
Cause it's the unknown, you know?

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.160
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't,

00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:12.241
you know? It's easier to stay where you're comfortable,

00:02:12.242 --> 00:02:13.061
you know?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.520
But it's just new, that's all.

00:02:15.521 --> 00:02:17.081
Our brains are just, um,

00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:19.001
conditioned to be scared about new.

00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:20.401
See? But you can do it.

00:02:20.402 --> 00:02:22.161
That's why people like me post online,

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:23.481
to show you you can do it.

00:02:23.482 --> 00:02:26.521
You can totally leave and it's gonna be rocky

00:02:26.522 --> 00:02:29.021
and there was gonna. It's a fucking journey.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.840
But you can do it. Cause if I can do it,

00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:34.921
you can do it. If all the other women posting online.

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:36.601
That's why all of us are doing it.

00:02:36.602 --> 00:02:38.121
Just a little echo chamber of all of us. Like,

00:02:38.122 --> 00:02:38.801
hey, girl,

00:02:38.802 --> 00:02:42.681
we're out here doing it. We're out here doing it to show you.

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:46.881
So just because you chose a traditional marriage and chose that life

00:02:46.882 --> 00:02:49.801
doesn't mean you can't choose something else for yourself and say,

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.261
you know what? But I matter, too,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.960
and you can be an amazing mother.

00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:53.901
And in fact,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.700
leaving my marriage caused me to become a much better mother.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.820
And the relationships I now maintain

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.400
keep my motherhood at the forefront,

00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:07.781
since that is the most important thing to me in my life right now, so.
