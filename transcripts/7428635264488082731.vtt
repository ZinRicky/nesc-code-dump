00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.960
I had major brain surgery when I was 14 years old

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.181
for a condition called Chiari malformation.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.120
And they went into the back part of my head,

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:09.841
and they removed two inches of my skull and my first vertebrae

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.381
to give my brain more room.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.880
And after that brain surgery,

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:17.061
I was diagnosed with a very long list of conditions,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.300
including POTS, fibromyalgia,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.560
and a condition that has to do with my spinal cord,

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:25.541
with fluid flowing into my spinal cord.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.680
I have personally noticed since being diagnosed with POTS and pepper

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:30.281
my algae,

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:35.401
that in the colder months and when fall comes and winter is here,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:39.661
I struggle the most. Some of the symptoms are extreme fatigue,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.800
dizziness, half of your extremities being hot,

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:44.601
half of your extremities being cold.

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:47.841
That happens to me a lot. Getting really hot easily.

00:00:47.842 --> 00:00:49.581
Getting really cold easily.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.080
My fiber,

00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:53.601
my algae also gets a lot worse when I'm not sleeping very well.

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:56.381
And if I don't get at least eight to 10 hours,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.040
my body is, like,

00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:59.441
not doing great with it.

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:02.481
What's crazy is that I remember when I had brain surgery,

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:06.301
my neurosurgeon said that I needed to be sleeping 12 hours,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.520
12 hours a night. And after my brain surgery,

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:12.481
I was sleep up to 16 hours a night.

00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:15.761
I say all that to say that if you have autoimmune issues

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:17.121
like POTS or fibromyalgia,

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:20.521
I just wanted to share some tips that I have implemented in my life.

00:01:20.522 --> 00:01:22.121
That have made a difference.

00:01:22.122 --> 00:01:23.521
This is not medical advice,

00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:25.421
this is just some things that have helped me.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.600
Starting off strong with No. 1 turmeric.

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.661
I take turmeric every day.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.160
You have to be careful with turmeric because if you take too much,

00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:34.161
it can be really hard on your gut.

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:37.081
But it has made a world of a difference for me.

00:01:37.082 --> 00:01:39.881
I just can't be popping ibuprofen every day

00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:43.261
and this has helped lower my inflammation a lot.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.580
The next thing in these colder months is the sauna.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.360
I actually have a at home portable sauna.

00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:52.361
And using the sauna three to five times a week

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:56.361
during the colder months makes a huge difference for me.

00:01:56.362 --> 00:01:58.981
And my pain and my energy levels

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.660
and just the warmth of it all has really made a difference.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.200
And then the last thing that I just wanna say,

00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:06.721
and this might sound redundant,

00:02:06.722 --> 00:02:09.801
but just eating warm foods and drinking warm drinks.

00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:13.001
So I. I am a avid matcha drinker.

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:14.781
I don't drink coffee a lot.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.480
I stay on matcha because of the pots and matches.

00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:22.601
A lot more level when it comes to the caffeine levels.

00:02:22.602 --> 00:02:24.441
And I just feel a lot more stable with it.

00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:27.641
And it has made a huge difference in my life.

00:02:27.642 --> 00:02:30.501
And I like to drink it hot in the mornings for fall and winter.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.160
And I also eat a lot of soups and drink a lot of broth.

00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:39.541
And those things have helped me

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.240
And while these are not cures by any means,

00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:44.961
they could potentially help you manage your symptoms.

00:02:44.962 --> 00:02:48.421
Again, not medical advice. Just what has helped me
