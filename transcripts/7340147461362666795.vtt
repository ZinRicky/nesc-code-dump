00:00.080 --> 00:00.800
Okay, here is

00:00.800 --> 00:03.120
the unconventional way that I mop my floors.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.680
You're gonna need a full size bath towel.

00:05.680 --> 00:06.560
So what I like to do is

00:06.560 --> 00:09.080
whenever a bath towel start getting thin and just, like,

00:09.080 --> 00:10.040
old and warm,

00:10.040 --> 00:10.760
they retire

00:10.760 --> 00:12.360
and they become my cleaning towels.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.520
And then I'm gonna fill up my kitchen sink.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.680
I just love using my sink because it's really deep,

00:16.680 --> 00:17.440
it's really big.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.680
It's perfect for this.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.840
And I do make sure that I steam and sanitize it

00:20.840 --> 00:22.000
every time I'm done cleaning.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.080
You can use a bucket if you have one that's big enough.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.560
So I'm gonna fill it with really warm water,

00:26.560 --> 00:29.000
and then I'm also going to add a little bit of dawn.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.320
Sometimes I'll use other things, like.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.360
I love this method,

00:31.360 --> 00:32.040
squirt and mop.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.920
I also love this product.

00:33.920 --> 00:34.840
I ran out of it,

00:34.840 --> 00:37.180
but anyway, today we're gonna do Dawn.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.660
And then you take it

00:45.520 --> 00:49.260
and you pluck it down on the ground and step on it,

00:49.400 --> 00:50.540
and you start mopping.

00:50.600 --> 00:51.320
So when I'm doing it,

00:51.320 --> 00:52.080
I'll do just, like,

00:52.080 --> 00:52.880
a little area,

00:52.880 --> 00:54.480
and then I'll actually flip it over,

00:54.480 --> 00:55.920
do another little area,

00:55.920 --> 00:58.800
and then I'll go ring it out. And, um,

00:58.800 --> 00:59.960
after I run it out twice,

00:59.960 --> 01:01.320
I'll refresh the water.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.280
So it really kind of depends on how, like,

01:03.280 --> 01:05.520
big your house is or how dirty your house is.

01:05.520 --> 01:06.440
I have two kids,

01:06.440 --> 01:08.880
so my house does get messy a lot.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.640
And I do mop A lot.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.880
And every two weeks or so,

01:11.880 --> 01:13.360
I'll do my floor trifecta,

01:13.360 --> 01:14.960
where I will sweep the.

01:14.960 --> 01:15.840
Sweep everything,

01:15.840 --> 01:18.480
and then I will mop everything with the towel,

01:18.480 --> 01:21.160
and then I will use my steamer and steam everything

01:21.160 --> 01:23.540
just to make sure it is nice and clean.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.960
So, yeah, that's how I mop my floors.

01:25.960 --> 01:26.960
That's how my mom taught me to do.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.360
That's how my grandma did it.

01:28.360 --> 01:29.880
And I thought it was interesting to see.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.720
Probably half the people in my comments of

01:31.720 --> 01:34.560
the original video told me that they did the same thing

01:34.560 --> 01:36.400
and that their mom did the same thing,

01:36.400 --> 01:38.920
and the other half had never seen it done before,

01:38.920 --> 01:40.840
and it was totally shocking to them.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.280
So kind of an interesting thing.

01:42.280 --> 01:43.760
I've tried normal mops.

01:43.760 --> 01:44.640
I've tried swiffers.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.160
I've tried all of those things.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.440
I just feel like they kind of gross me out

01:48.440 --> 01:49.040
just hanging there.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.200
This way, when I'm done mopping,

01:50.200 --> 01:52.680
I just throw my towel into the washing machine,

01:52.680 --> 01:55.100
and it just feels fresh and clean. Um,

01:55.600 --> 01:56.379
and it works.
