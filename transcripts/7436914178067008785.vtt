00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
so I got vox popped and it's gone viral

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:05.920
I'll tag Connor below but there are threads

00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:10.320
talking about whether me and my boyfriend are arguing in the vox pop

00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:13.360
and talking about whether or not he's a Trump supporter

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:18.360
it's so funny to me so we're having this exchange and um

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.720
he asked me do you wanna go first

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.300
and I just launch into absolutely as a woman

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.000
men should shut the hell up about it

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.860
and he just steps aside and the camera just pans towards me

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.040
it comes across really harsh and intense

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:35.160
but people are getting their knickers in and on about it

00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:39.620
so I just wanna set the record straight on this interaction

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.580
is my boyfriend a Trump supporter

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.720
hell no he said

00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:45.360
as a woman you should go first

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:49.240
you should speak on this he said that in order to make a point

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:53.920
he didn't let his ego get in the way of making a feminist point

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:57.680
we both knew that it was for the camera and we both knew it was theatre

00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:01.200
and we both know that a lot of the time politics is theatre

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:04.720
so this was all to make that point

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.000
we know each other so well

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.320
he knew what I would do I knew what he would do

00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:10.000
neither of us is upset or offended

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.740
and we've been cackling about it

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.440
people are saying oh

00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:13.640
they've argued about this

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:16.340
like her boyfriend must be a Trump supporter

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.160
um you know

00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:19.040
you can just tell they had an argument about it

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:24.560
um we've had discussions about it and we're both completely on the same page

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:27.480
he is a complete socialist

00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:31.140
so he doesn't really like most people in politics

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.120
but in terms of Trump he knew that as someone with a uterus um

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:39.560
my views were a little more poignant

00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:42.440
and a little more relevant in this particular case

00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:44.020
and he didn't need to be asked twice

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.180
he stepped right aside and I wouldn't expect anything less of a man

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.880
of a man I choose to be with

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:52.660
he knows that in the moment

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.720
my anger at saying shut up

00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:56.800
was directed towards Trump

00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.840
and towards the men on the internet

00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:03.080
has been saying horrific things on behalf of survivors

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.520
and on behalf of women and trans people everywhere

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:09.780
he knew my ankle was directed at that situation and not at him

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.960
he's disgusted that Trump was elected

00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:18.120
he's disgusted by what's been happening on the internet

00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:21.100
and he wholeheartedly supports everything that I said
