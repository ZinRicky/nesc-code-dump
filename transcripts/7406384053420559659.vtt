00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
List of reasons why.

00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:04.361
I think the passport bros have actually figured it out.

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:05.721
Starting off with number one,

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:09.121
they're looking for traditional women who value family.

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:10.201
Men, other cultures,

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:12.761
other countries put family first

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.841
above their needs, above anything else.

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:15.881
Family is very important.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.601
There's nothing wrong with a man who values family

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:19.441
and wants to find a partner who also does.

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:23.081
For two, women in other countries are often very feminine.

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:26.441
They let the man lead. A man will value a feminine woman.

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:30.401
Three. Women in other countries actually very educated.

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:33.721
The huge misconception that women in other countries are poor,

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:36.281
uneducated, that couldn't be further from the truth.

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:38.041
Nothing better than having a partner

00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:40.481
who is equally as intelligent as you are.

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:44.441
Number four, these men are seeking women who know how to cook.

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:47.041
Cook for the family is one of the most important things.

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.201
Family dinner time, sitting down together,

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:52.321
space it. Most men don't wanna go eat fast food every day.

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:54.561
They want a woman who cooks for them,

00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:56.721
who takes care of them and the family.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.121
Passport bros simply just want a soft,

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:02.001
feminine, traditional woman who will cook,

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:04.343
who's intelligent. I don't know. What do you guys think?
