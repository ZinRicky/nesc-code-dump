00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
I think it's been really interesting to see how shocked

00:02.601 --> 00:03.761
people are by the term

00:03.762 --> 00:07.321
tried wife and how they seem to think it's some new way of living,

00:07.322 --> 00:10.121
like it's some unprecedented new trend.

00:10.122 --> 00:12.561
Have you seen these millennial and Gen Z girls?

00:12.562 --> 00:14.361
They just wanna be at home with their kids.

00:14.362 --> 00:16.601
They wanna have husbands and they wanna take care of their husbands.

00:16.602 --> 00:18.961
They wanna cook and they wanna clean and they wanna wear dresses.

00:18.962 --> 00:19.921
It's insane,

00:19.922 --> 00:22.961
when in reality, it's literally like the oldest lifestyle in the book.

00:22.962 --> 00:25.361
Before this, they were just called stay at home moms,

00:25.362 --> 00:27.161
and before that, they were just called women.

00:27.162 --> 00:31.041
But now our society has gone so far in the feminist direction

00:31.042 --> 00:32.561
that anybody who wants to live, like,

00:32.562 --> 00:34.121
a little bit old school and a little bit like,

00:34.122 --> 00:36.521
how women used to live is fringe, right?

00:36.522 --> 00:38.241
Like an extremist.

00:38.242 --> 00:39.841
And I just think about how so many of us,

00:39.842 --> 00:41.001
since we were little,

00:41.002 --> 00:44.801
we were raised in this kind of boss, babe, feminist society that told us,

00:44.802 --> 00:46.761
you can be so much more than just a mom.

00:46.762 --> 00:48.681
You can be so much more than just a wife.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.521
And so many of us listened, and we,

00:50.522 --> 00:54.201
you know, tried to climb corporate ladders and we boss babe so hard. Now,

00:54.202 --> 00:54.961
like, we're,

00:54.962 --> 00:56.481
we're a little bit boss babed out.

00:56.482 --> 00:59.121
And some of us wanna go a little bit more back to our roots,

00:59.122 --> 01:00.241
to our ancestors,

01:00.242 --> 01:02.721
to the women who came Before us. And live a little bit more,

01:02.722 --> 01:04.761
you know, like they did call us crazy.

01:04.762 --> 01:06.761
But we like babies.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.121
We wanna have babies.

01:08.122 --> 01:12.141
We wanna spend the very few years that we have of them being little

01:12.360 --> 01:13.840
with them. We like cooking.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.121
We like running a home.

01:15.122 --> 01:17.701
We like supporting our husbands and having good marriages.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.960
And, yes, we also appreciate cute dresses,

01:19.961 --> 01:21.841
the audacity. So call them tribe wives,

01:21.842 --> 01:22.921
call them stay at home moms,

01:22.922 --> 01:24.241
call them whatever you want.

01:24.242 --> 01:28.001
But just know that no matter how much you try and push the career

01:28.002 --> 01:31.281
and the boss babe and the feminist lifestyle onto women,

01:31.282 --> 01:32.981
there will always be women who naturally

01:33.000 --> 01:34.500
want a more traditional lifestyle.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.047
Just like the billions of women who came before us.
