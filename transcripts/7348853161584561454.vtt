00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.320
You've stayed in a relationship for that long,

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:04.841
there's a couple things happening in your brain.

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:06.441
And I feel like if you understood this,

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:07.841
that'll make it easier for you to leave.

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:09.041
Not talking to you like you're stupid,

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.501
I'm talking to you like I fucking care, okay?

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.260
There's this thing called the sunken cost fallacy,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.120
and it's the idea. We're like,

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.961
well, fuck, I've already spent 10,

00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:20.401
15 years, I might as well stay.

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:21.881
Like, that's kind of what happens at,

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:22.921
you know, you're one too.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:23.321
You're like, well,

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.001
it's been. It's only been a year or two,

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.601
you know, I don't wanna give all that up.

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:28.001
Let me, like, keep trying.

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.281
And then you keep trying for one or two more years,

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:30.681
and then you're like,

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:33.281
well, fuck, it's been four or five years,

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:34.101
you know,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.680
let me see if things can change, maybe,

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:38.281
you know, and you continue.

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:40.041
And that's one of the ways you get to 15 years.

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.221
So at a certain point you need to say,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.320
it doesn't. I am just continuing to,

00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:47.441
you know, pour water in a bucket with an.

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:48.521
With an empty bottom,

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:49.161
you know what I mean?

00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:52.401
You have to reconcile the sunken costalis and realize, okay,

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:53.881
it's only. It's been 15 years.

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:55.581
Do I want it to be 20?

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.160
You know what I mean?

00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:58.121
You gotta start making that good in your head,

00:00:58.122 --> 00:01:00.321
cause this is really just a mind game.

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:01.961
It's mind over matter.

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:03.681
Like, you can do it,

00:01:03.682 --> 00:01:05.881
Like, you've done hard things,

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:06.961
you can do this.

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:11.081
The other big mental game that is going on is change.

00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:12.321
Your brain doesn't like, change.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.761
Like, this is science.

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:15.081
I'm not talking about feelings,

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:17.701
I'm talking about fucking science in your brain.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.520
Your brain just doesn't like, change anything different.

00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:22.481
You know, the path of least resistance.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.321
I'm already here.

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:24.761
It's our. This is how we do things.

00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:25.721
I know what life is like.

00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:27.201
Like this. I don't got to figure shit out.

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:29.161
Like, we got plans,

00:01:29.162 --> 00:01:30.441
we always go in the summertime,

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:31.121
blah, blah, blah.

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:33.081
You know, you got this fucking routine that you're used to.

00:01:33.082 --> 00:01:36.001
So your brain is just gonna automatically be like,

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.761
oh, yucky, I don't wanna make new neural pathways,

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:40.041
I don't wanna do that.

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:41.561
Cause that's what your brains gonna have to do,

00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:44.261
is gonna have to figure a lot of shit out.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
But I feel like once you know those two things,

00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:50.201
and then you really examine your feelings

00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:52.521
and then you really think about what do.

00:01:52.522 --> 00:01:54.641
Okay, here's another big one to really think about.

00:01:54.642 --> 00:01:56.601
Like, what are you waiting for?

00:01:56.602 --> 00:01:59.981
Because the end of this is death,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.920
you know what I mean?

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:03.521
Like, you give him another 5,

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.321
10 year, who knows what's gonna happen?

00:02:05.322 --> 00:02:07.441
The end. What are you waiting for?

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:09.601
There's no like, finish line.

00:02:09.602 --> 00:02:10.521
There's nothing,

00:02:10.522 --> 00:02:10.921
you know what I mean?

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.441
It's like the more you stay,

00:02:13.442 --> 00:02:15.081
the closer to death you are.

00:02:15.082 --> 00:02:16.521
And then like, the less Energy.

00:02:16.522 --> 00:02:17.841
You're gonna have to, like,

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:20.721
do shit. So, like. Hmm.

00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:21.201
You know what I mean?

00:02:21.202 --> 00:02:22.481
When you start to just, like,

00:02:22.482 --> 00:02:23.201
logically, like,

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:24.681
take your feelings away from it.

00:02:24.682 --> 00:02:26.041
We gotta learn how to, like,

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:30.961
separate thought and feeling so that you can make a fucking decision,

00:02:30.962 --> 00:02:32.976
because you got it all jumbled up right now.
