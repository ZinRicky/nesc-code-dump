00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.880
I am the only person who knew how much danger I was in

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:05.641
and nobody would believe me.

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:08.961
This is the wildest story of fucking abuse

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:11.941
and someone being let down by everyone around them.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.400
Everyone around them and how she got through it.

00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:18.341
It's the love story between birds poogake and Linda Riss.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.880
They met in 1957.

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:24.301
While Bert was not a good looking man,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.520
he was awkward and weird.

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:27.861
He was also 10 years older than her.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.680
When he meets her,

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.201
he like instantly falls in love

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:32.421
cause she's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.080
He's just like going crazy.

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:36.121
She looks like Elizabeth Taylor.

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:37.761
Just. She's kind of annoyed with him.

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:41.041
Like literally they meet and he sends her a dozen roses to her house.

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:44.721
So he like comes on strong and hard real fast from the jump.

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:45.561
He was an attorney.

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:46.521
He was also like,

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:49.641
he helped produce movies or he had just been overseas in Europe.

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:53.441
The average income at that time was about $4,000 a year.

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:55.521
That was like what the average person made.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.561
He was making about $80,000 a year back in the 50s.

00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:00.221
So this dude was.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.000
Had a lot of money.

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.121
He was an attorney,

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:02.881
he was powerful,

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:03.601
he had connections.

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:06.081
He owned a nightclub in the area where like,

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:10.441
Johnny Mathis and like, people of the time would go and perform

00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:12.161
and he would walk in with her

00:01:12.162 --> 00:01:14.441
and as soon as they walked into the club,

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:16.361
he made Sure. That the band always be.

00:01:16.362 --> 00:01:18.321
The second you see me walking in with her,

00:01:18.322 --> 00:01:20.441
you play this fucking old song. Linda,

00:01:20.442 --> 00:01:24.201
her name. So every time she walked in, it was this huge grand entrance.

00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:26.681
Like, talk about fucking love.

00:01:26.682 --> 00:01:29.041
Bombing the fuck out of her.

00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:31.521
Because financial security is literally

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:32.961
one of the most important reasons

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:33.881
a woman looks for a man

00:01:33.882 --> 00:01:34.641
in those days.

00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:35.761
She was, she fell for it.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:36.601
She's like, alright, cool,

00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:38.801
I'm down. The grandmother's like, you know what?

00:01:38.802 --> 00:01:40.001
How the fuck is he single?

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:41.501
He's 10 years older than you.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.280
How did somebody not snatch him up already?

00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:44.601
This is. This isn't true.

00:01:44.602 --> 00:01:45.281
He's like, yeah,

00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:47.401
I knew that she found out, so I beat her to the chase.

00:01:47.402 --> 00:01:48.161
I was like, yo, listen,

00:01:48.162 --> 00:01:49.261
I'm married,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.880
I want to get a divorce,

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:51.361
blah blah blah.

00:01:51.362 --> 00:01:53.341
He's like playing her along,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.640
literally future faking.

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:56.921
He's like, no, I'm gonna leave her,

00:01:56.922 --> 00:01:57.561
I'm gonna leave her,

00:01:57.562 --> 00:01:58.361
I wanna be with you,

00:01:58.362 --> 00:01:59.361
blah blah blah.

00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:00.761
Linda's like a pretty stand up woman.

00:02:00.762 --> 00:02:01.681
She's like, I don't wanna do it.

00:02:01.682 --> 00:02:03.821
I don't wanna be with somebody who hasn't. Wife,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.880
when you get a divorce,

00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:05.841
hit me up and I'm gonna.

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:06.801
I'm gonna do me.

00:02:06.802 --> 00:02:08.201
The next day he's like, look,

00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:09.321
I got the papers.

00:02:09.322 --> 00:02:10.461
Her not being an idiot,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.120
she writes down the fucking divorce number that he gives her.

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:13.841
But looking at it,

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:14.921
I mean, it looks like real paper.

00:02:14.922 --> 00:02:18.161
So she's like, I mean, you Are an attorney.

00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:20.441
Like, I've seen you do big,

00:02:20.442 --> 00:02:21.641
powerful things.

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.681
Maybe it's possible the back of her mind,

00:02:23.682 --> 00:02:25.201
she knew she could get that shit checked out.

00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:27.961
Weeks go by and she's still dating him.

00:02:27.962 --> 00:02:28.881
She's falling in love.

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:29.901
She's like, wow,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.760
this is amazing.

00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:32.401
Like, okay,

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.641
he really did get the divorce.

00:02:33.642 --> 00:02:34.861
He did it. Like,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.360
okay. Like,

00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:38.361
this is awesome.

00:02:38.362 --> 00:02:39.921
She's. She's falling for it.

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:41.481
No, he's still fucking married.

00:02:41.482 --> 00:02:44.161
She's like a fucking done.

00:02:44.162 --> 00:02:44.921
I'm done with you.

00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:46.121
I'm done, done, done, done, done.

00:02:46.122 --> 00:02:48.161
She goes, has a hot girl, summer.

00:02:48.162 --> 00:02:49.521
She finds a new man,

00:02:49.522 --> 00:02:51.161
and her and Larry get engaged.

00:02:51.162 --> 00:02:53.001
And she's gonna be happy and everybody's happy.

00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:54.281
And she's in love, and he's in love,

00:02:54.282 --> 00:02:55.261
and this is great.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.280
And she has a big,

00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:57.741
beautiful engagement party.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.640
And the morning after her engagement party,

00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:00.321
the doorbell rings.

00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:01.701
She's getting ready for work.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.240
Her mommy answers and says, oh,

00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:05.321
somebody's at the door with a gift for you.

00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:07.381
It's. It was an engagement party gift.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.460
So they call her to the door,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.840
she's still getting ready for work,

00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:12.401
tying her hair up in a bow.

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:14.161
And she walks up to the door like, yeah,

00:03:14.162 --> 00:03:15.281
but, you know, so excited.

00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:18.241
And the guy throws lie in her eyes.

00:03:18.242 --> 00:03:18.881
But literally,

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:21.061
even as she's healing in the hospital,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.320
Burt is like, I'm so sorry.

00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.161
Cause he was the one who paid to have this attack done to her.

00:03:25.162 --> 00:03:26.281
He decided like,

00:03:26.282 --> 00:03:27.401
well, if I can't have Her,

00:03:27.402 --> 00:03:29.321
nobody will. I don't know what the goal was,

00:03:29.322 --> 00:03:33.521
but he went to her dad asking for his help to get Linda to be with him.

00:03:33.522 --> 00:03:34.161
And the dad was like,

00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:36.121
well, you're too late, cause she already started engaged to that guy.

00:03:36.122 --> 00:03:37.381
We at the party yesterday,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.600
she could see the red flags.

00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:40.701
She even says,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.160
I am the only person who knew how much danger I was in,

00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:47.501
and nobody would believe me. Like,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.560
he just wouldn't leave her alone.

00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:53.261
So that's when he fucking attacks her with a lie.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.680
Once he knows, like,

00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:55.481
oh, she's engaged,

00:03:55.482 --> 00:03:56.441
there's no chance.

00:03:56.442 --> 00:03:57.201
And he even said,

00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:58.241
if I can't have her,

00:03:58.242 --> 00:04:02.181
nobody will. And I'll make sure nobody even wants her if they could.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.960
And sure enough,

00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:05.881
he went through with that fucking threat.

00:04:05.882 --> 00:04:09.001
Because abuse does not ever deescalate.

00:04:09.002 --> 00:04:11.701
That shit gets worse and worse and worse and worse.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.880
She does participate in the trial to get him arrested.

00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:15.281
1857, when they first meet.

00:04:15.282 --> 00:04:18.781
1959 is when she's attacked.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.320
it's only fucking two years that this guy gets to this fucking point.

00:04:22.321 --> 00:04:26.541
In 1961, that's when he was finally found guilty and sent to prison.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.760
And she begins a new life.

00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.861
The resilience and the strength

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.100
and the independence that this woman showed through this horrific

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.340
event

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.680
is amazing. She meets this dude,

00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:41.601
he's like, I love you,

00:04:41.602 --> 00:04:42.241
I wanna be with you,

00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:43.041
I wanna meet, I wanna.

00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:43.801
I want you to be my friend.

00:04:43.802 --> 00:04:44.641
Like, I Wanna do this?

00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:45.321
I wanna marry you.

00:04:45.322 --> 00:04:48.241
Let's go. So she reveals her face,

00:04:48.242 --> 00:04:49.081
her eyes to him.

00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:50.221
This guy rejects her.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.500
And I'm. That was just a little bit too much for her.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.300
So she goes home and she's just like, uh.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.380
So by 1971, she is living alone.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.780
Her eyesight's worsening

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.600
and she's no longer the independent person she once was.

00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:08.201
Homeboy Burt is still harassing her from jail. Because he's an attorney,

00:05:08.202 --> 00:05:10.681
he is even starting lawsuits against her,

00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:12.421
like, suing her for shit,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.600
just to force her to respond.

00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:18.321
So she's forced to interact with him for all these years.

00:05:18.322 --> 00:05:19.401
Like, it never stops.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:24.241
His harassment and abuse of her never fucking stops.

00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:26.721
Even after the attack and after he's sent to prison.

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:28.681
So now she's finally like, it's.

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:29.601
It's worn her down.

00:05:29.602 --> 00:05:33.861
She does not have anyone really loving or supporting her,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.080
including her friends,

00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:38.121
cause all of her friends are moving on. By 1973,

00:05:38.122 --> 00:05:39.241
he reaches out to her,

00:05:39.242 --> 00:05:40.121
she says something funny.

00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:41.941
She says, show your good faith,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.800
you know, send me some fucking money.

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:49.621
This is a man with the utmost need for power and control.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.980
In two weeks, he sends her $4,000.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.840
So this woman is blind, disabled.

00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:57.861
All her friends are busy getting married and living their own lives.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.960
Like not one of them gave a fuck to try to, like,

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:02.361
support her, be there for her.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.701
No women empowering women. Back then, it was like,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.380
bitch, I got mine.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.160
And then it was just, peace out on you.

00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:09.441
Like, I got my man,

00:06:09.442 --> 00:06:10.941
you're stuck without yours.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.320
So imagine somebody sends you a check for like,

00:06:13.321 --> 00:06:16.821
you know, basically like 80% of what your annual salary is.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.280
She's like, okay.

00:06:20.281 --> 00:06:21.721
She hated him so much,

00:06:21.722 --> 00:06:23.641
even after sending her that much money,

00:06:23.642 --> 00:06:25.081
she wrote to the prison board and was like, look,

00:06:25.082 --> 00:06:26.521
he fucking is still harassing me.

00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:28.041
He sent me a check for $4,000.

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:29.321
Not only is he in there charge again,

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:30.361
but for policy making, fucking.

00:06:30.362 --> 00:06:30.921
You know what I mean?

00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:32.981
She tries to get him in so much trouble.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.740
You know what the fucking Parole board does?

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.620
They're like, did you really fucking send her that money?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.080
If we let you out,

00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:39.621
would you continue sending her money?

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.120
He's like, yeah,

00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:42.041
if I have it, sure.

00:06:42.042 --> 00:06:43.621
I give her whatever I can.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.520
They're like, okay.

00:06:44.521 --> 00:06:47.501
They released him. September was when he sent her the check.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.360
By March of 74,

00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:50.441
he was paroled.

00:06:50.442 --> 00:06:52.641
For 14 years in prison,

00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:54.161
this man harassed this woman,

00:06:54.162 --> 00:06:57.081
and then he's finally released her friends that were like,

00:06:57.082 --> 00:06:58.081
I don't wanna help take care of her.

00:06:58.082 --> 00:06:59.161
I don't wanna help take care of her.

00:06:59.162 --> 00:06:59.761
She needs a man.

00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:00.701
She needs a man.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.240
They fucking arrange to have her meet him and give Bert another chance.

00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:06.601
Like, well,

00:07:06.602 --> 00:07:07.801
he proposed marriage, and like,

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:10.901
I bet, like, maybe something will happen, she gets back together with him.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.880
She even said like,

00:07:11.881 --> 00:07:13.601
well, I Know I love him,

00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:15.461
I just don't like to use that word.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.520
She's saying, I wanted him to fucking right.

00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:21.401
You can see the anger and disdain for him as she talks about him

00:07:21.402 --> 00:07:22.281
in those moments.

00:07:22.282 --> 00:07:26.001
1996, he's accused of the same thing again.

00:07:26.002 --> 00:07:28.921
A woman comes out and accuses him of the same thing.

00:07:28.922 --> 00:07:31.021
And his fucking threats to her were real.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.240
He's telling her,

00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:33.321
you know what I did to my wife?

00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:34.281
I'll do it to you.

00:07:34.282 --> 00:07:35.441
And what does Linda do?

00:07:35.442 --> 00:07:37.601
This is when I'm like,

00:07:37.602 --> 00:07:38.921
okay, you're a stupid bitch.

00:07:38.922 --> 00:07:40.361
And this is where you become complicit,

00:07:40.362 --> 00:07:43.721
because she's literally defending him.

00:07:43.722 --> 00:07:44.761
Knowing everything that.

00:07:44.762 --> 00:07:47.481
I mean, she literally cannot see if she's defending him.

00:07:47.482 --> 00:07:49.441
And she stayed with him until her dying day.

00:07:49.442 --> 00:07:51.541
She died at 75 years old,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.760
still married to him.

00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:54.621
It's wild. She even says,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.580
cause they show little clips of them and they're kind of bickering and.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.400
And she just nitpicks at him and it just.

00:07:59.401 --> 00:08:01.261
It does look a little bit miserable.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.200
And she even says,

00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:03.621
well, this is what he gets.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.400
I feel like this is a little bit of his punishment.

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:06.681
This is a little bit of my revenge.

00:08:06.682 --> 00:08:10.241
Like, I think this woman gave up on life and just decided like,

00:08:10.242 --> 00:08:11.781
well, this is my only chance.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.120
It's a wild, wild story, and I hope.

00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:16.621
And when I look at the story,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.700
my heart is really sad for that woman.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.400
She just became everything she was.

00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:21.221
Against.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.340
And then she died
