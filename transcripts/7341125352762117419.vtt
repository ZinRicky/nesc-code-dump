00:00.080 --> 00:01.320
These are the things I prep

00:01.320 --> 00:03.600
to make my week just a little bit easier.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.280
This week I started off by making some Cheez its.

00:06.280 --> 00:07.880
I combined all of my ingredients

00:07.880 --> 00:10.100
and then let the dough rest in the fridge.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.240
My bananas weren't as ripe as I wanted them,

00:12.240 --> 00:14.840
so I popped them in the oven to ripen

00:14.840 --> 00:17.800
and then got started on making a chocolate banana bread

00:17.800 --> 00:20.200
this week. Usually make a loaf a week

00:20.200 --> 00:22.040
because it's so easy and quick to make

00:22.040 --> 00:23.360
and everyone loves it.

00:23.360 --> 00:24.960
Then I boiled my chickpeas

00:24.960 --> 00:26.640
for the hummus I was gonna make later

00:26.640 --> 00:29.380
while I prepped a cucumber and herb salad.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.440
I chopped all my ingredients really fine,

00:31.440 --> 00:32.360
added some feta,

00:32.360 --> 00:35.320
and did a really classic olive oil lemon vinaigrette.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.500
This goes well on everything.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.520
Then I moved on to making Moroccan meatballs.

00:40.520 --> 00:41.160
For the protein

00:41.160 --> 00:42.400
I used some ground beef.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.440
And do not forget to put cinnamon in your meatballs.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.380
I promise it's so good.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.760
I pulled my cheese a dough out of the fridge

00:49.760 --> 00:52.840
and sliced it into little squares or rectangles.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.520
Then I put holes in them,

00:54.520 --> 00:55.780
pop them in the oven,

00:56.000 --> 00:56.840
and once they were done

00:56.840 --> 00:59.200
I let them cool while I made my hummus.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.240
I went for a cilantro garlic hummus

01:01.240 --> 01:02.320
this time around.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.720
My husband wanted different types of proteins prepped,

01:04.720 --> 01:06.720
so I made a quick teriyaki sauce

01:06.720 --> 01:08.700
to make teriyaki chicken.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.480
I let that thicken up on the stove

01:10.480 --> 01:12.080
while I sliced up some apples.

01:12.080 --> 01:12.840
For my kids,

01:12.840 --> 01:14.280
and also some broccoli

01:14.280 --> 01:15.740
just to have it handy.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.760
And then it was time to put everything away.

01:17.760 --> 01:21.120
I put away my hummus and moved on to my salad.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.600
I like making smaller quantities of things

01:23.600 --> 01:26.840
just because I get over the flavors really quickly.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.240
Put away my Cheez its,

01:28.240 --> 01:31.200
then moved on to my broccoli and apples.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.360
I also put some lemon juice on my apples

01:33.360 --> 01:34.760
to keep them from Browning.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.280
My teriyaki chicken

01:36.280 --> 01:37.520
and that same morning

01:37.520 --> 01:39.920
I started making some Korean shredded beef

01:39.920 --> 01:40.840
in my crock pot,

01:40.840 --> 01:42.240
so I put that away as well.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.500
Since that was done.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.440
Is so versatile.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.600
I put it on sandwiches,

01:45.600 --> 01:46.800
rice, tortillas,

01:46.800 --> 01:49.600
anything. And that wraps up my meal prep for this week.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.880
I don't put my banana bread in a separate container

01:52.880 --> 01:56.020
because it's usually gone in two to three days anyways.
