00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.140
Am I in love with my husband of four years?

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.920
Before my husband and I got engaged,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.320
we had a courtship with very strict physical boundaries

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.360
that we set in the place.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.600
We tried very hard to keep our emotions

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.800
and romance out of it

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.520
so that we can get to know each other

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.880
logically and deeply

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.700
without overlooking anything in infatuation.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.720
Because of this,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.840
y'all are wondering,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.260
did we fall in love?

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.400
Do we have a romantic relationship now?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.200
Is it. Or is it more of a partnership?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.600
Well, it was a good thing we didn't touch

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.560
until we got engaged,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.600
because we found out the physical touch

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.160
is both of our primary love languages.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.080
Couple months before we got engaged,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.500
I knew that I was definitely growing to love Andrew.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.480
Signs of infatuation were cropping up.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.000
He gave me butterflies.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.240
I was nervous around him.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.160
I couldn't hardly spend enough time with him,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.960
which was difficult

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.920
being long distance.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.860
I was hanging on to his every word.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.260
Saying yes to marry him was the easiest

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.380
and the most anticipated question I have ever answered.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.960
We immediately fell into our first tug.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.100
And considering how we're still attached at the hip,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.100
I don't think we ever broke that.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.840
Now, four years later,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.620
we're still called the lovebirds.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.240
We're each other's best friends,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.280
and if we're in the same room,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.940
we're probably touching somehow.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.240
But most importantly,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.700
I believe that we have a love that transcends feelings.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.720
A love that We show every day by actions and words.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.080
Even when it's been a long day

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.800
or were stressed

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.860
or not feeling the butterflies at that moment.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.160
We put each other first

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.960
and we sacrifice for the others well being.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.602
And that, my friends, is love.
