00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
I asked my toddlers what they wanted for lunch today.

00:02.561 --> 00:03.961
They both said pizza,

00:03.962 --> 00:06.921
which took me by surprise since they don't usually like it,

00:06.922 --> 00:09.881
but nevertheless, I got started on making them some.

00:09.882 --> 00:11.841
I combined some flour, water,

00:11.842 --> 00:13.201
yeast, and some salt

00:13.202 --> 00:17.041
before mixing that together and letting that rise for about two hours.

00:17.042 --> 00:21.201
While that was rising, I got started on making some mozzarella cheese.

00:21.202 --> 00:24.601
I warmed up some milk, combined that with citric acid and rennet

00:24.602 --> 00:27.801
before slicing it and returning it back to the stove.

00:27.802 --> 00:30.041
And once it hit the temperature I needed it to,

00:30.042 --> 00:31.841
I strained it, stretched it,

00:31.842 --> 00:34.341
and formed it into my mozzarella balls.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.200
Place those into cold water

00:36.201 --> 00:39.081
while I made the rest of my ingredients for my pizza.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.081
They requested plain cheese pizza,

00:41.082 --> 00:43.761
so I got started on making the tomato sauce.

00:43.762 --> 00:45.681
Kept it really simple with that.

00:45.682 --> 00:47.201
I also made some hot honey,

00:47.202 --> 00:49.481
since they like a drizzle of that on their pizza.

00:49.482 --> 00:51.641
By combining some honey with chili

00:51.642 --> 00:55.521
and letting that simmer on the stove for about 30 to 40 minutes.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.001
And transferred it over to a squeeze bottle.

00:58.002 --> 01:00.441
And at this point my dough had doubled in size,

01:00.442 --> 01:03.601
so I flowered my work surface and transferred it over.

01:03.602 --> 01:06.961
I cut it in four parts and rolled each of them into a little ball

01:06.962 --> 01:09.721
before stretching it out into a pizza shape,

01:09.722 --> 01:13.481
sliced up my mozzarella, and then it was time to top my pizza.

01:13.482 --> 01:17.361
Started with the sauce. And layered my mozzarella cheese on top of that

01:17.362 --> 01:20.921
before popping it in the oven for about six to eight minutes.

01:20.922 --> 01:23.281
Once it was golden brown, I pulled it out

01:23.282 --> 01:26.801
and drizzled it with some of that hot honey before slicing it up.

01:26.802 --> 01:28.284
We were so excited to eat.
