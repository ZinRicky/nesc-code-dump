00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.880
To anyone who loves vintage fashion,

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:03.281
this is your reminder to be so,

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:06.761
so careful where you send things to go get cleaned or taken care of.

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:08.481
I have this beautiful vintage dress.

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:10.421
It's handmade, it's unlined,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.520
and somehow it got in the regular dry cleaning pile,

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:15.101
and my husband took it to dry cleaning,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.240
and now the entire bottom of the dress,

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:17.921
like, the hem,

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:21.841
came apart. You can kind of see where that line used to be.

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:25.241
So thankfully, it's not completely ruined,

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:26.001
but you can see, like,

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.441
look at all this fraying on the end of it.

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:31.121
I'm really hoping I can take it to a seamstress and get it rehemed

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:33.801
and hopefully get that all cleaned up.

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:37.601
But regular dry cleaners. Regular cleaners, like,

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:41.461
don't always really know how to handle things like vintage.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.520
And the stitching is so delicate because it's so old,

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:47.561
that this is a shame on me kind of moment,

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:51.201
but hopefully one that will help you not potentially

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:52.981
ruin your favorite vintage garments.
