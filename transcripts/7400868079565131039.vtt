00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
You know what? Your kids want

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:05.681
so much more than three hours of you standing in the kitchen

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:09.561
making pasta by hand, making meatballs by hand,

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:12.161
and marinara sauce from scratch from tomatoes.

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:14.261
Do you know what they would rather have?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.400
They would rather have played a game with you.

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:20.041
They would have rather played hide and seek.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:23.961
And that's the goal of this tried wife bullshit.

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:27.481
You're gonna have all these kids because I know you want them.

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:29.081
Because that's your little heart's desire.

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:31.201
Cause we as a fucking nation,

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:32.721
as a culture, as a world,

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:36.121
have groomed you as a woman to think your only fucking worth is life

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:37.281
is when you have children.

00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:39.801
So because you have this burning

00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:42.701
fire desire in your heart to be a mother,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.960
I'm gonna give you an insurmountable amount of children.

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:48.601
It's like the parent of the 50s who makes you sit in that.

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:49.601
They catch you smoking cigarettes

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:51.241
and then they make you smoke a whole entire pack.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:51.721
It's like, oh, yeah,

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:53.561
you wanna be a mom? You wanna be a mom?

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:54.841
I'm gonna give you so many kids

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:57.481
that it's hard to be there for everything that they need.

00:00:57.482 --> 00:00:59.361
It's gonna be hard to enjoy their moments

00:00:59.362 --> 00:01:00.681
because you're always riddled with guilt

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:03.181
of what you're not doing for one of the other kids.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.200
And then I'm gonna put this requirement of everything home cooked

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.401
so that you don't even get to mother them the way you want.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.661
You Don't get to spend time with them the way that you want.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.140
And you don't have memories with them like you want.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.340
That the kids are off doing whatever fuck all shit that they're doing

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.360
while you're in the kitchen cooking.

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:25.101
And the kids would much rather have memories of.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.940
Mom pushed me on the swings.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.900
Mom sat down and watched a movie with me.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.320
Mommy, you know,

00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:34.181
snuggled with me, and we had a tea party with my bears.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.120
So you don't have to wonder

00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:40.561
what the fuck happens at the end of Ballerina Farm.

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:41.961
You can see what happens

00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:44.981
from just looking all the fucking way around you.
