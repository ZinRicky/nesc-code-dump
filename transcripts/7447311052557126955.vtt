00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.880
Okay, you know what?

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:05.621
I have to say it. I disagree with this comment.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.760
Hear me out. Even if this is true,

00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:12.921
that implies that 90% of men are inherently terrible at marriage

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:14.561
and only 10% are good.

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:19.161
Because 90% of women are ending marriages with your justification of,

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:22.041
we've told them a million times to change and they haven't,

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:23.001
and we checked out. Now,

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:28.241
this is true. All of my breakups in the past have been me checking out

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:31.081
six months prior to finally breaking out up with them.

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:32.481
I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this,

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:36.821
but here's the thing. Men want a very specific thing,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.860
and it is to be valued and respected and loved,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.620
just like we want to be loved.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.620
I have seen men, including my own,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.240
tell women, I don't want you to work.

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:51.041
I don't care if you make this much money.

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:54.001
I don't care if you think you have to be a boss, babe,

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:57.781
that is not what I want in home or in the bed.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.800
But women will sit there for years and years and years

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:04.681
and try to change a man into being something that he is not,

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:06.841
as most men are not.

00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:09.561
And then she will say that she is unsatisfied in the marriage,

00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:11.201
and she will initiate the divorce.

00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:13.381
I am speaking not only from statistics,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.620
but also from cultural analysis,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.660
all the research I've done and my personal experience.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.280
Most of us want traditional men,

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.081
but We don't wanna be traditional women.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.801
Most of us want high value man,

00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:25.621
but we don't wanna be a high value woman.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.040
Now, the value add is different in our eyes than it is theirs.

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:34.001
We think we're valuable because we make 80,000 a year and we're a boss,

00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:35.241
babe, and we work a corporate ladder

00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:36.241
and we have benefits

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:38.721
and he doesn't have to worry about bills cause I pay for half of them.

00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:41.881
They don't want that. They don't care about that.

00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:45.981
So what we think is valuable on the sex sexual marketplace,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.860
in our eyes, it is not what men value.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.520
And if you're gonna go buy a car,

00:01:51.521 --> 00:01:53.281
you're gonna dictate what the value is.

00:01:53.282 --> 00:01:55.121
The person of the car isn't gonna say what it is,

00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:57.201
it's gonna be the person buying the car.

00:01:57.202 --> 00:01:58.721
So if a man looks at a woman and says,

00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:00.301
I don't really value this,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.400
but they keep saying, no,

00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:02.681
I'm a high valuable person,

00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:04.321
I'm a high valuable wife, a woman,

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:08.321
you should marry me, it doesn't change what they inherently want.

00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:13.941
And we think that this is so machismo or it's so toxic masculinity.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.240
But holy hell,

00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:19.101
how toxic is it to tell men what they think they should want

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.000
and tell them, no,

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.961
you're wrong, I'm valuable because I'm a boss, babe?

00:02:22.962 --> 00:02:23.961
And they're like, hmm,

00:02:23.962 --> 00:02:27.801
I would really be happy if you stayed home with the children and, uh,

00:02:27.802 --> 00:02:30.681
you showed me respect when I came home and We loved each other,

00:02:30.682 --> 00:02:33.301
and it was an equal relationship.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.880
But we have been trained in our culture

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:38.221
that we don't wanna do any of those things,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.760
even though biologically, it fits our gender roles. Right?

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.441
We were the ones who birthed the child,

00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:46.001
were the ones that are meant to take care of them.

00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:49.381
But I know so many women who will drop them off at daycare,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.320
go to work, and the man will still say,

00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:53.481
I would really much rather you be watching my children.

00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:54.121
But they're like, oh,

00:02:54.122 --> 00:02:56.021
my god, you're putting me in a box

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.840
because I wanna work, and I'm a boss, baby.

00:02:57.841 --> 00:02:59.281
And you just don't respect me.

00:02:59.282 --> 00:03:00.641
And your toxic masculinity.

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:01.441
Like,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.860
I understand there are bad marriages,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.060
but one, choose better from the beginning.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.040
Two,

00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:11.901
what we think is valuable is not what most men find valuable in women.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.500
And three, we are constantly wanting them to change,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.520
when in reality, a lot of women are not wanting to change.

00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:21.041
And everything we've done for the last cent,

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:25.401
like, generation has been Guinea pigs in our culture.

00:03:25.402 --> 00:03:28.961
Because I understand that we have equal rights and equal freedom,

00:03:28.962 --> 00:03:30.721
but we've taken it a little too far,

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:32.341
and it is affecting relationships.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.760
The biggest thing here is just listening to your partner.

00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:36.121
We expect men to listen to us,

00:03:36.122 --> 00:03:39.161
but do we listen to them? And I'm speaking from personal experience,

00:03:39.162 --> 00:03:42.321
because there was a time where I insisted on being a boss.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.201
Babe. And my husband told me over and over and over again

00:03:45.202 --> 00:03:47.281
how he just didn't like it.

00:03:47.282 --> 00:03:50.321
And the truth is, it didn't feed my soul as much as being here

00:03:50.322 --> 00:03:52.021
with those two babies right now

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.880
and taking care of my home and him.

00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:54.761
And guess what?

00:03:54.762 --> 00:03:58.921
I have all the time in the world to be something different or bigger.

00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:00.241
That doesn't mean it's just my title.

00:04:00.242 --> 00:04:03.081
That's not my only label is mom and wife.

00:04:03.082 --> 00:04:04.041
There's so much more to me.

00:04:04.042 --> 00:04:06.901
And he sees that. He allows me to do things like this.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.480
But, god,

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.681
we just. We expect so much from men.

00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:11.601
And they were like, well,

00:04:11.602 --> 00:04:14.041
we told him for years, and then we finally left.

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:16.781
And I just. I find it.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.420
Find it unjustifiable to say that that is why 90% of women leave men.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.400
So you're just implying that the entire nation,

00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:27.101
all of our men, suck,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.900
and that is why we do it. And it's okay.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.347
That's my opinion.
