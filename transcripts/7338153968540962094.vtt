00:00.200 --> 00:02.960
Today is my husband and I's fourth wedding anniversary,

00:02.960 --> 00:05.360
so I decided to wake up super early

00:05.360 --> 00:08.060
and make some bagels and cream cheese from scratch.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.920
I started by making my bagel dough

00:09.920 --> 00:12.040
by combining warm water with yeast,

00:12.040 --> 00:13.040
adding some flour,

00:13.040 --> 00:14.520
brown sugar, and salt.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.320
I needed that in my mixer until it came together,

00:17.320 --> 00:18.920
and then I turned it out

00:18.920 --> 00:22.100
and needed it by hand for another six to eight minutes.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.680
Once that was soft to the touch,

00:23.680 --> 00:25.280
I put it in my oil bowl

00:25.280 --> 00:28.480
and covered it with a shower cap and a kitchen towel.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.720
Then I got started on making my cream cheese.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.400
So I added some whole milk to my pot

00:33.400 --> 00:34.600
with some lemon juice

00:34.600 --> 00:36.780
and let that go until it curdled.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.240
Once all the way was separated,

00:38.240 --> 00:39.960
I poured it into my strainer

00:39.960 --> 00:41.320
lined with a cheese cloth

00:41.320 --> 00:42.320
and let that cool

00:42.320 --> 00:44.400
and then pressed out all the liquid,

00:44.400 --> 00:46.040
added that to my food processor,

00:46.040 --> 00:47.800
and let that go until it was smooth.

00:47.800 --> 00:48.640
In the meantime,

00:48.640 --> 00:50.640
I pulled my garlic out of the oven,

00:50.640 --> 00:51.360
let that cool

00:51.360 --> 00:53.120
while I sliced up some chives

00:53.120 --> 00:55.920
and added both of those things to my cream cheese

00:55.920 --> 00:58.680
with a good pinch of salt and some of that olive oil.

00:58.680 --> 00:59.360
By this point,

00:59.360 --> 01:01.160
my dough was almost double in size,

01:01.160 --> 01:04.000
so I cut it into eight pieces

01:04.000 --> 01:06.200
and form those into little balls

01:06.200 --> 01:08.200
before poking a little hole in them

01:08.200 --> 01:10.840
and stretching that out to resemble a bagel.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.720
I Repeated that process with all eight pieces,

01:13.720 --> 01:15.320
and then covered those

01:15.320 --> 01:17.520
while I prep my honey and water,

01:17.520 --> 01:19.120
add all of my toppings laying out.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.800
And then the bagels went in the water

01:20.800 --> 01:22.800
for about a minute on each side

01:22.800 --> 01:25.000
before I put them on my Parchment paper. Paper.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.680
I brushed some egg wash on them

01:26.680 --> 01:28.640
and then layered my toppings on.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.360
So I did a few different ones.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.440
Sesame, smoked

01:31.440 --> 01:32.520
sea salt, cheddar,

01:32.520 --> 01:33.560
and Fresno chili.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.600
I baked those for about 25 minutes,

01:35.600 --> 01:37.880
and they came out looking so perfect.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.440
But he always needs his toasted,

01:39.440 --> 01:40.360
so he did that,

01:40.360 --> 01:41.880
and he gave them a 10 out of 10,

01:41.880 --> 01:43.400
which is very rare.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.120
I was very pleased with that.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.200
And then I made mine with my roasted garlic and chive

01:48.200 --> 01:49.000
cream cheese

01:49.000 --> 01:50.640
and the pickles I made the other day.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.280
At this point, look,

01:51.280 --> 01:52.800
he's already had three bagels,

01:52.800 --> 01:54.860
so I would say he enjoyed it.
