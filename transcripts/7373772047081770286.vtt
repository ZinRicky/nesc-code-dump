00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.680
the thing that y'all are not understanding is that being a fat person

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:05.560
is legitimately traumatizing

00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:06.720
not like internet oh

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:07.820
this is traumatizing

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.980
traumatizing as in I this year was diagnosed with cptsd

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.100
complex Post traumatic stress disorder

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.120
as a result of growing up as a fat person and the trauma that comes with that

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:24.040
there is legitimate trauma that comes with growing up as a child

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:27.760
and believing that your entire value is tied into your body

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:31.760
that no one will love you because you're fat and that you will not have any love

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:33.960
any success any friends because you are fat

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:37.280
society literally treats fat people as if we are worthless

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:37.800
like like

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:41.160
I don't know how y'all think that that shit is not gonna fuck people up

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:42.000
like it just

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.920
it does it messes with your head

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:44.720
like I

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:48.880
it's crazy because the amount of hate that I receive for being a fat person

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.840
like if you guys saw like

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:52.740
the shit people said to me on the internet

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.280
you would be flabbergasted

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:55.800
like this is not just like

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:57.160
a quirky oh

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:57.760
you know like

00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:59.120
it's really hard being fat

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.940
no it's like in your developmental stages

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.920
you are constantly thinking about your body and like

00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:07.360
feeling absolutely worthless to the point where like

00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:08.840
you feel dehumanized

00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:09.560
I don't know that shit

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:10.840
it just it messes you up

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:11.880
you know and like

00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:13.120
I'm dealing with it like it's

00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:14.840
I'm fine it's not like

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.980
you know I think that experience is very different for everybody else

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.760
and I think obviously this like

00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:21.560
this definitely varies person to person

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:24.440
but like I don't think that y'all like

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:28.160
can fully grasp the legitimate like

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.740
trauma that comes with being a fat person

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.920
in the world like

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.120
I just I don't think that y'all fully get it

00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:39.120
nobody is meant to deal with that like

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:41.780
level of consistent criticism and hatred

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.320
it's not like

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:42.800
oh like

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.640
woe is me my life is so hard

00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:45.360
like sob story

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:46.200
it's just like I

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:48.320
I'm not saying this like

00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:50.080
to ask for sympathy by any means

00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:51.880
I'm just saying this because like

00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:57.600
I just genuinely don't think people understand the mental toll that it takes

00:01:57.601 --> 00:01:59.020
and it's really funny because if you're

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.040
you're gonna say

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.840
I care about fat people's health

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:04.160
like the only reason I'm commenting on their body

00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:05.200
is because I care about their health

00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:06.400
like that's not true

00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:08.080
you don't you're a virtue signaling

00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:13.020
and you're using this idea of health to give you a reason to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.400
be cruel to fat people

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:15.240
that's just that's literally what it is

00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:17.400
what if you actually cared about fat people's health

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:21.040
like mental health is also a factor in that

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:22.720
and a lot of time

00:02:22.721 --> 00:02:24.660
let's say a fat person can't take care of themselves

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.400
I promise you

00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:27.940
if their mental health isn't good

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.480
they're not gonna be healthy

00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:31.240
they're not gonna lose weight

00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:33.380
they're not gonna do anything that you want them to do

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.720
so I don't know

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:38.840
probably not the best person to talk about this topic because like

00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:42.220
I'm still figuring out what that means for myself and like

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.880
you know I

00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:46.040
I still don't really fully understand how it impacts my life

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:46.840
but like like

00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:50.520
it's just it's more than hurt feeling the way people are treated matters

00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:51.280
it impacts them

00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:53.360
it impacts the way they live their life

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.380
it impacts our relationship with the world

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.260
a lifetime of persistent and constant cruelty

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.160
is going to have an impact on a person

00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:02.080
and you cannot claim to care about people

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.382
if you are someone that is going to contribute to that
