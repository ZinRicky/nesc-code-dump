00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
We're spending 48 hours in Austria,

00:02.081 --> 00:03.521
then we're back for a day.

00:03.522 --> 00:05.081
Then we're packing up the other kids

00:05.082 --> 00:07.961
and spending September and the beginning of October

00:07.962 --> 00:09.801
all over Europe and New York.

00:09.802 --> 00:13.881
But first things first. We're getting ready to fly to Austria today.

00:13.882 --> 00:15.681
It's a work trip for both lucky and I.

00:15.682 --> 00:19.441
We're taking little whimsy Lou and the other kids are staying at home.

00:19.442 --> 00:21.561
Lately, I've barely been getting any sleep.

00:21.562 --> 00:23.881
I get four hours of sleep on a good night,

00:23.882 --> 00:25.841
and I have the most vivid dreams,

00:25.842 --> 00:27.561
which is absolutely crazy.

00:27.562 --> 00:29.841
So naturally, I'm extra tired.

00:29.842 --> 00:31.881
One of the first things I do is skincare,

00:31.882 --> 00:33.881
and then the kids tend to wake up.

00:33.882 --> 00:36.961
So we all make our way downstairs to start breakfast.

00:36.962 --> 00:39.281
You guys know I need my hot cup of tea.

00:39.282 --> 00:40.441
I've got so much tea

00:40.442 --> 00:43.361
that I think I'll need a second tea drawer at this point.

00:43.362 --> 00:46.281
My sister and my niece are here to watch the kids for us.

00:46.282 --> 00:49.041
So I got started on making the kids some oatmeal.

00:49.042 --> 00:52.081
I let that simmer, and then topped it with some strawberries,

00:52.082 --> 00:54.081
some maple syrup, and some banana.

00:54.082 --> 00:56.361
After that, I rushed upstairs and got myself ready,

00:56.362 --> 00:58.401
cause I realized I barely had an hour

00:58.402 --> 01:00.601
until our driver was here to pick us up.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.321
So I put on some light makeup,

01:02.322 --> 01:05.821
got dressed, and then got little whimsy Lou dressed as well.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.880
Thirty minutes before our driver pulled up,

01:07.881 --> 01:10.281
lucky realized that he was all Out of moisturizers.

01:10.282 --> 01:12.201
So he made some really quick,

01:12.202 --> 01:13.801
which took him about fifteen minutes

01:13.802 --> 01:16.721
before we rushed down the stairs and got into the car

01:16.722 --> 01:18.821
since we didn't wanna be late to the airport.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.840
We made it there right on time.

01:20.841 --> 01:22.961
I haven't been back to Europe in a while,

01:22.962 --> 01:24.321
so I was very excited

01:24.322 --> 01:27.001
going to a country that speaks the German language.

01:27.002 --> 01:28.521
I realized we didn't have breakfast,

01:28.522 --> 01:31.281
so we headed over to the lounge to grab some really quick

01:31.282 --> 01:33.021
before boarding our flight.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.440
This wasn't too long of a flight.

01:34.441 --> 01:36.441
I think it was a nine hour flight to Paris

01:36.442 --> 01:38.681
and then another few hours to Munich.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.121
I always have to take my shoes off first thing,

01:41.122 --> 01:44.049
scan the menu. But once we arrived, it was stunning.
