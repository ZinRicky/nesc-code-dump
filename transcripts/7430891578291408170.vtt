00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
Why? You should never, ever,

00:01.921 --> 00:05.201
ever beg someone to stay. Because with the right person,

00:05.202 --> 00:07.401
your existence will be enough.

00:07.402 --> 00:09.501
You don't have to beg for affection,

00:09.680 --> 00:12.840
respect and validation. If you find the right person,

00:12.841 --> 00:14.241
they will give that to you freely.

00:14.242 --> 00:15.321
I guarantee you.

00:15.322 --> 00:18.961
If you let go of the person who does not serve you and your life,

00:18.962 --> 00:21.281
you're opening up space for the person who will.

00:21.282 --> 00:24.401
So stop. Stop begging for someone to stay in your life. Dad.

00:24.402 --> 00:26.987
Kick the door wide open for them. Let them leave.
