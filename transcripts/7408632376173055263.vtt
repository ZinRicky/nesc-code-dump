00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.040
Here's the thing, I.

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:03.881
I wanna make it known before I start,

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:04.721
like, defending Kim.

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:07.221
I don't like her. I think she's a shitty mom.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.080
I think she did so many things wrong.

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:13.121
I don't think she had her kids best interest at heart almost ever.

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:15.241
Like, just disclaimer,

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:18.761
I'm not a fan of Kim or her style of mothering or parenting.

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:23.681
But we're talking about the trad wife life and where it leads you,

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:25.561
what path it will take you in life.

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:27.761
This woman, regardless of if you agree with her shit,

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:30.921
the agreement was, I'm gonna stay home and take care of the kids,

00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:32.601
the farm, do the homeschooling, everything.

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:33.161
You, Barry,

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:35.241
are gonna work and financially support the family.

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:37.041
And that is how we are all gonna share it.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:39.161
And in the end. Exactly.

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.181
She's living on a fucking boat,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.960
taking showers in a public fucking bathroom.

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.981
If it weren't for her fucking boyfriend,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.420
where the fuck would this bitch be?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.280
That's my point exactly. When you get set up,

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:55.641
when you set yourself up to be in the tried wife life,

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:59.721
when it ends, you're gonna end up homeless with nothing,

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:01.001
dependent on other people still,

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:01.921
and they're not your husband.

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:03.081
So, you know,

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:05.981
good luck finding somebody to really fully support you.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.120
And then they're gonna hold your kids captive and they're gonna say,

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:11.361
well, what kind of mother could you be?

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:12.721
How are you gonna be able to support your kids?

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:13.921
Look at you. You're living on a boat.

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:15.841
You're living here. You're living on someone's couch.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.521
How can you take care of your kids?

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:20.461
And it's gonna backfire in your face.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.660
You know, I just think that's such a shitty position to take

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.320
and not look at it and say, wow,

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:28.641
why is she on a boat?

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:33.401
What did she have in her own name that she could put down for a house

00:01:33.402 --> 00:01:35.801
or put down to have her own place to live?

00:01:35.802 --> 00:01:38.481
Everything is tied up because everything was marital property.

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:40.961
Everything were marital assets and marital debt.

00:01:40.962 --> 00:01:44.741
And now what's happening? Barry's trying to take her for everything,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.160
as if she didn't give all that she had for those 24 years.

00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:50.081
Again, I'm not defending her.

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:51.001
I don't think she's a good mom.

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:52.681
I think she was giving what she had to give.

00:01:52.682 --> 00:01:54.721
I don't think she's well in the head.

00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:56.701
I think she's got a lot of fucking issues,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.420
but. Exactly.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.840
You're gonna spend your whole life

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:04.041
giving everything you have to these people, saying,

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:06.241
it's okay, I know they're gonna take care of me,

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:09.201
I know I'm gonna be okay. I have all my faith and trust in these people.

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:12.801
And in the end, you're the one left having to fend for yourself,

00:02:12.802 --> 00:02:14.961
whatever that means. In her situation,

00:02:14.962 --> 00:02:17.621
it's living on a fucking broken boat,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.540
using public bathrooms and charcoal grills.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.200
And hopefully her boyfriend can help her out sometime.

00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:26.081
So she's still stuck, you know,

00:02:26.082 --> 00:02:28.401
it's the Chad, Wife,

00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:31.201
life is really only benefits the man.

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:33.221
And if you're the woman in the situation,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.340
you are setting yourself up for potentially a really fucking shitty,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.200
you know, elder years,

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:41.901
older years, whatever.
