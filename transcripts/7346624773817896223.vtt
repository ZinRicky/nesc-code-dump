00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.840
I have worked outside of the home

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.400
and I have come home at the end of the day not wanting to cook.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.920
So just because I'm a stay at home wife and mom now

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.640
doesn't mean I've never had a job or I've never had that experience.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.000
Not saying cooking from scratch is easy to do,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.220
but I am saying it is doable to do

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.400
because people do have the time to do these things if they want to.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.520
It's just the matter that it's easier to get take out and I.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.520
It's fine if you do that.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.420
I'm not saying you're a bad person if you get take out.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.080
But the people who say that oh, you have money or you have time,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.400
so therefore your privilege,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.320
people don't have that privilege.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.480
We live in a day and age where you have bread machines.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.200
We live in a day and age where you have instant pots and Crock Pots

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.880
and an instant pot can make meat tender within like 45 minutes.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.840
We're not rich,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.520
we're lower income, like lower middle class,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.280
lower come side of things.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.260
Like I understand how expensive things can be.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.620
About willpower and doing the things you don't wanna do

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.240
and not doing the easy thing that is to do.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.840
And again, I don't care if you could take out,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.440
we could take out sometimes because guess what?

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.400
I'm exhausted at the end of the day and I don't wanna cook.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.731
So I fully sympathize. With it
