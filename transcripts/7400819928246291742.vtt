00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.920
My dad asked for muffins last night

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:04.221
as we were closing up the kitchen after dinner,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.480
so I prepared a batter of primitive wheat flour

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.361
and allowed it to ferment while we slept.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.121
In the morning, while brewing my coffee,

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:12.401
I threw together the batter in one big bowl.

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:15.481
I sweetened them with just two tablespoons of coconut sugar.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.561
My mom had brought some oversized zucchinis

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:19.301
that I last picked from the farm,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.720
so I figured this would be a great way to use them.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.321
The batter is stiff, which I want,

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:26.621
and a wooden spoon does the job to mix everything together nicely.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.400
We had some wild blueberries in the freezer,

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:29.721
so I folded these in last

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:31.761
and then greased the muffin pan with coconut oil.

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:33.641
Using 1/4 cup measuring utensil,

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:36.361
I carefully distributed the muffin batter into 12 cups

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:40.081
and then placed in a preheated 425 degree Fahrenheit oven.

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:43.521
The temperature is reduced to 375 after 7 minutes.

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:45.721
The final result, after another 18 minutes,

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:47.481
is decadent muffins with crispy,

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:49.601
slightly brown tops and moist centers.

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:52.761
Breakfast was served with cast iron fried eggs and warm muffins

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:54.521
fresh out of the oven. My parents,

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:58.021
the kids, Eric, and I all sat around the table to enjoy what we had.
