00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
I am a very traditionally seen as a very small woman.

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:05.521
Like, even when I go to get, like,

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:06.761
merch at a concert and I'm like, oh,

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:07.321
can I get a T-shirt?

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:08.721
They immediately assume small, and I'm like,

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:10.261
I'm literally a large.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.080
But here's the thing.

00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:11.881
People see me as skinny.

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:16.061
I. This is like, I'm a skinny girl.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.860
We get the. We get the bloat.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.460
The skinny girl bloat is real.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.280
It's not. It's.

00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:25.721
There's a lot of smoking

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:30.221
mirrors and good posture to the skinny girl thing, okay?

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.480
There's lots of chubby skinny girls.

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.121
So please, please,

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:34.601
please, please.

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:36.841
I love, I love when my,

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:39.441
my curvier friends do their thing,

00:00:39.442 --> 00:00:41.681
because it really does give me confidence, because I'm like,

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:42.921
oh, god, people think I'm skinny,

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:45.021
but if they only knew I'm not really skinny.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.060
And because skinny doesn't mean beautiful, and fat doesn't mean ugly,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.200
you know what I mean?

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:52.121
So I love when we just, like,

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:53.421
show our natural bodies,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.500
cause, like,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.280
the girls be natural in.

00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:59.901
And I mean, natural girls be natural.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.700
I love you.
