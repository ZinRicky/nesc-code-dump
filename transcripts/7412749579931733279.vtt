00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
This is the biggest question that most women ask.

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:03.161
How do I transition financially?

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:05.201
How do I get out from underneath my husband

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:07.081
if he's been a sole provider for all these years?

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:08.921
You're gonna have to play his ass.

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:11.081
There's no cute way to put it.

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:12.161
You're gonna have to pretend.

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:15.461
And when you're like, I cannot do this any longer,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.400
you kind of switch into, like,

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:21.381
I feel like it's your last reserves of energy.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.980
And that's what you're gonna finally,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.820
finally fucking take from.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.200
You're gonna click into, like,

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:28.401
Ultra fucking good girl mode.

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.681
You're gonna be the little fucking princess, like.

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:34.081
Like if you guys just got married yesterday,

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:37.801
he's gonna be shocked at how you have transformed

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:39.441
into the perfect fucking wife.

00:00:39.442 --> 00:00:40.401
Everything is. Oh,

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:40.881
my god, you're right.

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:43.481
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, honey.

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:45.541
You know, we're gonna fix everything.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.720
That's it. He's right about everything.

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.781
I'm sorry is the answer to every fucking thing.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.280
Because you're gonna be asking more of him than you normally do.

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:58.641
Because you're gonna ask him to be paying for a course,

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:01.601
a class A, whatever the fuck you need to do,

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:05.961
because it does take some initiative on your part.

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:07.561
You're gonna have to look at your life

00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:09.361
and what you could fucking piece together.

00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:10.881
How could you live? Where could you?

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:13.501
You're gonna have to imagine he's dead.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.360
Imagine what your life is gonna look like.

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:16.561
Budget that shit out, okay?

00:01:16.562 --> 00:01:17.641
Rent is probably gonna Be about.

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:19.721
I could probably live in that apartment complex over there,

00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:21.601
or I could live with my sister over here.

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:23.081
Whatever the fuck. It's your life.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.901
You're gonna have to put those pieces together,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.600
and then you're gonna know how much money you need.

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.241
Now, you're gonna know what kind of job you need.

00:01:29.242 --> 00:01:30.081
You can either get a.

00:01:30.082 --> 00:01:32.321
If your kids are old enough and you can work while they're in school,

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:33.361
boom, right there.

00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:35.381
Just get a job if they're not.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.280
You gotta get creative. You could either start your own business,

00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.081
take a couple. Because anything you do,

00:01:40.082 --> 00:01:42.001
you're gonna have to take a little bit of time to work up.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:42.921
You can start a business

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:46.561
like a cleaning business or a cooking business or anything where you.

00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:48.321
You get to set the price for.

00:01:48.322 --> 00:01:49.841
I need to work this many hours.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.101
This is how much money I need to make per hour,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.840
and this is when I can do it.

00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:56.101
Do you know what I mean? Like,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.680
it's basically time that you take off the stay at home mom hat

00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:01.081
and put on the, like,

00:02:01.082 --> 00:02:02.881
I'm the leader of my family now,

00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:04.601
because that's what you're gonna be.

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:08.861
So you take complete fucking control of your life.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.280
And the only way to do that is to really play the little good girl.

00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:14.281
Play his ass. Let him think you're playing along.

00:02:14.282 --> 00:02:15.761
You're doing all the things he wants you to do,

00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:18.761
but in reality, you're Just getting him to support what you need to do

00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:19.841
so you could get on your feet.

00:02:19.842 --> 00:02:20.921
Cause he's gonna be suspicious.

00:02:20.922 --> 00:02:22.161
He's gonna be like, why the fuck?

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:23.201
All of a sudden she wants school?

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:24.601
Or all of a sudden she wants this?

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:29.041
You just keep sucking his dick to silence so that he shuts the fuck up.

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:31.401
You could get your shit shit straight

00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:33.721
and then leave him when it's time to leave him,

00:02:33.722 --> 00:02:35.201
you know what I mean? In that time,

00:02:35.202 --> 00:02:36.541
you're gonna. You just.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.520
You tune him out. Do you know what I mean?

00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:39.721
Just so that you, you know,

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:41.821
you have the. The end is in sight.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.880
So it's much easier to play good girl now.

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:46.261
Do you know what I mean? So

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.320
that is my deepest advice to you

00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:50.281
when you're trying to transition financially

00:02:50.282 --> 00:02:52.321
and get out and get on your own feet.

00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:55.381
And I am sending you all the love and,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.195
oof, like so much love and encouragement that you make it out.
