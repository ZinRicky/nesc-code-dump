00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
I'm waking up in a hotel room with my husband.

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:08.481
We just had room service. My hair looks like this for a reason.

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:10.981
And this is our Christmas gift to each other.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.120
Usually every year we. We don't really do like physical gifts.

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:17.761
We do a staycation and we'll go shopping

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:18.561
or we'll have lunch

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:23.101
and we'll just have a nice relaxed pace kind of time.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.080
Um, my husband and I have been absolutely drowning recently.

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:30.101
Um, to the point where we're just.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.560
We're both just completely tapped out, right?

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:35.361
And we need to recharge our batteries.

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:38.341
So we are gonna go recharge our batteries today.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.580
I'm gonna go get this under control

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.680
and we're gonna have a lovely day.

00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:45.721
And I love doing things with him.

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:48.781
We giggle so much. We have the best fucking time.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.160
Um, so we're gonna go have a really fun,

00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:54.461
wonderful day here in the great city of Charleston.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.220
Um, it is, however,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.200
packed here,

00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:03.141
so we also might just hide in our hotel room and make the best of it.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.840
Um, alright,

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:06.067
love you. Bye.
