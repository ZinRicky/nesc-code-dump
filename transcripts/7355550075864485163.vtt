00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.600
The solar eclipse is happening today

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.480
there's a lot of ways that the solar eclipse might affect you

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:13.701
as it represents new beginnings

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.960
different star signs and birthdays are supposed to have different reactions

00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.741
So of course if you're single or in a relationship

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.080
changes in your love life can mean very different things

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.921
If there's anything that has the potential to mix things up

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:29.521
I'd say it's an eclipse

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:31.921
whether you're single or in a relationship

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:35.041
expect positive changes in your love life

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:35.961
if you're single

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:39.581
this could mean meeting someone new when you least expect it

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.440
or have better conversations with a romantic partner

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:46.041
and or experience closer connections

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:46.755
in general 

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:50.001
moving over to if you're already in a relationship

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:53.701
you should expect less friction in the relationship

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.560
a more romantic connection with your partner or simply having more engaged

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:00.401
meaningful conversations

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:03.081
I hope you enjoy watching the solar eclipse today

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:05.661
and don't forget to wear productive glasses

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.600
you don't wanna hurt your retinas

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.561
since the solar eclipse is all about new beginnings

00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:14.003
be on the lookout for all these positive changes in your life.
