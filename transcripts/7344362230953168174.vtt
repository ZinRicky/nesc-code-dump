00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
I’m constantly amazed when other men have the audacity to call a woman names

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:10.781
like the B word or even other vulgar language

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.720
even if it's in a joking way,

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:13.761
if you as a man

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:17.215
have the audacity to call me a B word 

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:17.761
ADIÓS 

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:19.701
you're out of my life, like my dad

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.120
I don't care if it's a joke,

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.381
it's not funny,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.440
if you're my man

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:27.961
then you should honor me and respect me and never call me out of my name

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:29.601
your role is to protect me,

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:30.441
not only that,

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:35.621
the idea of someone else calling me the B word should trigger you as a man

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.280
why are people thinking it's a joke or laughing at it?

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.581
it's not a joke and it's not funny

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.000
If you think we're too sensitive for feeling like this

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.381
then news flash

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.260
good men do not call women B words

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.960
Good men know right from wrong

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:53.081
we as women shouldn't apologize or make ourselves seem small

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:58.461
for wanting the basic respect and decency to not call us vulgar names

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.960
If you’re a respectful good man,

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:03.781
you wouldn't call us any names that are not our own.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.660
It’s not cute, it's not funny

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.646
do not call us the B words.
