WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
Wanted to introduce you to some very special.

00:02.321 --> 00:08.321
This is Tana. And Tana is amazing nutritionist and dear friend

00:08.322 --> 00:12.041
who helped us get no in your hands.

00:12.042 --> 00:15.361
So I wanted her to come to the farm and just chat.

00:15.362 --> 00:17.481
Charlie taste so good, don't you think?

00:17.482 --> 00:18.961
Taste so good. It is really good.

00:18.962 --> 00:20.481
And we are both chocolate people,

00:20.482 --> 00:23.741
but there is something about the vanilla that if you haven't tried it,

00:23.800 --> 00:25.480
it's rich and it's got like,

00:25.481 --> 00:28.481
a depth to it. Protein has hemp in it.

00:28.482 --> 00:32.401
Hemp protein. And at one of the tastings,

00:32.402 --> 00:34.401
Tanner was like, it feels like the.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.001
The flavor is off. You know,

00:36.002 --> 00:37.881
hemp is one of a superior plant protein.

00:37.882 --> 00:39.521
There's so many benefits for it,

00:39.522 --> 00:41.861
but it also can kind of taste earthy.

00:41.960 --> 00:44.800
So in the taste testing, they put the hemp hole,

00:44.801 --> 00:46.981
which is kind of the outside of the hemp seed,

00:47.040 --> 00:50.340
and it didn't quite taste as rich as we wanted it to.

00:50.760 --> 00:55.200
The. The idea was to quickly run and go grab some hemp heart,

00:55.201 --> 00:56.881
which is the white internal part,

00:56.882 --> 00:58.301
the richer part of the hemp.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.280
We swapped out the hemp whole powder and put in the hemp heart powder,

01:01.281 --> 01:04.981
and then all of a sudden, it got this yummy, rich,

01:05.040 --> 01:06.680
really good creamy flavor.

01:06.681 --> 01:09.181
So that's why we love it, because there's no emulsifiers,

01:09.400 --> 01:12.600
and emulsifiers are put into makeup.

01:12.601 --> 01:14.041
Protein powder, creamy,

01:14.042 --> 01:18.201
but it's a inferior way that actually can kind of ruin your gut health.

01:18.202 --> 01:22.241
So The fact that we were able to do it with hemp is so awesome

01:22.242 --> 01:24.321
because there's no emulsifiers,

01:24.322 --> 01:25.721
and you still get this yummy,

01:25.722 --> 01:27.761
creamy protein powder. Blossom is awesome

01:27.762 --> 01:33.981
because it actually is a massive quantity of peptides and nutrients,

01:34.040 --> 01:36.440
and those are the things that are missing from our diet

01:36.441 --> 01:38.481
that make your gut really, really,

01:38.482 --> 01:40.461
really fortified. Um,

01:40.760 --> 01:41.360
colostrums

01:41.361 --> 01:46.181
lately to also been shown to help with so many health concerns like,

01:46.800 --> 01:50.820
um, allergies and gut health and mental clarity.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.280
The main purpose of colostrum

01:52.281 --> 01:55.241
is to really fortify your internal gut microbiome.

01:55.242 --> 01:56.961
It's not a probiotic, so I don't

01:56.962 --> 01:59.461
people that get confused that it's got a probiotic

01:59.640 --> 02:04.760
actually living in it, but it is a form of a gut fortifier,

02:04.761 --> 02:06.321
so colostrum is so awesome.

02:06.322 --> 02:07.921
Collagen peptides, which are so good.

02:07.922 --> 02:09.261
Collagen is, like,

02:09.880 --> 02:12.920
also an incredible form of a protein

02:12.921 --> 02:15.121
because it has the amino acids

02:15.122 --> 02:17.441
that help strengthen bones and ligaments.

02:17.442 --> 02:19.901
Are really good for your skin and for your hair.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.240
Collagen is. Yeah,

02:21.241 --> 02:22.541
look at your hair. Well,

02:22.800 --> 02:23.720
and yours is, too.

02:23.721 --> 02:26.441
I mean, it's so great because it kind of is sneaky.

02:26.442 --> 02:29.621
It's hard to find you. It's the best to get it from a bovine source.

02:29.680 --> 02:30.960
So collagen.

02:30.961 --> 02:33.841
I feel like I take collagen every single day without fail,

02:33.842 --> 02:36.481
because sure enough, there's some kind of fortification.

02:36.482 --> 02:37.581
As we get old,

02:37.680 --> 02:40.600
our bones and our ligaments and all those things kinda start to decay.

02:40.601 --> 02:42.081
So this is such a great Way to fortify em

02:42.082 --> 02:44.761
100% grass fed way too. And I love it

02:44.762 --> 02:46.941
because in the grass fed way,

02:47.400 --> 02:49.840
there is a component called CLA,

02:49.841 --> 02:51.801
which again, probably too nerdy,

02:51.802 --> 02:52.981
we don't need to go in there.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.360
But why we love that is because when they're grass fed,

02:56.361 --> 02:59.041
they're getting all of the rich nutrients that are in the grass.

02:59.042 --> 03:00.921
Like think of a green blade of grass,

03:00.922 --> 03:02.881
it's got polyphenols, it's got the color,

03:02.882 --> 03:04.381
it's grown by the light,

03:04.440 --> 03:06.800
has all the rich sources of vitamins and minerals.

03:06.801 --> 03:08.641
So when the cows eat that,

03:08.642 --> 03:11.001
then you know that the way the cow is producing

03:11.002 --> 03:12.961
also has all of those properties in it.

03:12.962 --> 03:15.441
Simplest way to put it. Next up is the hemp protein,

03:15.442 --> 03:18.081
which we already talked about in your inulin fiber.

03:18.082 --> 03:18.961
Fiber. You guys,

03:18.962 --> 03:21.201
this is like one of the coolest things about this protein

03:21.202 --> 03:24.941
is a lot of protein powders don't have fiber in it.

03:25.040 --> 03:29.320
We need about 30 to 35 grams of fiber every single day

03:29.321 --> 03:32.881
just to really help our our bodies function.

03:32.882 --> 03:33.321
Well, like,

03:33.322 --> 03:36.261
fiber is the missing ingredient in most people's diet.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.120
And so in order to be able to get it,

03:38.121 --> 03:39.401
it comes in little quantities,

03:39.402 --> 03:41.761
like twos and three. So it can be tricky,

03:41.762 --> 03:43.601
but it does add up. And so it was so awesome.

03:43.602 --> 03:46.781
We put in an inulin fiber in the protein powder,

03:46.840 --> 03:50.180
and the inulin fiber acts as a prebiotic,

03:50.360 --> 03:52.560
so it actually feeds the good bacteria.

03:52.561 --> 03:53.841
That's In your gut already.

03:53.842 --> 03:57.161
So there's a bonus. You get the three grams of fiber and the gut boost.

03:57.162 --> 03:59.001
Sometimes people get really bloated

03:59.002 --> 04:00.901
when they use a lot of whey protein.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.760
Is because it has all these other additives

04:04.761 --> 04:06.321
and fillers and natural flavors,

04:06.322 --> 04:08.881
and sometimes the ways also inferior.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.841
So this was really fun to put together,

04:10.842 --> 04:13.081
because you gotta use the best of the best.

04:13.082 --> 04:14.601
And so you don't feel bloated,

04:14.602 --> 04:17.841
you don't feel that kinda like achy gut feeling.

04:17.842 --> 04:20.001
Cause it's just so rich with nutrients in it.

04:20.002 --> 04:22.921
And it really did will boost your

04:22.922 --> 04:26.001
your gut microbiome. It will help your muscle mass increase.

04:26.002 --> 04:28.321
It just helps fortify your whole body.

04:28.322 --> 04:30.081
Of the cute kids laughing in the background.

04:30.082 --> 04:31.241
They're so cute over there.

04:31.242 --> 04:32.521
Okay, so monk fruit,

04:32.522 --> 04:37.081
I think its real ancient name is like Louhan or something like that.

04:37.082 --> 04:39.901
But it's actually been around for thousands of years.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.360
It's a leaf you take and you condense it down

04:42.361 --> 04:43.561
and it naturally sweet. In fact,

04:43.562 --> 04:45.521
that's how they've been sweetening tea in Asia

04:45.522 --> 04:47.461
for thousands and thousands of years.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.920
And there's no high carb load,

04:49.921 --> 04:52.881
there's no artificial flavors of any kind.

04:52.882 --> 04:55.721
It actually is just a leaf that they've taken down and condensed.

04:55.722 --> 04:57.601
That has a natural sweetness to it.

04:57.602 --> 04:58.921
So it's the best way to sweeten your food.

04:58.922 --> 05:00.561
I actually sometimes even will bake with it.

05:00.562 --> 05:03.461
But I love monk fruit. Devia is also a leaf.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.080
In fact, I actually reduced my Own stevia this summer.

05:06.081 --> 05:08.621
I picked the leaves. You know who I got it from was Cynthia.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.960
Cynthia gave me her stevia leaves,

05:10.961 --> 05:14.521
so I boiled them down and then reduced them over the pot,

05:14.522 --> 05:15.961
and it literally is so good.

05:15.962 --> 05:17.981
So there are clean sources of stevia

05:18.200 --> 05:21.120
that you can get and put in protein powder.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.201
So that's why we're not afraid of steam.

05:23.202 --> 05:24.281
Put over pot and reduced it.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.381
And I have a little dropper of my own homemade stevia.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.600
So anyways,

05:27.601 --> 05:28.881
it really. There are clean ways?

05:28.882 --> 05:31.681
Yes. Most often you buy it package,

05:31.682 --> 05:33.121
and it's got some other additives in it.

05:33.122 --> 05:35.401
And some of those additives have been known to cause cancer

05:35.402 --> 05:36.561
and all sorts of things, which. Yes,

05:36.562 --> 05:38.321
we do not wanna go anywhere near that.

05:38.322 --> 05:42.161
No. But there are clean forms of Stevie that you can find and use

05:42.162 --> 05:44.641
that are so great. So we have creamy chocolate.

05:44.642 --> 05:46.201
Hmm. Vanilla bean,

05:46.202 --> 05:48.141
which has the real vanilla.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.920
Oh, that's what makes it so good.

05:49.921 --> 05:51.621
And we have maple cinnamon,

05:51.880 --> 05:54.960
your signature flavor. Signature flavor is so good.

05:54.961 --> 05:58.241
It is so good. I think it's a farm signature flavor. Yeah.

05:58.242 --> 06:00.041
Drinking it for five years,

06:00.042 --> 06:00.401
so. Oh,

06:00.402 --> 06:02.161
my gosh, it's so yummy.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.921
And someone made pancakes out of it.

06:03.922 --> 06:05.961
I tried that. It is so good.

06:05.962 --> 06:07.961
It was delicious. I've mixed it with the pancakes,

06:07.962 --> 06:10.321
and it's good by itself. This protein powder,

06:10.322 --> 06:12.281
it's so yummy when you mix it with the milk.

06:12.282 --> 06:14.321
And I've even Done. Almond milk. Yeah.

06:14.322 --> 06:15.601
And there is something to it

06:15.602 --> 06:17.981
that doesn't feel like it's your typical protein.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.480
Yeah, so true.

06:19.481 --> 06:20.161
Yeah. Yeah,

06:20.162 --> 06:21.481
that was the test for me. I was like,

06:21.482 --> 06:22.481
okay, it's good in milk.

06:22.482 --> 06:23.901
Let's just try with water.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.800
It was good with water. So good.

06:25.801 --> 06:27.841
I warmed up my chocolate one.

06:27.842 --> 06:30.461
I actually had hot water and a little splash of almond milk.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.840
It's even better, actually warm the chocolate one.

06:33.841 --> 06:34.921
So, yeah,

06:34.922 --> 06:35.841
they're all yummy. Okay,

06:35.842 --> 06:39.161
so talk a tiny bit about maple cinnamon and.

06:39.162 --> 06:39.881
Oh, yeah,

06:39.882 --> 06:41.321
the late harvest maple sugar.

06:41.322 --> 06:42.601
Yes, the.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.081
The. You'll notice on the package,

06:44.082 --> 06:46.321
the late harvest maple syrup.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.961
Maple sugar. Sugar, um,

06:48.962 --> 06:52.941
is kept later on in the season because it retains a lot more nutrients.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.680
So when you pull it a little bit too soon,

06:54.681 --> 06:56.121
it's still yummy and has that great flavor.

06:56.122 --> 06:59.141
But when you keep it and don't harvest it until later,

06:59.200 --> 07:02.720
there's a lot more benefits that come with a little bit less carb,

07:02.721 --> 07:05.081
reduced reduction, and it's a little bit sweeter.

07:05.082 --> 07:06.701
It's the flavor that changes,

07:06.720 --> 07:08.160
so you get more bang for your buck.

07:08.161 --> 07:11.901
So the extra. The extra sugar grams that you see on the maple cinnamon

07:12.040 --> 07:14.240
come from the actual maple sweetener.

07:14.241 --> 07:15.601
It's not. Are from the flavor.

07:15.602 --> 07:19.521
It's not like we've added extra sugar to make the flavor more sugary.

07:19.522 --> 07:20.501
Yeah. Sweeter.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.720
But because this protein has that 3 grams of fiber in it,

07:24.721 --> 07:27.461
you can subtract some of the Carb load.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.800
And the fiber will actually kind of act as,

07:29.801 --> 07:30.401
like, a net,

07:30.402 --> 07:34.361
and it will catch and reduce your blood sugar levels or your carb load.

07:34.362 --> 07:36.121
So you don't even actually spike your insulin

07:36.122 --> 07:37.281
because of the fiber that's in there.

07:37.282 --> 07:40.001
Which is another reason why I love that we got to put the fiber in,

07:40.002 --> 07:42.921
so you don't have to stress about that extra added sugar

07:42.922 --> 07:44.821
because it mostly just comes from the maple.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.640
Cinnamon is so great. Cinnamon is actually a metabolism booster.

07:47.641 --> 07:48.901
It's kind of a fat burner.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.880
So you have the cinnamon with the maple and then the fiber.

07:51.881 --> 07:54.041
You've got a perfect combination with lots of flavor,

07:54.042 --> 07:55.841
so it's really good. Mmm.

07:55.842 --> 07:56.681
Yeah, I know.

07:56.682 --> 07:57.481
I love. So fun.

07:57.482 --> 07:59.441
Gorgeous view over here. Oh, yeah,

07:59.442 --> 08:00.721
this is our. This is our view.

08:00.722 --> 08:01.921
I know. And the kids.

08:01.922 --> 08:03.561
It's like the perfect day today.

08:03.562 --> 08:06.261
We got kids jumping on the tramp.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.080
I know. So, anyways,

08:08.081 --> 08:08.721
Hope. Hannah,

08:08.722 --> 08:11.001
thanks for coming. Hopefully we covered all. Yeah.

08:11.002 --> 08:13.341
More things to come. This is so fun.
