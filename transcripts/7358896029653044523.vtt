00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
one thing I've Learned about being in a relationship

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:06.281
is that you should never talk about your partner behind their back

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:09.081
or complain about them to other people

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:10.675
family members, co workers

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:11.841
 whatever it may be

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:14.581
because A, that's none of their business

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.680
And B, it'll make your friends

00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:19.881
family and co workers start to not like your partner

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:20.961
that's just how it is

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.001
theyâ€™re bias because they're your friend

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:24.321
they're your coworker

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:27.361
so they start looking at him as the evil person

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:28.841
or her, whoever it may be

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:30.261
if you have problems

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.320
save that for therapy

00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:34.441
because complaining about your partner is never

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:35.721
ever going to help

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:37.361
I've been guilty of this okay

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:38.401
I was young once

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:39.241
I still am young

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:42.001
But sometimes it feels nice to get things off your chest

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:44.201
The best route is always going to therapy

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:45.881
getting things off your chest that way

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:46.641
not to your friends

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:48.241
family or co workers

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:49.681
Also nobody likes a complainer

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:53.441
so if you're always complaining about things and you're not changing them

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:55.681
or you're still staying in that relationship

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:57.961
then people are gonna start not liking you

00:00:57.962 --> 00:00:58.761
that's just how it is

00:00:58.762 --> 00:01:00.041
because it does affect them

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:01.441
even if you're complaining

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:02.601
seems innocent

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:03.016
it's not

00:01:03.017 --> 00:01:05.041
So try not to complain about your partner

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:06.281
it's not helping anyone

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:08.118
and it's really not fair to your partner
