00:00.080 --> 00:01.480
These birria tacos

00:01.480 --> 00:03.940
are the best thing I've put in my mouth in a while

00:03.960 --> 00:06.620
and better than any takeout taco I've gotten.

00:06.760 --> 00:08.280
So let's make them together.

00:08.280 --> 00:11.080
I started off by cutting up my chuck roast into four

00:11.080 --> 00:12.120
equal pieces,

00:12.120 --> 00:13.320
seasoning them with salt,

00:13.320 --> 00:15.700
and then searing them off in my Dutch oven.

00:15.840 --> 00:16.680
Once they were done,

00:16.680 --> 00:17.560
I pulled them out

00:17.560 --> 00:19.900
and then chopped up some tomato, onion,

00:20.200 --> 00:22.600
put that in my pot alongside some garlic,

00:22.600 --> 00:23.900
tomato paste,

00:23.960 --> 00:26.760
and my three types of chillies that I deseeded

00:26.760 --> 00:28.400
before putting in the pot.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.120
Put those in,

00:29.120 --> 00:30.400
cover that with some water,

00:30.400 --> 00:33.420
and let it simmer until the chillies were soft.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.960
Then I transferred that over to a blender,

00:35.960 --> 00:38.080
blended it all up until it was smooth,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.400
and added that back to the pot with the meat,

00:40.400 --> 00:41.160
some stocks,

00:41.160 --> 00:42.340
some spices.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.200
I made sure to not forget the cinnamon,

00:45.200 --> 00:46.600
and then I put a lid on that

00:46.600 --> 00:49.000
and let it go for three to four hours

00:49.000 --> 00:50.460
until it was all tender.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.880
I obviously had to taste test along the way

00:52.880 --> 00:54.700
cause it smelled so good.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.120
Once my meat was fall apart tender,

00:57.120 --> 00:58.360
I shredded it all up

00:58.360 --> 01:01.240
and then cut up some onion and cilantro,

01:01.240 --> 01:02.680
and then it was time to assemble.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.080
I grab my corn tortillas,

01:04.080 --> 01:05.440
dip them in that consomme,

01:05.440 --> 01:07.320
put them in the pan with some Oaxaca cheese,

01:07.320 --> 01:09.180
but you can also use mozzarella,

01:09.520 --> 01:10.440
that shredded beef,

01:10.440 --> 01:12.040
some onion and cilantro,

01:12.040 --> 01:13.360
and once they were ready to eat,

01:13.360 --> 01:14.240
I dip them in that

01:14.240 --> 01:15.400
consume, and. Oh,

01:15.400 --> 01:16.120
my gosh, guys,

01:16.120 --> 01:17.481
this was so good.
