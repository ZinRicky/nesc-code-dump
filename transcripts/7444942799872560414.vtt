00:01.560 --> 00:05.240
so heres a list of all the green flags in men

00:05.241 --> 00:08.680
starting off with No. 1- if he makes good eye contact

00:08.681 --> 00:10.640
men who aren't afraid to hold eye contact with you

00:10.641 --> 00:12.744
and you can stare into their dreamy eyes

00:12.745 --> 00:14.904
and they reciprocate that same energy back

00:14.905 --> 00:16.128
that is a huge green flag!

00:16.129 --> 00:18.208
No. 2- has basic manners

00:18.209 --> 00:21.488
he's polite he knows to say please and thank you

00:21.489 --> 00:24.328
he's nice to others especially service worker

00:24.347 --> 00:25.787
and he holds the door open for you

00:25.788 --> 00:27.437
that is a true gentleman 

00:27.438 --> 00:29.947
No.3 he laughs or smiles a lot

00:29.948 --> 00:31.727
he's generally just carefree

00:31.728 --> 00:35.607
if he can lighten the mood with a joke or he's high energy and giggling

00:35.608 --> 00:37.367
then that is a huge green flag

00:37.368 --> 00:40.327
4 he ask you personal questions about yourself

00:40.328 --> 00:41.607
it's not just surface level

00:41.785 --> 00:44.945
it means he's genuine and he just wants to get to know you on a deeper level

00:44.946 --> 00:47.025
No. 5- when a man doesn't rush you

00:47.026 --> 00:49.145
when men let you live at your own pace

00:49.146 --> 00:51.485
usually means they're chill and they go with the flow

00:51.591 --> 00:53.071
and they know when to compromise

00:53.072 --> 00:55.371
No. six- when he matches your energy

00:55.372 --> 00:57.011
if you can be weird around him

00:57.012 --> 01:00.771
and he matches that same energy back and is as equally weird

01:00.772 --> 01:03.891
that's a huge green flag when he allows you to be yourself

01:04.019 --> 01:05.805
and he shows his playful side with you
