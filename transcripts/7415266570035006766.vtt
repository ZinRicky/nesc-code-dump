00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.160
So this is our little school room on the farm,

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:04.281
and I really needed something to warm the place up.

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:05.601
This washable rug,

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:08.561
it just makes the room just feel so much more cosy and inviting

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:09.981
while we're doing our school work.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.240
This room is also with the outside dogs hang out.

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.741
So this needs to be a washable rug in this room.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.440
I just love how smooth and soft this rug is.

00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:19.841
It also has this non slip rubber backing

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:21.581
so that the rug stays in place.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.680
This rug is super easy to clean with a vacuum or a broom.

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:26.561
And of course, after we got done with our school work,

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:28.921
one of the outside dogs decided to pee on the rug.

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:32.361
So first testing to see how easy it is to wash.

00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:34.601
This was super easy. This is the extra large size.

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:36.421
It was easy to get into my machine.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.680
It washed well and dried well.

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:40.481
I had the rug put back down now

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:42.201
and it looks even better than it did before.

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:44.781
If you have dogs and kids, this rug is a must.
