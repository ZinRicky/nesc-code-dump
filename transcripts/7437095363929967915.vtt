00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.120
You know, I get this a lot when I talk about canning,

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:05.321
and I think it's because we fear what we don't fully understand.

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:07.681
But the good news is that knowledge replaces that fear.

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:09.361
Our grannies and the grannies before them

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:10.681
knew how to preserve their harvest.

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:13.121
They had to preserve their harvest because they were eating regionally

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:14.701
and they were eating seasonally.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.600
Grocery stores were not a thing.

00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:18.001
And while grocery stores are a beautiful and wonderful gift,

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.121
they are also the cause of so many people being out of touch

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:21.081
of where their food comes from.

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:23.881
Subsequently, the skills of learning to preserve have been lost.

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:26.761
And I do think that certain alphabet agencies do fear mongering

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:28.281
what you can and can't do in canning

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:30.841
because they want you to be reliant on the system that they've created.

00:00:30.842 --> 00:00:34.041
Food grown from your own backyard and canned in your own home

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:36.801
is 1,000% safer than anything you can get at a grocery store.

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:38.841
Variants is always your greatest asset in life.

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:40.401
So if you're worried about canning,

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:42.861
come along with me and let me teach you how to can.
