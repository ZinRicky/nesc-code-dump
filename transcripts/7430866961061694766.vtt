00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
The reason we keep seeing people talking about

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.681
a male loneliness epidemic

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:05.361
isn't because men are actually lonely.

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:06.521
It's because a lot of men

00:00:06.522 --> 00:00:09.461
are unable to have emotionally intimate relationships.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.660
If you don't have emotional intelligence,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.280
you're not gonna be able to be emotionally vulnerable.

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.361
If you can't be emotionally vulnerable,

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:18.761
you're not gonna be able to be emotionally intimate.

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:21.861
And if you can't have emotional intimacy within your relationships,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.680
you are never gonna have a deep,

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:26.681
meaningful connection. And if you don't have deep,

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:30.261
meaningful connections, you're going to feel alone.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.180
The good news is that emotional intelligence skills can be taught.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.660
The bad news is, it is not your romantic partner's job to teach you.
