00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
I've been hearing a lot about micro feminism

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:03.961
then I wanna add some of the feministy

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:08.641
micro feminisms that I like to drop in to everyday conversation.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.481
Firstly, teach a man to fish

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:13.801
this actually comes up a lot

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:18.601
men like to bring up the classic idiom slash moral teaching

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:22.081
teacher manta fish and you whenever men bring this up,

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:25.441
which is weirdly often and I'm sure you'll start noticing it

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:26.801
just the way that if you get a car

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:27.921
you start seeing it everywhere

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:30.641
you will start noticing how often men bring up the teacher

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:31.841
manta fish analogy.

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:35.721
I interrupt and say teacher manta fish and you emasculate him

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:39.481
I think that this is a far more superior moral teaching to any other

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:41.361
teacher man to fish metaphor.

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:44.921
It is far more accurate than any other one I've ever heard.

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:48.681
The teacher man to fish metaphor was clearly invented by men

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:52.561
because women know that if you actually tried to teach a man to fish

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:56.681
as a woman, he would feel emasculated and you might die

00:00:56.682 --> 00:01:00.241
or at least you would suffer from being patronized and

00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:02.681
or kicked out of the fishing club.

00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:04.601
The next one is quite simple.

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:07.441
I merely just asked men to bring me things

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:09.321
and when they specify what things

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:12.101
I say I don't know things

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.280
the next one uh, is just that whenever god comes up,

00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:20.041
I refer to her as she or they for example,

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:21.801
what star sign are you? Me.

00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:23.641
I'm a Gemini. Oh,

00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:25.161
so you're a two faced bitch?

00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:27.641
No, I believe that when god made me a Gemini,

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:30.461
she meant it in a multifaceted bisexual way.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600
Next one. What were you wearing?

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:34.841
When men tell me a story where,

00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:36.941
you know, something happened to them that was unpleasant,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.320
I simply ask, well,

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:40.721
what were you wearing? You can expand on this.

00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:41.921
Why were you there? Were you drunk?

00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:43.561
It sounds like you're asking for it.

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:44.641
You get the picture.

00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:47.761
The next thing is that if I hear a man talking in an angry voice

00:01:47.762 --> 00:01:51.961
like on the radio or on TV or just in general,

00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:54.621
I just simply refer to him as shrill.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.038
Does the trick.
