00:00.040 --> 00:02.280
As soon as it gets a little colder outside,

00:02.281 --> 00:04.361
all I crave is comforting foods.

00:04.362 --> 00:07.761
So for dinner tonight, I decided to cook some comfort meals.

00:07.762 --> 00:10.441
I started by making a Butternut squash soup.

00:10.442 --> 00:12.521
Took the seeds out of my Butternut squash,

00:12.522 --> 00:13.601
cut some onions,

00:13.602 --> 00:17.121
season it before popping it in the oven for about 30 minutes.

00:17.122 --> 00:19.001
As soon as everything's caramelized,

00:19.002 --> 00:23.401
I let that cool, and in the meantime I got started on my beef roast.

00:23.402 --> 00:26.161
My favorite part of a roast are the soft carrots,

00:26.162 --> 00:28.441
so I made sure to add extra carrots,

00:28.442 --> 00:30.081
cut those into large chunks,

00:30.082 --> 00:33.481
half my potatoes. Also cut up some onion and garlic.

00:33.482 --> 00:34.801
Once all of that was prepped,

00:34.802 --> 00:37.981
I seared off my roast before setting that aside

00:38.000 --> 00:40.880
deglazing with some red wine and some beef stock,

00:40.881 --> 00:43.021
I added in my garlic, carrots,

00:43.040 --> 00:45.200
my roast, and some potatoes.

00:45.201 --> 00:47.161
I found some herbs in the fridge,

00:47.162 --> 00:51.041
made sure to season it before putting it in the oven for five hours.

00:51.042 --> 00:52.281
Once that was in the oven,

00:52.282 --> 00:55.961
I made my bread rolls. Let those rise until they doubled in size,

00:55.962 --> 00:57.841
which was about two hours today.

00:57.842 --> 00:59.761
I also love a good fall salad,

00:59.762 --> 01:04.201
so I use some kale apple. I also made a mustard vinaigrette.

01:04.202 --> 01:06.421
I assembled it by adding some rocket,

01:06.520 --> 01:08.200
sliced up apples, pomegranate,

01:08.201 --> 01:10.681
and feta cheese. Once my dough was ready,

01:10.682 --> 01:13.821
I punched out the air, divided it into portions,

01:13.840 --> 01:15.720
flatten those out, rolled them up,

01:15.721 --> 01:19.281
and let those poof for thirty Minutes before baking them,

01:19.282 --> 01:22.801
I moved on to blending up all my Butternut squash and onion

01:22.802 --> 01:25.281
before thinning it out with some more chicken stock,

01:25.282 --> 01:27.301
adding some sage and parsley,

01:27.400 --> 01:29.880
slowly letting that simmer on the stove.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.121
For dessert, I made some fresh caramel

01:32.122 --> 01:33.881
drizzled out on top of some apples

01:33.882 --> 01:36.181
with some chocolate and crushed up pretzels.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.520
I put that in the fridge and our dinner was done. This was so divine.
