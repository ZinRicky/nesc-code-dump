I have 24 hours at home before I fly to New York to meet my husband,

00:04.201 --> 00:07.241
so I decided to meal prep some things for my kids

00:07.242 --> 00:09.681
to make meal time just a little bit easier.

00:09.682 --> 00:11.361
Lately they've been loving pomelo,

00:11.362 --> 00:15.441
so I prepped some of that before moving on to making some banana bread.

00:15.442 --> 00:18.401
Mumble specifically requested chocolate in her banana bread,

00:18.402 --> 00:21.201
so obviously I made a chocolate chip banana bread,

00:21.202 --> 00:22.761
mashed up some ripe bananas,

00:22.762 --> 00:24.721
added some maple syrup and egg,

00:24.722 --> 00:28.641
some flour, gave that a really good mix before chopping up my chocolate

00:28.642 --> 00:32.521
and also adding that. Poured it into my buttered loaf pan

00:32.522 --> 00:36.961
and baked it for about 50 minutes to an hour before letting it cool.

00:36.962 --> 00:39.361
In the meantime, I got started on some pizza dough.

00:39.362 --> 00:42.441
I love having this in the fridge for a quick weeknight dinner

00:42.442 --> 00:44.721
with some fresh tomato sauce and mozzarella.

00:44.722 --> 00:46.961
I let that rise for about an hour and a half

00:46.962 --> 00:49.321
while I got started on my protein option.

00:49.322 --> 00:52.361
My mom used to make this cabbage and carrot ground beef,

00:52.362 --> 00:54.161
which is still one of my favorite things

00:54.162 --> 00:56.041
and now one of my kids favorites.

00:56.042 --> 00:58.001
I sauteed my cabbage and carrot

00:58.002 --> 01:01.281
before adding my fried up ground beef and a splash of beef stock

01:01.282 --> 01:02.441
to that. This point

01:02.442 --> 01:06.121
my pizza dough was ready to get portioned out and put in the fridge.

01:06.122 --> 01:08.561
My kids have been loving an arugula salad lately,

01:08.562 --> 01:11.641
but it has to be with a very specific lemon Dressing.

01:11.642 --> 01:13.641
So I made some to keep in the fridge.

01:13.642 --> 01:15.121
Just combine some lemon juice,

01:15.122 --> 01:16.121
olive oil, salt,

01:16.122 --> 01:17.321
pepper, some herbs.

01:17.322 --> 01:20.801
Gave that a good mix for moving on to the last thing I was prepping,

01:20.802 --> 01:22.521
which was a broccoli cheddar soup,

01:22.522 --> 01:24.161
which my sister really wanted.

01:24.162 --> 01:27.801
Sauteed my carrot, onion and celery before adding a pinch of salt,

01:27.802 --> 01:29.161
some flour, milk,

01:29.162 --> 01:32.081
vegetable stock, and obviously cheddar cheese.

01:32.082 --> 01:34.361
I let that simmer, and once that came together,

01:34.362 --> 01:36.968
I took that off the heat, and we were all good to go.
