00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.340
So I just got my Halloween nails done.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.200
I put these little stars on them

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:07.721
because tonight I'm going to my friend Andrea's birthday.

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:09.561
She's doing it at a magic show,

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:11.841
and it is costume required.

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:14.241
So look at the mood board that she sent us.

00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:16.821
This is the vibe for her whole party.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.520
It's, like, mystical, magical.

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:20.761
She's a Halloween baby, and she is a peacock,

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:24.841
just like me. So the girl is going to be dressed to the nine,

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:26.401
so I have to show up.

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:28.801
So I thought these were really appropriate because I'm gonna go as,

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:30.701
like, a sorceress,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.660
kind of mystical witch lady.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.680
Um, I'll show you the costume later,

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:38.361
but it's going to be so much fun.

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:41.041
I haven't been to a magic show since I was 6,

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:42.761
so I have no idea what to expect.

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:44.041
I'm gonna take you along with me

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:46.281
because this is a really cool event to do in Charleston.

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:49.261
I've never heard of it, and I cannot wait to go.
