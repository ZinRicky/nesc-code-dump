00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.640
7, the average number of times

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:06.001
a woman goes back to the man that abused her.

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:09.001
And the average number of times the world fails her with phrases like,

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.341
I don't believe you, or at least he didn't hit you.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.040
7, the average number of times a woman returns to hell

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.121
because instead of trying to understand her,

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:20.781
we condemn her for escaping.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.840
Because instead of asking questions,

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:26.101
we ask her to stay silent in the name of keeping the peace.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.980
Seven times she has to learn that people don't take sides,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.040
that speaking out against his lies won't open people's eyes.

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:35.601
And the number of times she learns to dismiss her experience

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.301
because the rest of the world isn't brave enough to see it.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.460
Seven times there's a chance she doesn't get to try again.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.800
Seven times

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.481
she goes back to the place she should be praised for leaving.

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:47.241
And seven times

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:50.301
she has to fight for support when she's fighting just to stand.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.040
Seven times

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:55.321
we teach her to return instead of teaching ourselves how to save her.

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:55.921
Seven times

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:58.501
we teach abusers that their actions don't have consequences.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.600
Because seven times we'd rather side with them than admit that

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:04.601
the reason a woman returns to the man she should see as a threat

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:06.921
is because instead of stepping in to protect her,

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:08.421
we try to stay out of it.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.800
Instead of understanding the battle she fought to walk out that door,

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:15.157
we tell her the war wasn't Real seven times.
