00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.400
Crazy, call me psycho,

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.441
call me whatever you want,

00:00:02.442 --> 00:00:04.601
but I can't be the only one who does this.

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:06.081
I don't have any kids,

00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:08.841
so my partner is not a dad.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:09.641
But guess what?

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:10.881
Father's Day is coming up,

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:14.441
and I am for sure getting him a Daddy's Day gift,

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:16.041
so to speak. I have no shame.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:17.681
My love language is gift giving.

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:21.961
I will take any opportunity I can to make someone feel special

00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:22.921
and see a dad

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.561
or a father. A father.

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:26.121
But, I mean, he's my daddy.

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:30.221
So let's make it more socially acceptable to give your daddy.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.360
I'm honestly

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:35.441
just making him a little basket of things that I know he needs. Socks,

00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:38.261
boxers, a notebook, and a little card.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.240
Because I just want to make him feel special.

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:41.361
May not be a father,

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:43.321
he sure as heck is my daddy.

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:45.041
Okay, so nothing crazy here.

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.261
Him, a notebook,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.520
pairs of socks,

00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:49.681
because he always goes through socks,

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:51.641
underwear, and these shoes. Basket.

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:56.821
I'm just gonna throw this in here and see how it looks.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.920
There you have it.

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:02.261
Just a couple little things for Daddy Day.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.780
Oh, my goodness.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.240
You like it? I love it, baby. Awesome.

00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:10.501
You look really good.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.760
Thank you. You know,

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.461
I'm gonna try these on right away. Let's go.
