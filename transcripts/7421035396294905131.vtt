00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.480
Real food, we eat in a week.

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:02.941
As a large family,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.280
I cook a lot from scratch and most of our food is homemade.

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:08.981
We do eat out occasionally when we're in town,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.000
um, mostly for lunch and stuff like that.

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:11.481
So, yeah,

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:13.601
both of our meals are cooked at home.

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:16.081
We strive to use Whole Foods

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.321
and foods that we prepare ourselves from scratch

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:22.721
from simple ingredients. I try to buy organic produce,

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.681
but that's something that's not a huge deal for me.

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:26.941
We do grow a lot of our own produce as well.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.000
My main focus is to eat food that's not been processed

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.981
and to grow as much of our own food and meat as possible.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.000
When gardening, we don't use pesticides or herbicides,

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.901
and we also don't spray our yard with any unnatural fertilizers,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.600
including the grass. Um,

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.161
we do this as we have our chickens free ranging

00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:46.321
and our cow free ranging,

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:49.121
so we do not want them to ingest any unnecessary chemicals,

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:53.041
herbicides or pesticides. Here I'm making my absolute favourite cookies,

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:54.481
the cookies that started it all.

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:56.721
This is the very first recipe I made from scratch

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.581
and I still make it 10 years later.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.800
The ingredients have much to improve since I first started this recipe.

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:04.501
I use my own low butter here,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.520
the best flour I can get at the time,

00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:08.381
and the best brown sugar.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.520
We started canning from the garden some spaghetti sauce.

00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:15.441
We normally buy Rao's. If I don't Have any canned sauces?

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:16.541
But this year

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.720
I really wanted to make sure we have enough canned sauce

00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:20.881
to offer for the winner. So

00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:22.801
I'm starting at this little task

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:24.641
of counting as much sauce as possible.

00:01:24.642 --> 00:01:26.381
And we ate some of this for dinner.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.460
The kids absolutely loved it.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.880
Making and turning your own pasta sauce is so easy.

00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:36.901
I don't even know why I purchased it for so many years.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.920
But knowing exactly what's in the sauce

00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:41.141
and tweaking it for your own preference

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.500
is just the best thing you can do for yourself.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.720
This week we have some salmon.

00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:47.481
We don't normally eat salmon that much,

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.861
but if I eat fish, I do prefer to eat salmon.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.400
We then ate some steaks. Um,

00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:54.121
I think we should revise it too, though.

00:01:54.122 --> 00:01:55.201
I can't remember. But anyway,

00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:57.961
we ate some steaks. This is from the cow that we normally buy.

00:01:57.962 --> 00:02:01.041
About half a cow a year. Here's some raw butter.

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:02.561
We go through a lot of butter.

00:02:02.562 --> 00:02:04.381
I do still buy some butter,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.460
but can't keep up. But I'm making butter every week.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.580
Here's some more chicken. We have a lot of chicken in the freezer.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.760
My favorite pot roast. I love fall and winter,

00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:17.221
so I can make as much pot roast possible.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.780
It is just my favourite, um,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.120
good feeling home cooked meal.

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:24.581
It just gives me all the good comfy vibes.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.740
I love to add Worcestershire sauce into the stock that I made for this

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.000
Is absolutely delicious.

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.341
I use some bone broth that I made when we got our cow,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.620
and this just fell apart. It was so delicious.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.440
Another go to for us is pancakes.

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:43.681
If the kids are hungry and breakfast,

00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:44.661
lunch, or dinner,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.260
pancakes solves that problem.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.720
I'm gonna top this with some delicious

00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:51.501
organic maple syrup that I got from Sam's Club.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.640
Um. Yep.

00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:54.821
And that was another week of home cooked meals.
