00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.180
Let's put together some Nature Explorer backpacks for my kids.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.400
So I'm hiding in my dining room right now

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:06.961
because I'm trying to put something together for the kids.

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:09.921
That's a surprise that they're just upstairs,

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:13.661
but I'm putting together little Nature Explorer backpacks for them.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.480
First off, I got these cute little kids size backpacks on Amazon.

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:19.481
Each kid is gonna get a pair of, like,

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:20.421
outdoor gloves,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.100
a set of binoculars, a magnifying glass,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.640
and a couple of these little specimen jars.

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.201
That is a fake spider that I came with.

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:31.281
So everything's just gonna go in the little bag.

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:32.521
And this is a perfect gift.

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:35.441
If you have a kid who's super into nature and hiking

00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:37.021
and exploring the outdoors,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.720
you can find pre made ones.

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:41.001
But I really wanted to be able to pick the different things

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:44.021
that I put in. Knowing my kids and what they're into,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.240
I thought about also adding in, like,

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:46.721
a little, like,

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:49.481
bird watching guide or an insect guide

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.521
or a plant identifying guide

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:55.141
to kind of lead their play in their exploration a little bit, too.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.140
Just an idea. So now my kids are ready for their next outdoor adventure.
