00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.440
on Wednesday the Supreme Court heard oral arguments

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:05.481
about whether or not states can refuse to provide

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:08.601
abortions to women whose health is in grave danger

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:10.761
that is where we are at right now

00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:13.281
case involves Idaho's strict total abortion ban

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:17.961
which says that patients can only receive abortions if their life is at danger

00:00:17.962 --> 00:00:19.941
if they are literally about to die

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.320
but see there's this federal law from the 90s called EMTALA

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:24.441
and EMTALA says

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:28.081
that if a patient comes to the hospital with an emergent medical condition

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:30.241
the hospital needs to stabilize that patient

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:31.361
so for example

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:34.881
if a pregnant patient comes to the hospital at risk of septic shock

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:36.121
uncontrolled hemorrhaging

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:37.041
loss of organs

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:38.441
loss of future fertility

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:41.161
and an abortion is what that patient wants

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:44.161
and it would stabilize that patient's condition

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:45.881
the hospital must provide it

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:47.681
see how the federal law is more broad

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:51.361
the state law only kicks in if required to save the woman's life

00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:53.421
not necessarily her health

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.820
but the broader federal law trumps state law

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.120
so what's Idaho to do

00:00:58.121 --> 00:00:59.521
Idaho's like look

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:00.921
when you overturned Roe v

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:01.841
Wade and Dobbs v

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:02.961
Jackson Women's Health

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.641
you gave abortion rights back to the states

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:07.041
so leave us alone

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:09.621
we can deny women healthcare if we want to

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.360
oral arguments

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:11.921
Justice Sotomayor was like okay

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:13.281
well under your theory

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.281
then a state could also pass a law

00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:18.881
saying that women cannot receive abortions under any conditions

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:20.841
even if necessary to save her life

00:01:20.842 --> 00:01:22.641
the attorney for the Biden administration

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:23.721
Elizabeth Preloger

00:01:23.722 --> 00:01:24.801
was like yes

00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:26.441
states do get to decide an abortion

00:01:26.442 --> 00:01:28.041
which states have done

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:32.241
but you don't get to criminalize essential healthcare like under EMTALA

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:37.481
states have never been able to criminalize or prevent hospitals from providing

00:01:37.482 --> 00:01:39.861
necessary emergent healthcare

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.440
Preloger and the courts

00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:45.841
three Liberal justices point out the horror of accepting Idaho's legal argument

00:01:45.842 --> 00:01:47.521
women will unnecessarily suffer

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:48.601
women will die

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:51.041
women will have to utilize unnecessary resources

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:53.721
like take a helicopter just to get to a state

00:01:53.722 --> 00:01:55.041
just to get basic care

00:01:55.042 --> 00:01:56.721
and as Preloger points out

00:01:56.722 --> 00:01:59.201
all in the pursuit of nothing

00:01:59.202 --> 00:01:59.761
doing this

00:01:59.762 --> 00:02:04.061
when there's really no possible upside in these situations for the fetus

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.620
and somehow it's not entirely clear how the justices are going to rule

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.000
we can safely assume that the courts

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:10.401
three Liberal justices

00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:11.601
Sotomayor, Kagan

00:02:11.602 --> 00:02:15.081
and Ketanji Brown Jackson will side with the Biden administration

00:02:15.082 --> 00:02:17.881
and that based on everything we know about them and oral arguments

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:19.321
that Thomas Gorsuch

00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:21.061
and Alito will side with Idaho

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.480
so that leaves our reproductive fate with Coney Barrett

00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:24.881
Kavanaugh and Roberts

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:26.521
who weren't 100% transparent

00:02:26.522 --> 00:02:28.601
and oral arguments with how they're going to rule

00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:31.161
but that is definitely not three people

00:02:31.162 --> 00:02:34.061
who you want deciding your reproductive fate

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.520
okay let's pause

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.441
did this help you understand what the case is about

00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:38.801
what questions do you have

00:02:38.802 --> 00:02:40.101
let me know in the comments
