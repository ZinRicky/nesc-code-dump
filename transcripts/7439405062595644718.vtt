00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.560
I got a phone call from my post office early this morning

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:04.001
that our babies had arrived.

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.121
With my ADHD brain I totally forgot that I even ordered chicks.

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:09.201
But I always have stuff on hand ready to go.

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:12.081
I need to run to town and get some wood chips to put in the bottom.

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:14.601
Or I might use pine pellets this time.

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:18.581
We'll see. I ordered Cornish cross this time from Hoover Hatchery.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.640
Normally we get Freedom Rangers

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:24.041
and they can pretty much survive just on pasture

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:25.481
once they're out of the brooder,

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:28.241
which I love, so it doesn't cost us that much money to raise them.

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:29.401
But we're in the winter period

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:31.121
so I decided to go with Cornish cross.

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:33.461
I'm gonna feed them and they're gonna be expensive to feed.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.800
That's why I only got I think 20 or 30.

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.201
I honestly can't remember what I ordered.

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:38.921
Have to look on the email and open the box.

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:39.721
I was like oh my gosh,

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:41.281
none of them died in the shipping,

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:43.981
which is pretty cool. Normally we lose one or two,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.360
but then I realise one of them did die,

00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:48.741
but these are just like savage dinosaurs

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.880
and they decided to eat their little friend.

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:54.341
So their little friend didn't die for nothing.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.120
It nourished these chicks on their little trip from Pennsylvania.

00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:00.281
I believe. I set their brood up in the shed.

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:02.881
Normally I use the trailer cause we normally brood hundreds at a time,

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:06.041
but I Decided to just do a small amount this time over the winter.

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:08.961
I'm gonna head over to the barn to check on everybody else.

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:10.421
Here is Miss Daisy.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.160
I haven't been in the chicken coop since the day before yesterday,

00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:15.601
so we probably have quite a few eggs waiting for me.

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:18.721
Went for this really weird period of having hardly any eggs all summer.

00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:20.021
Hi, Miss Rex.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.600
So I have one of those, like,

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.881
portable building, really cute chicken cubes

00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:25.981
that I bought from one of those side of the road places.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.440
And with the amount of chickens that we have,

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:28.441
it's just not really useful.

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:29.641
So I end up getting rid of that.

00:01:29.642 --> 00:01:31.601
And I just converted part of the barn into this cute

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:32.961
little chicken coop area. Now,

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:36.681
this is a Freedom Ranger. She was supposed to be in the freezer,

00:01:36.682 --> 00:01:37.881
but they started laying eggs,

00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:40.961
and I just couldn't. So I left three,

00:01:40.962 --> 00:01:42.801
three or four of these Freedom Ranger hands.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:43.761
And they lay a lot of eggs.

00:01:43.762 --> 00:01:46.161
And she's huge, but she lays really big,

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:47.121
nice eggs. Now,

00:01:47.122 --> 00:01:48.921
this black cobble Moran was giving me the side eye.

00:01:48.922 --> 00:01:51.021
I just knew she was gonna peck me.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.440
She didn't want me to take her eggs.

00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:52.841
I think, though,

00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:55.081
she's gone broody. But we'll see.

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:56.941
We'll see if she's around the coop tomorrow.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.440
Now, these are the Turkey hands that are kinda lonely

00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:02.701
since Mister Tom ended up in the freezer.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.360
But lessons Learned. They definitely wanna get Bread.

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:07.741
Maybe there'll be a wild Turkey around that will, um,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.040
get the job done.

00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:12.281
The geese are lovin the fresh stock tank water I just filled up.

00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:13.421
So, you know,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.400
you can't be too long with the fresh,

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.481
clean water. They need to get,

00:02:16.482 --> 00:02:19.181
jump straight in and shit in there.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.340
So put the eggs inside and pop them in my new Mason Cash bowl,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.500
because I have so many eggs that I have nowhere to put them right now.
