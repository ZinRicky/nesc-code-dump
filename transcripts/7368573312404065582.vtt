00:00.000 --> 00:00.840
For breakfast today,

00:00.841 --> 00:03.881
I couldn't decide whether I wanted something sweet or savory,

00:03.882 --> 00:06.001
but I did know that I want bread and butter,

00:06.002 --> 00:08.201
so I made two variations of each.

00:08.202 --> 00:11.561
I started by scoring my blueberry lemon sourdough loaf

00:11.562 --> 00:14.201
that has been proofing in the fridge for a couple days,

00:14.202 --> 00:17.001
placing it in my Dutch oven before adding some ice,

00:17.002 --> 00:18.001
popping the lid on,

00:18.002 --> 00:20.041
and baking it for 45 minutes.

00:20.042 --> 00:21.201
While that was baking,

00:21.202 --> 00:23.901
I decided to get started on my butter.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.940
Whipped some heavy cream until my solid butter

00:26.960 --> 00:28.760
separated from my liquid buttermilk,

00:28.761 --> 00:31.321
and then I squeezed as much buttermilk out

00:31.322 --> 00:34.561
before running it under cold water and setting it aside

00:34.562 --> 00:35.801
for the savory version.

00:35.802 --> 00:38.281
I wanted to make a ramp and chive butter,

00:38.282 --> 00:42.061
so I blanched my ramps and then chopped them up really finely,

00:42.160 --> 00:45.680
did the same with my chives, and then realized that my bread was ready.

00:45.681 --> 00:49.081
So I pulled my blueberry loaf out and scored my plain sourdough

00:49.082 --> 00:50.721
before popping that one in the oven.

00:50.722 --> 00:53.201
For about 50 minutes that was baking,

00:53.202 --> 00:54.561
I combined my ramps,

00:54.562 --> 00:57.401
chives, and some flaky sea salt with my butter

00:57.402 --> 00:59.681
before rolling it up in some wax paper.

00:59.682 --> 01:00.961
I placed that in the fridge

01:00.962 --> 01:04.521
and moved on to making a sweet butter to go with my blueberry loaf.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.921
I decided on a browned maple vanilla salted butter,

01:07.922 --> 01:10.361
which is one of my favorite butters. Now,

01:10.362 --> 01:12.401
melted it down and then whisked it,

01:12.402 --> 01:13.641
and once it was ready,

01:13.642 --> 01:15.201
I placed On a plate

01:15.202 --> 01:18.521
I had some beautiful heirloom tomatoes that I was craving.

01:18.522 --> 01:21.121
So I added them to a plate with some olive oil, salt,

01:21.122 --> 01:23.681
pepper and some French radishes that I had,

01:23.682 --> 01:26.281
and pulled out my sourdough loaf and let it cool,

01:26.282 --> 01:27.721
and then breakfast was done.

01:27.722 --> 01:30.481
There's nothing better to me than a fresh loaf of bread

01:30.482 --> 01:31.561
with some butter on it.

01:31.562 --> 01:33.090
And this hit the spot.
