00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.540
Absolutely.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.280
And that's why they try to make fun of women for spilling the tea.

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:11.121
And they just mock these things to make us feel stupid about it.

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:13.601
So that the pick me girls immediately are like,

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:14.481
I don't gossip.

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:16.221
I'm not one of those girls.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.600
To give us another thing

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:20.381
to kind of tear us apart and divide us as women.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.680
And we need to remember gossiping not about each other,

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.921
but about what's going on between our relationships.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.681
And if some girls gonna try to steal your man,

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:30.041
honey, then he was gonna be taken one way or another.

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:31.641
He was never your man.

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:36.341
He was just a fucking asshole that was trying to take advantage of you.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.960
Consider her doing you a favor.

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:42.221
That's how men act when one dude hurts the other dude.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.720
You know, maybe they fight or have it out for a quick second,

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:47.001
but they're immediately like, bros before hoes.

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:48.961
But girls are the dummies that are like,

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:49.881
she took my man!

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.121
And getting all, like,

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:52.801
all emotional about it. Like, girl,

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:56.401
let it go. The line goes around the block.

00:00:56.402 --> 00:00:57.161
Do you know what I mean?

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:58.481
Like, exactly.

00:00:58.482 --> 00:00:59.481
Girls need to gossip,

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:02.621
spill the tea, and commune with each other.
