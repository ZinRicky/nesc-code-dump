00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.440
I think the permanence of internet has made people so afraid to be cringy

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:04.800
that everyone is the fucking same

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:05.520
myself include

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:09.000
but like everyone on the internet is always policing everyone else

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:13.560
that makes it so hard to deviate from the very narrow idea of the norm

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:14.320
and like the thing is

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:17.247
let's say someone makes a cringy video on the internet 

00:00:17.248 --> 00:00:17.940
fine whatever

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.640
but that's not the only consequence

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:21.920
you have to worry about someone taking that video

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:22.960
putting it on a different app

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:24.680
having a bunch of people making fun of you 

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:25.640
going viral on the other app

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:26.800
maybe it upsets people

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:28.840
then people are messaging your job

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:29.840
telling your school

00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:31.960
like literally trying to ruin your life

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:34.680
because they disagreed with you about something that you said

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:35.440
that is insane

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:37.640
like it is insane that we society have gotten that place

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.840
like everything has become so palatable

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:40.280
and again I

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:41.720
I know that I've done this myself

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:46.320
like my (PUBLIC) politics in the last few years because my platform has grown

00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:49.000
have become so much more like milquetoast 

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:52.400
and I've stopped speaking radically because I'm always pissing people off

00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:53.480
it gets exhausting

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:55.440
and it's like everyone has become the same

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.120
we don't give people the space to like

00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:00.160
explore their different opinions or different thoughts

00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:02.740
like it was don't give people the space to be wrong

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.240
I am a verbal processor

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:05.760
so I come on this app and I just like

00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:06.760
I talk that like I

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:08.840
the way that I think through things is by talking them out

00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:09.720
so yeah I

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:11.200
I'm wrong often

00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:12.280
I will admit but like

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:15.760
y'all make it so difficult to be wrong on the internet

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:16.880
because the second you're wrong

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:17.822
you get crucified
