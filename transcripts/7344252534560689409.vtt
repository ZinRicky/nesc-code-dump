00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.360
I posted a vlog the other day

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:03.341
sharing a particularly busy day in the life

00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:04.401
 of the mother of three

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:05.721
and when I say particularly busy

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:07.281
that day was out the fkn gate

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:08.641
and if that day was a crazy day

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.081
then this day is gonna be the polar opposite

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:11.593
so because I don't really feel like leaving 

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:12.521
the house or doing anything

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:13.961
unless I absolutely have to

00:00:13.962 --> 00:00:16.041
so come spend a regular day in the life with me

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:17.660
my husband got up early and took the dog 

00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:19.161
for a run before heading off into work

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:21.281
and so I just had to deal with everything else

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:22.601
I gave the kids their breakfast

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:23.881
made their lunch packed their bags

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:25.330
got them ready for school and dropped 

00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:26.361
them off before coming home

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:27.281
and dealing with some admin

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:28.361
I caught up in my emails

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.121
took a zoom meeting

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.001
ordered my groceries

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.521
and edited some content before ripping into the household chores

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:34.841
which I was really hoping might do themselves

00:00:34.842 --> 00:00:36.081
and the whole time I was making the beds

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:38.161
I was struggling with the urge just to hop back in

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:40.401
because I don't know what's going on with Goldie at the moment

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:42.081
but she seems to be having a sleep regression

00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:43.881
Goldie is my two and a half year old vizsla 

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:46.521
and lately she's been waking up five or six times a night

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:48.161
and sometimes she'll just come and stare at me

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:49.041
and I don't know why

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:50.481
anyway I'm extremely tired

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:51.041
and it reminds me

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:52.881
of that feeling that you get when you have a Newborn

00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:55.241
which is why I am not gonna be having anymore Newborns

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:56.766
I opened a PR pack from Lorna Jane 

00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:58.161
before deciding to have a shower

00:00:58.162 --> 00:00:59.761
and my shower turned into an everything shower

00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:01.321
which even normally happens during the day

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:02.921
but I have a photoshoot tomorrow with BraveFace 

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:05.521
so I justified it to myself by telling myself it was work

00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:06.881
and my husband's not getting home till late

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:08.681
and by the time i get through the afternoon with the kids

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.481
I figured I'm not gonna wanna do any of this shit

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:11.481
so I might as well just do it

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:13.257
I raced out and pick the kids up from school 

00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:14.561
before dealing with the groceries

00:01:14.562 --> 00:01:15.401
dealing with the kitchen

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:16.601
and then dealing with the bathroom

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:19.125
and this is one of my non negotiable daily clean areas 

00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:21.561
I mean obviously the kitchen gets cleaned multiple times a day

00:01:21.562 --> 00:01:23.329
but the bathroom will get a surface clean 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.761
once a day and a deep clean once a week

00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:25.721
and then please be assured

00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:28.241
I thoroughly washed my hands before starting on the dinner

00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:30.361
and then this is one of my lazy girl go to dinners

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:32.441
which I know the kids will eat every single time

00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:34.321
and that I make when I really can't be fkd

00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:35.121
making a proper dinner

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:36.667
and it's gonna look like a proper dinner and 

00:01:36.668 --> 00:01:37.561
taste like a proper dinner

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:38.241
but I swear to god

00:01:38.242 --> 00:01:39.561
it takes like 10 minutes to make

00:01:39.562 --> 00:01:42.441
I've got a variation of this saved under my Easy Recipes playlist

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:42.921
so basically

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:43.681
it's just onions

00:01:43.682 --> 00:01:44.881
mushrooms chicken herbs

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:45.641
salt and pepper

00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:46.761
lemon juice capers

00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:47.641
a bit of mustard

00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:48.801
chicken stock and cream

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:50.721
and I just pop it in the oven for like an hour and a half

00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:51.681
stirring occasionally

00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:52.961
and it basically cooks itself

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:54.961
and I must have been feeling particularly maternal today

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:57.201
because my kids just absolutely adore these cookies

00:01:57.202 --> 00:01:59.041
so I decided to whip up a quick batch so that 

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:00.321
they could have a hot cookie for pudding

00:02:00.322 --> 00:02:02.161
let me know if you want the recipe for this by the way

00:02:02.162 --> 00:02:04.074
because I could make these with my eyes closed 

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:06.761
and again it's an easy recipe that takes extra no time

00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:07.441
and you will find

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:08.161
if you follow me

00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:10.921
that this is a consistent theme with a sort of food that I cook

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:11.761
it's gotta be quick

00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:12.761
it's gotta be easy

00:02:12.762 --> 00:02:13.921
and it's gonna be delicious

00:02:13.922 --> 00:02:15.001
cause we don't have the time

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:18.141
capacity or patience to fk around and be fancy over here

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.960
I finished the dinner off with a bag of spinach

00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:22.201
which disappeared into another dimension

00:02:22.202 --> 00:02:23.281
added my cooked pasta

00:02:23.282 --> 00:02:24.081
some Parmesan

00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:25.321
and some fresh chopped basil

00:02:25.322 --> 00:02:27.081
then I dished the kids up with a side of green beans

00:02:27.082 --> 00:02:27.681
cause I figured

00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:29.241
I'd eat later when my husband got home

00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:30.201
and for their treat of course

00:02:30.202 --> 00:02:31.161
they got a hot cookie

00:02:31.162 --> 00:02:33.361
and no hot cookie is complete without a cup of milk

00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:34.321
I got the babies clean

00:02:34.322 --> 00:02:35.241
read them their stories

00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:35.841
put them to sleep

00:02:35.842 --> 00:02:37.681
then I sat down and did some prep for tomorrow

00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:38.201
ate a cookie

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:39.539
and ignored my washing
