Here's some things I prepped to make my week just a little bit easier.

00:03.521 --> 00:05.081
My kids wanted some goldfish,

00:05.082 --> 00:06.521
so I prepped the dough for that

00:06.522 --> 00:09.761
and popped that in the fridge while I prepped all of my other things.

00:09.762 --> 00:12.361
Moved on to making some pancake dry mix

00:12.362 --> 00:14.641
that I just have to mix with some eggs and milk

00:14.642 --> 00:16.921
in the morning. And since my bananas weren't ripe,

00:16.922 --> 00:18.921
I popped them in the oven for a few minutes

00:18.922 --> 00:20.921
and then made some banana bread.

00:20.922 --> 00:22.601
My kids love banana bread.

00:22.602 --> 00:23.801
I don't know what it is about,

00:23.802 --> 00:26.721
it's always gone the same or the very next day.

00:26.722 --> 00:31.001
So I made a loaf of that before moving on to making some granola bars.

00:31.002 --> 00:34.041
These are really simple to make by combining some peanut butter,

00:34.042 --> 00:35.181
honey, oats,

00:35.200 --> 00:37.920
some chocolate. I also added some cacao powder

00:37.921 --> 00:40.201
and then put that in the fridge to chill

00:40.202 --> 00:42.561
while I got started on my apple sauce.

00:42.562 --> 00:44.401
I had an abundance of apples at home,

00:44.402 --> 00:47.061
so this is one of my favorite things to do with them.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.960
Cook them down with some water and a drizzle of maple syrup

00:49.961 --> 00:52.401
until they were the texture I wanted them to be

00:52.402 --> 00:55.521
before moving on to making some lemon grass meatballs.

00:55.522 --> 00:57.521
I chopped up some mint lemon grass,

00:57.522 --> 01:01.361
green onions, seasoned that up with some ginger garlic fish sauce,

01:01.362 --> 01:02.721
roll them into little balls,

01:02.722 --> 01:05.281
and then fried them off. Those were frying.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.961
I started on a quick little salad that I Like,

01:07.962 --> 01:09.721
to keep in the fridge to have.

01:09.722 --> 01:11.681
This time around, I did some kale,

01:11.682 --> 01:14.181
cucumbers, and some feta cheese,

01:14.200 --> 01:16.040
made a simple lemon vinaigrette,

01:16.041 --> 01:17.121
and then throughout the week,

01:17.122 --> 01:19.561
I'll pair it with whatever I'm craving.

01:19.562 --> 01:21.881
This point, I rolled out my goldfish dough

01:21.882 --> 01:25.321
and laid all of my tiny little goldfish onto a baking tray,

01:25.322 --> 01:27.961
and then pop them in the oven for about 10 minutes

01:27.962 --> 01:29.761
before pulling them out. Like,

01:29.762 --> 01:32.241
prepping at least one meal to have on hand.

01:32.242 --> 01:34.481
So this week, it was Thai fried rice.

01:34.482 --> 01:36.801
Lucky. And I have been loving fried rice lately,

01:36.802 --> 01:40.361
so this was perfect. And then it was time to put everything away.

01:40.362 --> 01:41.721
Started with my apple sauce,

01:41.722 --> 01:43.561
my goldfish, my banana bread,

01:43.562 --> 01:46.681
my Thai fried rice, my lemon grass meatballs,

01:46.682 --> 01:48.201
kale salad that I prepped.

01:48.202 --> 01:51.801
And then I cut up my granola bars that had been sitting in the fridge.

01:51.802 --> 01:55.041
I like cutting them up so it makes it easier to grab them.

01:55.042 --> 01:56.937
And this is everything we prepped.
