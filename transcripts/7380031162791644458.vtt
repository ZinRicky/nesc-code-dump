00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.040
Supreme Court is upholding our access to abortion pills,

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:06.041
and this is a huge win for all feminists across the nation.

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:07.261
Let's talk about it.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.880
The Supreme Court decided that the plaintiffs lacked status

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:14.321
standing to sue to remove beforprestone off the market.

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:17.441
Beforprestone was approved by the FDA over 20 years ago,

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:19.201
and in 2,023 alone,

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:19.681
the pills

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:24.481
accounted for over 60% of the abortions that happened in the US. Safe,

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:25.081
it's effective,

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:29.121
and it is a vital part of expanding reproductive health here in the US,

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:32.281
where one in 3 women who are of reproductive age

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.821
don't even have access to abortions.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.640
This means that abortion pills will remain

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:38.561
available in two of the largest pharmacy

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:39.561
chains in the US.

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:40.401
And additionally,

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:43.761
abortion pills will continue to be available to order by mail,

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:46.081
which is vital for many of the people who need it

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:47.961
in states where abortion pills have been banned.

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:50.081
It's a huge win for feminist across the nation.

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:51.121
But let us know what you think.
