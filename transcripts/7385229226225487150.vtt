00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.160
so many people dislike or hate old people

00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:05.240
now why is that

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:09.400
I have personally never found an old person/older person that I dislike

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:12.900
I think they are the sweetest nicest people ever

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.800
they have wisdom, smart

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:17.560
they're just wholesome and pure why

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:19.520
why are we disliking old people

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.640
why why do we call them boomers

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:22.969
Why are we so mean to them 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.480
I just went to the post office to send off a letter

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:28.160
I had the sweetest old man help me

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.160
who's so kind and so genuine

00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:33.160
it just made my day he just had such a good attitude

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:34.400
so I don't know

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.480
just remember guys

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:36.840
Theyâ€™re somebody's grandpa

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:39.880
somebody's grandma, mom, sister, brother

00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:45.280
we all need to respect older people and stop calling them boomers

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:47.600
stop disliking them, they're just like you and I

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:50.202
except they might be cooler actually
