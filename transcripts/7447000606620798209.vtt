00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.127
this is not a drill 

00:00:01.128 --> 00:00:02.646
the pool is finally full and 

00:00:02.647 --> 00:00:03.800
the sun is finally out

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:06.240
so I can finally show you how the old girl turned out

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:07.810
we spent six weeks restoring 

00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:08.868
a 50 year old pool 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:09.760
all by ourselves

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:11.760
with no pool renovation experience

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.960
and she's pretty big and was looking pretty feral

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:17.080
so I won't lie I was deeply concerned at times

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:18.920
there was so many steps leading up to this point

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:19.720
but in the last part

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:21.422
we had just finished painting and we were 

00:00:21.423 --> 00:00:22.720
finally ready to turn on the tap

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.000
which yes for those wondering

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.115
is a hell of a lot cheaper than getting 60,000 

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:27.240
litres of water delivered

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.920
I don't know exactly how much cheaper yet

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.520
but rest assured when I get that bill 

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:31.280
I will tell you 

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.560
and it took pretty much exactly two days to fill

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:34.673
but I was expecting three

00:00:34.674 --> 00:00:37.480
 and I was so fkn nervous to find out how it was gonna look

00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:39.158
final reminder of where we started

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.640
 and this is where we ended up

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:41.540
what do you think?

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:42.240
Bit of an improvement?

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.600
and can I just quietly say I'm actually so proud of this

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:46.480
we could have never undertaken this

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:48.360
when we first moved in 18 months ago

00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:50.243
this was definitely our biggest and most 

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:51.760
physically demanding project date

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:53.400
but it feels so nice and clean now

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.840
it's no longer covered in mould and infested with algae

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:57.960
it's no longer cracked with weird holes in the bottom

00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.195
and that was just phase 1 

00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:01.240
obviously it needs furniture styling landscaping

00:01:01.241 --> 00:01:02.480
and if you wanna see that unfold

00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:04.254
I'm so sorry but come back for the update
