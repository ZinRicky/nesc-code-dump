00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.560
After a long day waiting around at the airport

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:05.121
to not only go back home and hope for better luck the next day,

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:07.161
I was really tired and went home to take a nap.

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:07.761
Later that day

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:08.801
I started making dinner

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:11.121
with a few random ingredients I had in my home.

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:12.881
Got started making my lightly sweetened,

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.881
freshly milled eincorn zucchini bread butter,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.321
and then moved on to the main course,

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:19.001
a coconut pot pie style chicken without the pie crust.

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.361
Before we had left to the airport,

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:21.201
I put a container

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:23.721
freshly shredded pasture and primary chicken in the freezer,

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.521
so this was a fast food meal that was ready to go.

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:27.841
To make things interesting, I added some onion, carrots,

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:29.161
herbs I grew in my garden last year,

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.301
coconut milk, a little flour, and salt and pepper.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.080
While that simmered,

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:34.401
I squeezed the juice out of a freshly grated zucchini

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:36.641
and then let it sit to dry out a bit while we enjoyed dinner.

00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:38.441
The final batter came together in minutes

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:40.601
with the addition of two backyard eggs for my chickens,

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:41.601
vanilla coconut oil,

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:43.921
and chopped walnuts, which unfortunately I didn't have time to sprout,

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:45.201
something I normally like to do.

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:47.281
Neutralized by the acid and enzyme inhibitors,

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:49.761
this zucchini bread came out more perfect than I had hoped,

00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:52.441
with a crispy edge and that insanely undescribable

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:54.641
but completely doable zucchini bread taste.

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:56.774
Hoping our next flight goes out this bread is coming with.
