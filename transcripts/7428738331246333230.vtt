00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
this is a really good question

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.320
okay so

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:04.300
if the citizens of Kansas

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.460
enshrined abortion rights into their state constitution

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.980
then how come the attorney general of Kansas is currently one of the plaintiffs

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.640
suing the FDA to try to restrict mifepristone,

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:20.600
a common and safe abortion medication, for all American women

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.500
including women in Kansas

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.400
I say restrict there but more accurately

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:25.960
they're effectively trying to ban it

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:27.440
because some of the restrictions

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:30.480
for example that you would need three in person appointments

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:32.940
before your seventh week of pregnancy

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.560
like nobody would be able to do that

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.860
nobody is going to be able to access this drug anyways

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.280
in response to your question

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:41.680
the attorney general of Kansas would say well

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:43.600
you can still get abortions in Kansas

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:46.680
I'm not necessarily trying to restrict your access to abortion

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:49.640
I just have a duty to protect you from this harmful drug

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.900
that the FDA wrongfully approved

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.080
even though mifepristone is a very safe drug

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.120
it is safer than Tylenol it's safer than Viagra

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:58.600
and it is far safer than forest childbirth

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:00.640
it's kind of like when we had the Protection of Roe v

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:04.840
Wade and Republicans would always try to come up with unnecessary hurdles

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:07.800
to try to block women from accessing abortions

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.800
under the guise of saying that they're just protecting women and girls

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.818
with common safe restrictions
