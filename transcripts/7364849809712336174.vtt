00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.720
If you're in reconciliation with your partner

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:07.321
and they are still having such blow up arguments,

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:08.121
throwing shit,

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:10.761
you're feeling the need to run away, to go to hotel.

00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:12.921
There is no working on things.

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:14.741
He's not working on things.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.920
This is the behavior he needs to change.

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:20.361
And it is the behavior that he is still falling back to

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:23.601
whenever his little feelings get too worked up.

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:27.461
This is literally a toddler having a tantrum,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.720
you know what I'm saying?

00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:33.441
He is just manipulating and taking advantage of your kind heart,

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:35.841
your willingness to be a normal fucking human

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:39.261
while he's incapable of being a normal fucking human.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.320
Nobody has a right to start throwing things

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:45.121
and make you feel so fucking uncomfortable in your own home

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:46.241
that you have to go to hotel.

00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:47.561
And then he's gonna rub it in your face

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:48.681
and tell you you're a fucking coward

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.781
and haha, now you gotta pay for a fucking hotel.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.080
Like he will continue to do this as long as you allow it.

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:56.241
And I'm saying it with love.

00:00:56.242 --> 00:00:57.641
I love you deeply,

00:00:57.642 --> 00:00:58.881
I love you dearly.

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:00.861
I don't wanna see you going through this.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.560
And I just want you to be very clear.

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:05.701
It's gonna keep happening as long as you keep participating.
