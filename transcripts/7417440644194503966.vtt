00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.840
as a homeschool mom I had a ton of stuff

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:05.480
little manipulatives games

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:07.400
cards all of the things

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:10.320
and I needed a good place to store them that was easy to pull it out

00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:13.480
I could see what I had but it all had to be in the same place

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:16.840
and I found this photo box on the TikTok shop

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:19.880
that has 18 little boxes inside

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:24.400
that are the perfect size to hold all of my games

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:27.480
I have these little napkins I worked on last week

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:30.240
and they fit in here so nicely

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.560
I also have all of these like

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:37.260
math cards these are math facts for them to work on

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.300
and they also fit right in this container

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.380
it fits so well I can store everything in one place

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.160
and I can just pull them out so easy

00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:47.840
when I need an independent activity for my kids

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:49.160
so if you also are a homeschool mom

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:51.640
and you're looking for a way to store all the things

00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:53.460
you wanna get this photo storage box
