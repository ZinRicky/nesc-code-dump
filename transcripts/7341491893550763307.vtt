Today my toddlers wanted cereal for breakfast again,

00:02.960 --> 00:05.480
so I decided to make some Cinnamon Toast Crunch

00:05.480 --> 00:07.720
since that's my husband's favorite cereal

00:07.720 --> 00:09.500
and the kids have never had it.

00:09.560 --> 00:12.200
So I combine all of my dry ingredients into a bowl,

00:12.200 --> 00:13.480
give that really good mix,

00:13.480 --> 00:16.120
and then slowly add some oil and water.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.240
I incorporate everything with my spatula

00:18.240 --> 00:20.580
and then move on to using my hands.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.000
Then I add in the cinnamon

00:22.000 --> 00:23.520
and make sure it's incorporated

00:23.520 --> 00:26.820
before putting my dough on some Parchment paper.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.240
Use another sheet of Parchment paper on top

00:29.240 --> 00:31.820
and roll it out as thin as I can.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.200
Once it's rolled out,

00:33.200 --> 00:36.520
I'm using a pizza cutter to just cut it into squares

00:36.520 --> 00:37.480
or rectangles.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.780
You can do it in whatever shape you want.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.020
I ended up making two batches.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.840
Sprinkled it with some sweetener.

00:43.840 --> 00:44.680
You can use sugar.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.280
I use mong fruit sweetener.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.000
I put it on my Parchment paper

00:48.000 --> 00:51.440
and baked in the oven at 3:50 for about 10 minutes

00:51.440 --> 00:53.960
before I turned it down to 2:50

00:53.960 --> 00:56.020
and baked it for another 35.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.360
I pulled it out the oven,

00:57.360 --> 00:58.040
let it cool,

00:58.040 --> 00:59.680
and then broke the squares apart

00:59.680 --> 01:02.240
before adding them to bowls with some milk.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.157
This is now a favorite in our house.
