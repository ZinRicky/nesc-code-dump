00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.840
So I haven't really told anybody this,

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:03.201
but I have gotten. Well,

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:06.901
I've told one person. I have gotten really into jewelry making lately.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.960
It's become a new ADHD hyperfixation project,

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:12.441
and it's been really fun. I've made some really cute pieces.

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:14.021
I can post some if you want.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.640
I'm not, like,

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:15.921
selling them or anything. They're just for me,

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.101
because I'm a jewelry girl.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.000
But today, something really cool happened.

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.841
So I have this necklace I wear all the time,

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:23.321
and the not cool part is that it broke. Right?

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:24.961
And typically, you know,

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:26.361
I'm a bit of, like,

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:27.801
I'm a bit of a consumer. Like,

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.661
I probably would have just ordered a new one,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.120
because I have these new, fun,

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:33.401
crafty skills.

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:36.801
I know that it's just missing one of these jump ring things.

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:41.001
And I now have my little pliers and some jump rings.

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:42.201
They're not exactly the same,

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:43.481
but I'm gonna see if it can do the trick,

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:45.321
and it'll save me a whole another necklace.

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:47.921
So kind of sharing my little win here.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:49.281
So jump rings are just like that.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:50.281
They look like little rings.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:53.081
You just use two pliers to kind of open it up,

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:57.461
and then I'm gonna connect these two pieces. Now it's fixed.
