Two of my very best friends are about to start homeschooling this year,

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.121
and I am so, so excited.

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:06.001
So I'm going to pack them a little

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.241
welcome to homeschooling box with some of my favorite things.

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:10.281
First we're starting off with some of my favorite games.

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:11.961
Guess who and Banana Dreams Junior.

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:13.641
If you know you've seen any of my videos,

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:15.161
you know how much I use these every single day.

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:16.521
So those have got to go. Also,

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:17.361
guess you can play the game.

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:18.281
This is an animal edition.

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:21.521
But also, there are so many fun things that you can use this game for,

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:24.761
like putting in new facts and use it for math and reading,

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.101
so this is super versatile.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.500
Next I'm adding erasable pens,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.240
and then I'm adding in some of the printables

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:35.041
and things that I have made just for them to use.

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.341
Like that begins with anchor charts,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.440
this two digit with carrying over math game,

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.401
my ABC tracing letters, and these little.

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:46.821
I think these are just the CVC word puzzles.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.635
It is all done! I can't wait to give it to him!
