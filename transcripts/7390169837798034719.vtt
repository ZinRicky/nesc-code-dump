00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.240
when my flight is delayed

00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:02.300
I'm like

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.440
why aren't why aren't the papers covering this

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:11.200
if I'm in the middle of a mental be and someone literally like

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:13.020
a friend calls me and like

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.700
how's it going I'm like

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.120
you just assaulted me if I get a text

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:19.180
if I'm like not well and I get a text

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.700
and it's literally from the most supportive person in my life

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.840
I'm like how do I report this

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:24.760
because I just find it weird

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:28.340
that you can't delete your number from other people's phones

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.022
like it just momentarily it feels anti woman
