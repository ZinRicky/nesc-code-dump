00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.004
it pains me to admit that I'm still 

00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:03.080
renovating my kitchen

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:03.760
and I always say

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:05.499
you can't renovate without making a mess 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.560
literally everywhere else

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:09.760
so today I'm tackling some very dirty and very overdue job

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:10.760
starting with my fridge

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:13.290
so I'm going in with the JIF Cleanboost Cream Cleanser 

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:14.624
in the new scent Lily Flower 

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.280
the Cleanboost range is more demure

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:18.705
made with naturally derived cleaning ingredients

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:20.120
 and a biodegradable fragrance

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.200
onto the veggie bins and I'm dealing with what looks like

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:24.320
it would have been a great starter culture for my compost

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:26.240
I do love compost just not in my fridge

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:29.360
and this one looks like it was moments away from becoming sentient

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:30.560
if I thought the fridge was bad

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:31.960
the bins were so much worse

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:34.440
I used some more JIF to scrub the inside and the outside

00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:35.640
within an inch of its life

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:37.400
which did wonders for my mental health

00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:40.120
and even though it's designed to be safer for people and the planet

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:42.545
you still get that really powerful JIF clean 

00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:44.000
with no residue left behind

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:45.720
with the bins reset and smelling fresh

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.120
it was time to turn my attention back to my poor sink

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.640
which has just taken an absolute beating this entire time

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:51.680
I gave her a good scrub

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.260
while whispering my apologies for the 

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:54.800
trauma that I've just put her through

00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:57.160
and just like that the holy trinity of domestic bliss

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.108
aka the fridge bins and sink 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:00:59.646
are done
