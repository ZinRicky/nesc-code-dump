It's crazy to me that after almost five years of marriage,

00:03.201 --> 00:06.801
this is the first time I'm gonna see Lucky Walk a fashion show.

00:06.802 --> 00:09.341
Who better to do that with than Ralph Lauren?

00:09.520 --> 00:10.760
Were showing in the Hamptons,

00:10.761 --> 00:13.321
so we got up very early, got in the car,

00:13.322 --> 00:15.961
drove for about two hours before making it.

00:15.962 --> 00:19.361
First thing we obviously had to do was grab some lunch,

00:19.362 --> 00:23.081
and I'm so bummed out that tomato season is gonna be over soon.

00:23.082 --> 00:24.601
I didn't have time for dessert,

00:24.602 --> 00:27.181
since I had to rush back and start on glam.

00:27.280 --> 00:30.040
They were so nice to bring me my two scoops of ice cream.

00:30.041 --> 00:33.081
I needed. I always need something sweet to finish the meal.

00:33.082 --> 00:35.921
We went for something very elegant and simple today,

00:35.922 --> 00:38.581
and I was obsessed with how this look turned out.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.640
Before I left, I fed whimsy,

00:40.641 --> 00:44.141
took some content, and then it was time to head over to the location.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.920
It was set on this beautiful property

00:46.921 --> 00:49.381
with all these horses and stables.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.240
Right when I got there, I did some Ralph Lauren content,

00:52.241 --> 00:54.761
obviously also did one of my voice overs.

00:54.762 --> 00:57.281
And then it was time for the show to start.

00:57.282 --> 00:58.961
All the clothes were beautiful.

00:58.962 --> 01:02.401
I couldn't get enough of the fabrics and the fit of everything.

01:02.402 --> 01:05.441
I was obviously the most excited to see lucky walk,

01:05.442 --> 01:08.201
and when he came out, my heart started pounding.

01:08.202 --> 01:12.001
And then he winked at me, and I was trying so hard to Hold it together.

01:12.002 --> 01:14.801
I couldn't get enough of how beautiful all the clothes were.

01:14.802 --> 01:16.201
And when the kids came out,

01:16.202 --> 01:19.681
I tried not to cry. This show made me so emotional.

01:19.682 --> 01:22.741
It was probably one of the most beautiful shows I've been at.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.920
After the show, we did all the interviews,

01:24.921 --> 01:28.341
took some pictures and then sat down for an iconic dinner.

01:28.360 --> 01:31.640
I got the burger because I knew lucky would wanna share with me.

01:31.641 --> 01:33.581
And then it was time to head home.
