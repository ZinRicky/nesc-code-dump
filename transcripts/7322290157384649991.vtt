00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.260
camera shots of Taylor Swift

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.040
I swear this is where to go to here

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:09.041
a lot of people have accused Taylor Swift of overreacting

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:12.321
I wanna talk about why having a completely neutral reaction as a woman

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:16.961
to a sexist joke by a man is deemed as an overreaction by the patriarchy

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:17.721
I'm Doctor Zoe

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:20.801
I have a PhD in digital feminist activism

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:21.601
so let's talk about it

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:22.561
so for example

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:26.961
the term resting bitch face is pretty much reserved for women

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:31.541
I never really hear anyone refer to men as having a resting bitch

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.200
and that's because women are expected to appease and smile and passively accept

00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:40.421
and I guess give permission for men to be assholes

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.040
we are expected to kind of smile and get over it and make it all pleasant

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:46.141
and we spend a lot of our time and energy

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.180
um because we're socialised to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.240
um doing this

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:51.321
so when we begin to reject that

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:52.801
we actually have to work there sometimes

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:53.861
we have to work it

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.560
you know saying actually no

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.361
I don't wanna do that

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:57.001
and actually no

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:58.041
I don't have to smile for you

00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:03.441
and Taylor Swift didn't even react aggressively or pull any sort of bad face

00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:07.441
she just basically refused to smile at the joke

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:10.161
that wasn't actually really a joke at all

00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:10.681
and no wonder

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:13.521
I think she has a very valid reason for not finding it funny

00:01:13.522 --> 00:01:17.841
because American football has basically cheered her up and spat her up

00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:20.581
like they've used her milked her

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.360
taken advantage of her and the market that she brought in

00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.321
like the awareness that I've been able to achieve

00:01:27.322 --> 00:01:29.581
through association with her has been

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.680
you have absolutely capitalised on that until the team started doing badly

00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:39.601
and then she was used as a scapegoat to blame basically

00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:42.641
so she's probably very recently experienced what it feels like

00:01:42.642 --> 00:01:45.901
and what Posh Spice experienced um

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.280
years ago when Beckham with this

00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:49.361
this exact same thing happened

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:50.561
they blamed posh like oh

00:01:50.562 --> 00:01:51.321
she's you know

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:53.241
she's being a distraction to the game

00:01:53.242 --> 00:01:54.801
that's why Beckham isn't doing well

00:01:54.802 --> 00:02:00.341
she's probably very recently experienced this feeling of feeling like she's been

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.520
used and milk to throw it's worth

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.961
and then she's there to also blame when

00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:06.401
when the team doesn't do that well

00:02:06.402 --> 00:02:07.401
which I mean

00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:09.181
I know Taylor Swift is very powerful

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.620
but is she that powerful that she can control

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.340
the sports performance of a whole team of men

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.240
so then for them to make this joke

00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:21.081
I understand that it's a lazy joke

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:22.401
it's lazy writing

00:02:22.402 --> 00:02:23.781
and it's just not very funny

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.520
and I don't really think she has to have any sort of reaction to it

00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:28.161
and she didn't

00:02:28.162 --> 00:02:30.761
she just sipped her drink and refused to smile

00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:33.821
but when you refuse to smile as a woman

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.900
you're labelled as the aggressor

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.760
because being neutral as a woman is not being neutral

00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:42.041
it seems being aggressive

00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:48.621
cause we are expected and socialised to appease and make room for

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.920
and be okay with men

00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:51.561
and you know

00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:54.321
there was an implicit question in his joke which is

00:02:54.322 --> 00:02:55.941
are you gonna let me get away with this

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.460
and she was kinda like

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.100
no not really

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.680
I'm not like

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.321
we hold more power

00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:05.001
like you know

00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:06.321
Barbie Taylor Swift

00:03:06.322 --> 00:03:07.581
all of these amazing

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.220
you know like Ali Long

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.640
these are powerful women

00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:14.221
and those jokes are the jokes of men who are struggling

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.800
who are in crisis

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:17.681
because they don't know how to make jokes anymore

00:03:17.682 --> 00:03:20.341
because they don't know how to survive in a world

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.280
where their jokes are not funny anymore

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:24.401
like they were never funny

00:03:24.402 --> 00:03:27.261
but they're definitely not funny anymore
