00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.440
I'm a homeschool mom, and I wanna talk about this video.

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:04.641
I tried to stitch it, but it kept all the music on,

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:07.081
and it wouldn't let my voice over be heard.

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:08.281
I don't know. It was really weird.

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:10.521
So I'm gonna tag the original creator so you can see it.

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:11.961
But this was basically the whole video,

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:15.361
so pause to read. I wanted to talk about this because I feel like

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:16.561
within the homeschool community,

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:19.521
there is this innate criticism of public education,

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:21.361
especially depending on where you live.

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:23.761
One of the factors that caused us to be homeschool parents

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:27.621
is we don't live in a fantastic public education system area.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.440
Um, it's better than most in the state,

00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:34.181
but the state itself is pretty low down on the levels

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.080
as far as, like,

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:35.841
the states are concerned.

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:39.921
I think we are No. 42 in the country for public education systems.

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:42.561
They always talk about homeschooling as a humongous privilege.

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:44.681
It is a responsibility as well,

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:47.801
but it is a humongous privilege of time and resources

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.521
to be able to homeschool your kids.

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:50.881
There is no reason

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:54.281
that our country should ever get rid of a public education system,

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:58.021
not just for kids who cannot afford private or homeschool educations,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.500
but also because every citizen of this country

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.040
should be guaranteed an education by our government.

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:09.361
Now, we can have criticisms on how that's done,

00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:13.281
on policy, on administrative issues,

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.701
on what subjects and how the curriculum works.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.440
We We can have disagreements on that,

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:19.841
but you cannot have a basic disagreement with me

00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:22.481
to talk about the dissolution or. Yeah,

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.601
the dissolution of the public education system

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:25.881
and have me agree with you,

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:29.061
even as a homeschool mom. I have no intention

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.080
necessarily of homeschooling all the way through high school.

00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:34.281
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

00:01:34.282 --> 00:01:37.641
But public education is something that so many families rely on.

00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:40.961
Not just working parents, but kids in, um,

00:01:40.962 --> 00:01:43.961
aggressive households, kids who need a solid meal.

00:01:43.962 --> 00:01:46.721
I still don't know why we can't be supplying all the school supplies

00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:48.041
and lunches for kids

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.681
in our public school system.

00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:52.401
There is no reason that the United States. Oh,

00:01:52.402 --> 00:01:55.001
I also take issue with the fact that it is tax based

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.101
and therefore innately classist.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.080
The quality of education that you are gonna receive as a country.

00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:03.481
So in my opinion, it actually should be more socialized than it is now.

00:02:03.482 --> 00:02:05.161
However, um,

00:02:05.162 --> 00:02:07.561
homeschool parents need to get a little bit off their high horse

00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:10.021
because they think that they're doing something superior

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.700
and realize that what you may be doing

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.040
maybe superior to the public education system.

00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:15.721
However,

00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:19.041
that public education system is a life raft for a lot of families,

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:23.001
and it is also a fantastic option that we have in this country.

00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:25.841
We are going further and further away from our government

00:02:25.842 --> 00:02:27.481
providing anything of, like,

00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:29.781
substantial difference to our lives.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.500
Um, socialized healthcare,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.400
medical services. We.

00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:36.761
We are privatizing Everything.

00:02:36.762 --> 00:02:39.001
And if we privatize education,

00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:40.801
we are just. Oh,

00:02:40.802 --> 00:02:42.641
we are leaving so many people stranded

00:02:42.642 --> 00:02:45.161
because we've already done that with the healthcare system.

00:02:45.162 --> 00:02:47.721
I just think it's just a dangerous conversation to have.

00:02:47.722 --> 00:02:52.681
You can criticize something and still believe in its existence. Okay.

00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:55.981
You can criticize something and want it done better

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.340
and still support its existence.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.940
Okay. Thank you.
