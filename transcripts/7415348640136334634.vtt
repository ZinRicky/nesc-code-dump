00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
As soon as we landed in London,

00:01.801 --> 00:04.041
I started craving Indian food,

00:04.042 --> 00:06.921
and since London is one of the best places to get it,

00:06.922 --> 00:08.481
that's exactly what we did.

00:08.482 --> 00:11.481
We went to Jim Connor, and they gave us a private room,

00:11.482 --> 00:14.021
which I always appreciate at restaurants.

00:14.240 --> 00:17.040
We started with drinks. I always love a fun drink.

00:17.041 --> 00:19.001
I got a mango ginger ale,

00:19.002 --> 00:23.081
while lucky got some pomegranate mocktail with black salt.

00:23.082 --> 00:25.321
These were both so, so good.

00:25.322 --> 00:26.761
And right after they came out,

00:26.762 --> 00:28.401
our appetizers came out.

00:28.402 --> 00:31.161
Lucky didn't quite know how to work the pani puri,

00:31.162 --> 00:34.001
but these were probably one of my favorite things.

00:34.002 --> 00:37.441
Burst the shell and then stuff it with spiced potatoes

00:37.442 --> 00:40.761
and pour this green watery sauce on top and eat it.

00:40.762 --> 00:44.521
Absolutely stunning. The rest of our starters started coming out,

00:44.522 --> 00:46.081
which was some chicken tikka.

00:46.082 --> 00:48.721
I think the other dish was aloo gobi.

00:48.722 --> 00:50.721
Forgive me if I'm butchering all of these names,

00:50.722 --> 00:53.981
but both of these things were absolutely insane.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.400
Potatoes had some yogurt sauce on top with some tamarind,

00:57.401 --> 01:00.281
and the chicken was perfectly spiced and juicy.

01:00.282 --> 01:02.441
After finishing off all of our starters,

01:02.442 --> 01:05.521
we moved on to our mains. We did go a little overboard,

01:05.522 --> 01:08.601
but we just couldn't help but try a lot of different things.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.161
We got some garlic naan, lentil Dal,

01:11.162 --> 01:13.261
vindaloo, and some biryani.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.320
All of it was so insanely good.

01:15.321 --> 01:19.161
The meat was so tender. Vindaloo was with pork cheek,

01:19.162 --> 01:21.161
and the biryani had deer Meat in it.

01:21.162 --> 01:23.061
It was absolutely stunning.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.480
Finished off our main course with this non

01:25.481 --> 01:27.241
that was stuffed with some venison.

01:27.242 --> 01:31.041
I topped it with some pomegranate yogurt to tone down the spice.

01:31.042 --> 01:32.961
I started tapping out at this point,

01:32.962 --> 01:35.601
but lucky continued finishing all of our mains

01:35.602 --> 01:37.481
while I almost fell asleep.

01:37.482 --> 01:39.401
Lucky was done. He got the check,

01:39.402 --> 01:42.281
and then it was time for us to head back to our hotel.

01:42.282 --> 01:44.841
Since I wanted something sweet the night before,

01:44.842 --> 01:47.721
I had the most delicious vanilla ice cream at our hotel.

01:47.722 --> 01:50.521
So I ordered three scoops of that today again

01:50.522 --> 01:52.621
and headed straight to bed after.
