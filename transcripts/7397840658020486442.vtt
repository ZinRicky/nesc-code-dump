00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.440
Absolutely not.

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:04.521
Mothers are not taking on the shame of the state of the world.

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:06.441
We care. Thank you for saying that out loud.

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:07.981
Please go watch her original video.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.480
Anytime a mother posts an opinion

00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:12.241
or something she is choosing to do for her family,

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:13.921
there will be a myriad of comments

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:15.921
talking about how wrong it is for the planet,

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.221
society, and the environment.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.360
Potentially the kids themselves.

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.121
This commenter is talking about paper plates,

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:22.561
but you could apply this to literally every decision.

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:24.841
Feeding your kid organic using cloth diapers,

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:26.001
breast milk first formula.

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.361
As mothers, we hold the pressure of making the choices

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.961
that are best for our family.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.841
And to have people come into the comment section

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:33.801
and decide that we are what's wrong with the world

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:35.841
when women and mothers are literally horrible,

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:38.841
holding up the entire existence of not only our society,

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.281
but our economy. I also refuse to take that.

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:43.001
You know how many people have come into my comments

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:44.121
after I decided a homeschool

00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:45.721
and say that? That's really disappointing.

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:47.201
You're what's wrong with the system.

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:48.561
I'm not what's wrong with the system.

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:51.921
I'm reacting to the system as our every single parent.

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:54.441
We all make the choices that we can.

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:56.761
We already carry so much guilt over everything.

00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:59.170
I'm not carrying it for our world being fucked up too.
