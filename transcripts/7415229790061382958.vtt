00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
I think I'm gonna start a series called what's in my Homeschool Bag?

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:04.841
So I'm in our school room right now,

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:05.481
which I do love.

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:08.881
But the biggest fun of homeschooling is that we can be on the go.

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:10.761
So I always have this little bag packed.

00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:13.601
We've got Scissors, glue, pens,

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:14.841
pencils, crayons, etcetera,

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:17.121
anything they might need, and then whatever we're working on.

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:18.281
So today, what are we gonna work on?

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:21.321
Today we are starting a unit on who was Walt Disney.

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:23.521
The who was books are some of my favorite resources.

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:25.421
And my kids, for social studies,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.760
they picked Walt Disney cause we're going to Disney World soon

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.481
and they wanna know how the man,

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:31.521
the myth, the legend came to be.

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:33.541
We've also started a unit on neurology,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.800
brain structure and neurodiversity.

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:39.481
I am neurodiverse. My daughter is undiagnosed,

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:40.601
but definitely neurodiverse.

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:43.441
It starts off with showing you the structures of the brain

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.881
and the different parts of the brain.

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:47.881
And then it goes into things like anxiety,

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:49.581
depression, and neurodiversity.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.840
And then we're also gonna be doing our phonics work today

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:55.721
because we're still working on our workbooks from last year,

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.446
and I am determined to finish them.
