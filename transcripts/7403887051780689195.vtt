00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.160
I have been making bone broth for almost six years,

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:06.681
and historically, I've always cooked it from 24 to 48 hours.

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:09.521
Until last year. New research had come out

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:12.521
showing bone broth is higher in histamines than, say,

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:16.241
a meat stock. Undesirable effects like headaches can happen.

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:18.721
So does that mean that you shouldn't consume bone broth

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:21.001
and should just do a meat stock?

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.881
It's really hard to deny the benefits of bone broth.

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:26.921
Bone broth being higher in L glutamine,

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:28.121
which is an amino acid

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:31.801
that is absolutely necessary for the repair of a damaged gut lining.

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:34.921
Also much higher in things like collagen and gelatin.

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:37.581
Because of all the connective tissue.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.080
I always make sure to have a lot of meat on my bones.

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:43.481
Instead of switching over to a meat stock,

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:47.601
I am actually just simmering my bone broth for less time.

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:49.761
So instead of doing 24 to 48 hours,

00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:52.781
I'm doing about 8 to 12 hours.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.061
And that way the histamine content is much lower.
