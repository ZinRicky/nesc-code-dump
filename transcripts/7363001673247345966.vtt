00:00.080 --> 00:02.840
Here's everything I eat in a day two weeks postpartum.

00:02.841 --> 00:04.481
And as someone that loves to cook,

00:04.482 --> 00:07.201
today we're keeping the meals very simple and quick.

00:07.202 --> 00:09.721
Started off my day with a hot cup of fennel tea

00:09.722 --> 00:11.441
and some water with electrolytes.

00:11.442 --> 00:12.881
Still hate the taste of water,

00:12.882 --> 00:13.201
so

00:13.202 --> 00:16.661
I need to put something in there to make it taste a little bit better.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.400
Started making a blueberry sauce and made some gluten free pancakes.

00:20.401 --> 00:21.921
Once my blueberries had cooked down,

00:21.922 --> 00:22.761
I blend them up

00:22.762 --> 00:24.761
and then transfer it over to cool down

00:24.762 --> 00:27.301
while I make my pancakes and slice my fruit.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.600
When the pancakes are done,

00:28.601 --> 00:31.081
I top them with my blueberry sauce and my fruit.

00:31.082 --> 00:34.681
I also always take my postnatal vitamins with my breakfast,

00:34.682 --> 00:37.361
and this was perfect since I was craving something sweet.

00:37.362 --> 00:39.721
You guys know I always need to have my midday beverage.

00:39.722 --> 00:42.821
Today it was an iced robus tea with a splash of milk.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.240
The past few days, I've just been thinking about making kimchi stew,

00:46.241 --> 00:48.041
so that's exactly what I made today.

00:48.042 --> 00:49.241
I sliced up some onions,

00:49.242 --> 00:53.021
green onions, some enoki mushrooms, and some soft tofu.

00:53.040 --> 00:56.200
And I started by sauteing my onions with some garlic

00:56.201 --> 00:58.701
and then adding in my chopped up kimchi,

00:58.840 --> 01:00.960
my broth, and then all of my toppings.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.721
And I also had some wagyu in the fridge,

01:02.722 --> 01:04.801
so I popped that in there as well to cook.

01:04.802 --> 01:05.601
Once that was done,

01:05.602 --> 01:08.141
I served that alongside some white rice.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.360
This Meal hits the spot every time,

01:10.361 --> 01:11.921
and it's so comforting to me,

01:11.922 --> 01:13.441
but I always burn myself

01:13.442 --> 01:16.441
because I'm just too impatient to wait for it to cool down.

01:16.442 --> 01:18.081
I had a little snack before dinner.

01:18.082 --> 01:21.421
It was just some honey crisp apples with some oat butter.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.080
At this point,

01:22.081 --> 01:23.361
I was so tired,

01:23.362 --> 01:26.541
so I just used whatever was in the fridge to make a quick meal.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.400
I started by roasting some Japanese sweet potatoes

01:29.401 --> 01:31.441
and adding some fresh herbs to

01:31.442 --> 01:33.721
my garlic compound butter I made earlier,

01:33.722 --> 01:35.561
added some Parmesan cheese to that

01:35.562 --> 01:36.761
and top my salmon

01:36.762 --> 01:39.721
before putting all of this in the oven for about 20 minutes

01:39.722 --> 01:43.141
while I made some garlic chilli sauteed broccolini.

01:43.280 --> 01:45.680
Once my potatoes and salmon were done in the oven,

01:45.681 --> 01:47.721
I played at that with my broccoli,

01:47.722 --> 01:48.921
and this was so good.

01:48.922 --> 01:50.721
And I needed a little sweet treat

01:50.722 --> 01:53.338
and had some homemade cookies and cream ice cream.
