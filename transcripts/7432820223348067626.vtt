00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.400
Have you ever had an ex boyfriend that was incredibly insecure?

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:04.561
Or an ex girlfriend?

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:08.081
Somebody who need constant validation from you or compliments from you?

00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:09.941
Tell me I'm pretty, tell me I'm smart.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.280
What were you doing last Friday?

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:13.041
Why didn't you answer my phone call?

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:16.601
And they exhibited extreme signs of abandonment issues.

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:17.721
And it was something constant

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.761
that carried over into every single relationship.

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:22.361
Or worse. You are that person.

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:25.121
No shame in it. We all have our attachment disorders.

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:27.761
This is called ambivalent attachment disorder,

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:29.001
and it is one of the disorders

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.421
that Doctor Erica Commissar discusses in her book.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.800
Children can struggle with this attachment disorder as well,

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.321
way before their adult year.

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:37.361
And they are very clingy with their parents,

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:38.561
are scared for them to leave,

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:39.561
and when they do come back,

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:41.241
they're very difficult to calm down.

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:44.521
It is also known as ancient resistant attachment disorder.

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:47.861
If a mother leaves back to work too soon in her child's infancy,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.660
or is often on with her child,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.520
they're sometimes they're not sometimes,

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:55.221
and the caregiving is inconsistent.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.020
Just like all the other disorders we've already discussed.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.360
Ambivalent attachment disorder is that child's coping mechanism

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:03.801
to deal with how they felt.

00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:07.021
They weren't given consistent care when they were infants.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.040
As adults, they become super clingy.

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:13.081
They have deep seated insecurities that you can't even begin to touch.

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:15.261
Because the truth is, it started when they were babies.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.640
They need constant attention and validation.

00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.601
Maybe They wanna be Instagram famous.

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:21.641
Maybe they need you texting them all the time.

00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:22.921
That is this attachment disorder.

00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:24.921
And I guarantee you you have dated someone.

00:01:24.922 --> 00:01:27.561
Or maybe you are someone with that attachment disorder.

00:01:27.562 --> 00:01:29.941
