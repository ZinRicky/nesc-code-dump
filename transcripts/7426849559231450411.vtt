When my toddlers saw the crumble cookie box in the trash,

00:03.160 --> 00:04.640
immediately wanted a cookie.

00:04.641 --> 00:07.201
I caved and just decided to make them some.

00:07.202 --> 00:09.601
Rumble specifically requested a pink one,

00:09.602 --> 00:12.101
so I got right to work making the sprinkles.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.560
Started by combining powdered sugar and some vanilla,

00:15.561 --> 00:16.361
heating that up

00:16.362 --> 00:19.921
and then whipping that while gradually adding in more powdered sugar.

00:19.922 --> 00:21.801
I decided on yellow, pink,

00:21.802 --> 00:23.301
and purple for the sprinkles,

00:23.560 --> 00:24.960
and after they were all mixed

00:24.961 --> 00:27.781
I transferred them over to some piping bags,

00:27.800 --> 00:28.760
cut the tips off,

00:28.761 --> 00:32.961
and then pipe my mixture onto baking tray lined with Parchment paper.

00:32.962 --> 00:35.281
I repeated that process with every colour

00:35.282 --> 00:37.761
and let them dry for about two hours.

00:37.762 --> 00:41.441
In the meantime, I made some butter for my cookies and buttercream,

00:41.442 --> 00:43.781
whipped my heavy cream until it separated,

00:43.840 --> 00:46.600
squeezed out all the way, and stood under cold water,

00:46.601 --> 00:48.801
and then got started on making my cookies.

00:48.802 --> 00:50.161
Whipped together the butter,

00:50.162 --> 00:51.841
some egg, sugar, flour,

00:51.842 --> 00:53.421
baking powder, vanilla,

00:53.480 --> 00:55.640
let that go until it came together,

00:55.641 --> 00:58.761
rolled it into little balls before flattening those out.

00:58.762 --> 01:01.721
Repeated that process with all six of my cookies,

01:01.722 --> 01:03.361
and once they were all flattened out,

01:03.362 --> 01:05.441
I transferred them over to my oven,

01:05.442 --> 01:07.441
bake them for about 15 minutes.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.741
While those were cooling, I made a simple buttercream frosting.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.400
Since we're going for a pink cookie,

01:12.401 --> 01:16.641
we turned the icing pink, pipe the icing on the cool down cookies,

01:16.642 --> 01:19.941
spread it evenly, and repeated that with all of my cookies.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.280
This point, my sprinkles were all dried out,

01:22.281 --> 01:25.841
so I cut them up, sprinkled them on both of my cookies.

01:25.842 --> 01:28.748
My toddlers love these, and these were definitely a treat.
