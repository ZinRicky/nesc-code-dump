00:00.080 --> 00:02.620
Hi guys, and welcome to my channel.

00:02.640 --> 00:04.720
Today I wanted to talk about

00:04.720 --> 00:07.880
how to make the home amazing.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.240
Being a traditional wife

00:09.240 --> 00:11.680
is so much more than just cooking and cleaning

00:11.680 --> 00:13.340
and wearing house dresses.

00:13.360 --> 00:16.740
It is taking your house and making it a home.

00:16.960 --> 00:17.800
And not only that,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.080
but making your home

00:19.080 --> 00:22.120
the most enjoyable place you possibly can

00:22.120 --> 00:23.080
for yourself,

00:23.080 --> 00:24.340
for your family.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.900
That's part of being a traditional wife.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.800
We wives budget down hard.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.080
I think that is the most

00:31.080 --> 00:33.960
realistic part about being a traditional wife

00:33.960 --> 00:37.400
is that it's not all glamorous

00:37.400 --> 00:38.040
all the time.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.840
There is times where you don't get what you want,

00:40.840 --> 00:42.100
and that's okay.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.600
So instead of always spending all this crazy money

00:45.600 --> 00:46.400
at a coffee shop.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.000
I used to do that, by the way.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.260
I used to do that.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.000
We make our coffee at home

00:51.000 --> 00:52.240
for the most part.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.800
That doesn't mean we don't go out to a coffee shop,

00:54.800 --> 00:57.960
like, ever. My husband took me out for my birthday

00:57.960 --> 00:58.720
to the mountains.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.600
And you know what?

00:59.600 --> 01:01.320
I did get a coffee.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.840
And it was expensive

01:02.840 --> 01:04.040
because it was my birthday.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.160
We were celebrating.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.880
My husband wanted to treat me,

01:06.880 --> 01:08.420
but most of the time

01:08.840 --> 01:10.760
I make this bad girl at home.

01:10.760 --> 01:11.980
And that is okay.

01:12.080 --> 01:15.660
Another thing traditional wives love is aprons.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.880
Cause these aprons are like our house uniforms.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.680
We know when we put this aprons on,

01:20.680 --> 01:21.880
we Mean Business.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.400
We are gonna get to cooking.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.600
We are Gonna get to cleaning.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.480
We are going to scrub this house down.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.620
It's so we can wear our beautiful clothes in our home

01:29.880 --> 01:32.260
and still protect them with an apron.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.160
And you can have such lovely aprons.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.820
You can have a whole collection.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.280
And it just makes getting ready for the day

01:39.280 --> 01:41.120
and putting that thing on, like,

01:41.120 --> 01:41.920
so much fun.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.200
Traditional wives love dressing up for their husbands

01:45.200 --> 01:47.540
even though they are staying at home.

01:47.560 --> 01:48.780
And why is that?

01:48.960 --> 01:50.960
Because there's just so much to celebrate

01:50.960 --> 01:52.300
about being a wife.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.060
We are at home so much.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.120
Why would we only dress up just to leave the house

01:57.120 --> 01:59.260
when we are gonna be around other people?

01:59.280 --> 02:00.640
Why wouldn't we dress up

02:00.640 --> 02:03.240
to see the most important person of our life,

02:03.240 --> 02:04.460
which is our husband?

02:04.760 --> 02:07.100
Duh. So we enjoy our time

02:07.600 --> 02:08.320
getting ready

02:08.320 --> 02:10.000
and being really girly girls

02:10.000 --> 02:11.640
and putting on the cute dresses,

02:11.640 --> 02:12.600
doing our hair,

02:12.600 --> 02:13.900
doing our makeup.

02:14.000 --> 02:14.520
And of course,

02:14.520 --> 02:15.960
every woman's routine is different.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.660
I'm not saying that this is the same for every woman,

02:18.720 --> 02:20.300
but we celebrate

02:20.600 --> 02:21.840
being at home

02:21.840 --> 02:23.320
and we celebrate being wives.

02:23.320 --> 02:26.360
Big part of making the most at our home is

02:26.360 --> 02:29.320
really taking the things that we would probably do out,

02:29.320 --> 02:32.060
like getting our nails done constantly,

02:32.160 --> 02:33.160
getting facials

02:33.160 --> 02:34.080
and stuff like that.

02:34.080 --> 02:37.080
And we try and learn them at home.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.100
This is part of budgeting.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.800
It's saying yes to some things

02:40.800 --> 02:42.360
and saying no to others

02:42.360 --> 02:43.320
and learning to do them

02:43.320 --> 02:45.120
At home or yourself somehow?

02:45.120 --> 02:47.040
So for me personally,

02:47.040 --> 02:48.820
I do get my hair highlighted,

02:49.480 --> 02:52.800
but I try and do my nails at home.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.400
I don't have my nails done right now.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.520
I actually just took it off

02:55.520 --> 02:58.060
because I'm going to paint my nails after this video.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.480
But I have Learned to do that at home

03:01.480 --> 03:04.000
because it's something that I started doing recently

03:04.000 --> 03:05.020
that has just.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.080
It's made me feel so put together,

03:07.080 --> 03:09.360
just like looking down and seeing my nails done.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.160
But I don't wanna spend that kind of money

03:11.160 --> 03:12.320
every two to three weeks

03:12.320 --> 03:14.100
to get my nails professionally done

03:14.240 --> 03:16.260
when I can just learn it at home.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.360
So, you see, there's a give,

03:18.360 --> 03:19.200
there's a take,

03:19.200 --> 03:21.860
and that is a big part of being a traditional wife.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.000
And there's sacrifice with every life.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.920
So if you are a career woman,

03:25.920 --> 03:28.220
you are sacrificing time at home

03:28.400 --> 03:29.280
for your career.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.040
And same with traditional wives.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.820
We are sacrificing a career

03:32.920 --> 03:34.440
for more time at home.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.660
But that might mean we have less materialistic things

03:37.760 --> 03:41.640
and we are not able to go on fancy vacations as much.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.920
That is okay.

03:42.920 --> 03:43.980
For example,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.140
my husband and I had a humble honeymoon. Yes,

03:47.520 --> 03:48.280
you heard that right.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.120
Humble honeymoon.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.220
That means we did not go

03:51.440 --> 03:53.700
to a different country and spend

03:53.760 --> 03:56.620
thousands and thousands of dollars on our honeymoon.

03:56.680 --> 04:00.080
We actually got the gift to spend the week at, um,

04:00.080 --> 04:01.880
my. My husband's uncle's house

04:01.880 --> 04:03.060
in Myrtle Beach.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.860
And we Went there,

04:04.920 --> 04:06.880
and we spent money on excursions

04:06.880 --> 04:08.260
and delicious food.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.360
But that is considered a humble honeymoon.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.800
We drove, what,

04:11.800 --> 04:15.000
four hours away from our house? And, um,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
it was beautiful.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.440
It was budget friendly,

04:17.440 --> 04:18.960
but we had so much fun.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.740
Because it's not about

04:20.880 --> 04:23.100
the crazy honeymoon,

04:23.240 --> 04:24.520
the expensive stuff.

04:24.520 --> 04:25.660
It is about

04:25.800 --> 04:26.920
just getting married

04:26.920 --> 04:29.640
and celebrating the fact that you got married

04:29.640 --> 04:32.840
and a little trip for just you and your husband.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.800
And so, yeah,

04:33.800 --> 04:36.280
I am all for humble honeymoon.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.840
So, as you guys can see,

04:37.840 --> 04:38.920
being a traditional wife

04:38.920 --> 04:41.860
is making the most of your home situation,

04:42.080 --> 04:42.800
taking a home

04:42.800 --> 04:44.240
and making it a sanctuary

04:44.240 --> 04:46.500
for both you and your family.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.600
And I hope this inspires you guys

04:48.600 --> 04:50.120
to do something that you love

04:50.120 --> 04:51.340
outside of your home

04:51.440 --> 04:53.380
and take the time to learn it

04:53.400 --> 04:54.160
in your home,

04:54.160 --> 04:56.240
because it can make such a big difference

04:56.240 --> 04:58.580
and you learn a new skill. Bye.
