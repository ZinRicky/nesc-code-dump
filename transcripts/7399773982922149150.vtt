00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
The prettiness of their wife is the same thing as, like,

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.281
how big is their truck? How fast is their car?

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:07.841
How big is their dick? It's like a pissing contest between other men.

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:11.801
So you know how insecure men have those really big trucks,

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:13.161
and you're like, okay,

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:14.881
I know what you got that truck for.

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:17.061
I know what we're compensating for here, sir.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.760
The same thing applies in these traditional marriages for their wife.

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:23.681
Like, there is something super ugly and gross about the man,

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:25.881
and then they want the prettiest,

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:27.641
most trophies wife they can get.

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:30.441
Like Daniel Neilman in that article,

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:32.881
he talks about, the minute he saw her,

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:33.681
he was like, yes,

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:34.761
sign me up. She was, like,

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:37.241
the perfect height, the perfect blond hair,

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:39.881
the perfect whatever he had imagined in his head.

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:42.361
Like, you're not a person.

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:44.121
You are, like,

00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:47.701
a object that they're fitting into their little life.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.680
And so there is enormous, outrageous pressure to stay fit,

00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:55.141
to stay beautiful.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.960
I remember when we were having problems

00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.701
and we went to marital counseling,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.300
and we went to our pastor.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.200
He literally told me, like,

00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:07.961
one of my husband's issues was that I wasn't always dressed up.

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:08.641
I didn't, you know,

00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:10.641
sometimes he came home from work and I wasn't so pretty.

00:01:10.642 --> 00:01:11.961
And so, of course,

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:14.081
that's why he didn't want to do all the things I was asking him to do.

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:14.681
And I was like, well,

00:01:14.682 --> 00:01:15.601
it's hard to feel pretty.

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:17.561
When all I do is sit home with fucking kids all day,

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:20.361
I'm driving myself crazy. I'm a human being,

00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:22.441
not a fucking robot. You know,

00:01:22.442 --> 00:01:24.401
like, anybody with true counseling

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:26.721
would have been able to really guide us in some way,

00:01:26.722 --> 00:01:28.241
but this guy was like, well,

00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:31.481
you know, it doesn't hurt to throw on a little lipstick and look pretty

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:33.681
sometimes. You don't have to be dressed like a playboy bunny,

00:01:33.682 --> 00:01:34.121
but, you know,

00:01:34.122 --> 00:01:34.721
you could, like,

00:01:34.722 --> 00:01:37.701
use it up a bit. And I was like, okay,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.080
so it's not just from your husband,

00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:41.201
it's from, like,

00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:45.241
the institutions that you guys participate in.

00:01:45.242 --> 00:01:47.721
When you are in these traditional gender roles,

00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:51.001
it's like, it is its own community. And, like,

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.401
you could hear them have pissing contest.

00:01:53.402 --> 00:01:55.861
Like, I remember this one guy we went to church with,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.720
his wife was a tennis pro.

00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:58.401
So she was, like,

00:01:58.402 --> 00:01:59.561
she worked at a tennis club,

00:01:59.562 --> 00:02:01.841
and she was one of the professionals that helped teach it.

00:02:01.842 --> 00:02:02.361
So she was, like,

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:04.141
super in shape. And he always, like,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.360
about his wife, and, like,

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:08.761
I don't know, it was just.

00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:13.481
And then among the girls, there's just so much cattiness

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:16.401
because you're trying to make sure you're still the prettiest.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:17.721
And even though, like,

00:02:17.722 --> 00:02:22.001
it's just. It's literally the ugliest of the ugly, ugly,

00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:26.001
ugly, ugliest of humanity that comes out disguised as, oh,

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:27.121
but I just care about you.

00:02:27.122 --> 00:02:29.161
Like, you should work out while you're pregnant,

00:02:29.162 --> 00:02:30.661
because you Know,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.640
the baby, the baby.

00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:36.121
But there's no concern for the baby in other ways,

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:36.721
you know what I mean? Like,

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:38.441
it's not like a consistent cared.

00:02:38.442 --> 00:02:40.761
You only care when it comes to how I look,

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:44.021
but like, when my feet are swollen and they need to be massaged,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.680
oh, well,

00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:46.521
blah, blah, blah.

00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:48.661
Do you know what I mean? They only care about it

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.640
when it comes to how it's gonna affect how you look

00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:54.081
and how you dress. For me postpartum,

00:02:54.082 --> 00:02:57.901
I wore those fucking body wrap things that

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.360
our torture devices.

00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:02.761
I don't think anybody should be putting their body through that

00:03:02.762 --> 00:03:04.521
after fucking birth. But sure enough,

00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:07.821
I was like, literally eight hours after giving birth,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.560
strapping myself in one of those fucking things.

00:03:10.561 --> 00:03:12.881
Way too tight. And then by the fourth baby,

00:03:12.882 --> 00:03:15.281
I was like, this is my last opportunity to do anything.

00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:19.861
And I used the hip one to make my hips smaller as well,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.800
and it really did change my body.

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:24.641
And my hips feel funny. Uh,

00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:30.201
it's just the pressure to be perfect is outrageous.

00:03:30.202 --> 00:03:31.861
And that applies to everything,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.500
especially. Especially,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.700
especially your looks. I feel like that's why a lot of times they.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.320
These men don't always resort to physical violence,

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.561
because they're not gonna bruise up the merchandise,

00:03:43.562 --> 00:03:45.241
you know what I mean? They don't want a bruised banana.

00:03:45.242 --> 00:03:46.761
They want you to be pretty.

00:03:46.762 --> 00:03:49.881
They're just gonna hurt you in every other fucking way that they can.

00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:51.521
I mean, some of them resort to violence, too,

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:52.501
but I'm just saying,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.120
a lot of them are just make you feel like shit for who you are,

00:03:57.121 --> 00:04:00.221
even if you know. So, yeah,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.540
it's disgusting.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.540
10 out of 10, don't recommend.
