Let's make the crispiest German potato pancakes,

00:04.520 --> 00:06.480
also known as cutoffe puffa.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.720
I used to have these all the time growing up,

00:08.720 --> 00:10.080
especially in the winter time,

00:10.080 --> 00:12.700
and they're way better than any hash brown is.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.480
So I start off by grating some potatoes

00:15.480 --> 00:18.160
and make sure to squeeze out all the liquid,

00:18.160 --> 00:19.240
set that aside

00:19.240 --> 00:22.640
and put my potatoes in a bowl with some grated up onion,

00:22.640 --> 00:24.180
nutmeg, some eggs,

00:24.280 --> 00:25.640
and give that really good mix.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.880
Then I take my bowl with the potato water

00:27.880 --> 00:30.320
and make sure to drain all that water off

00:30.320 --> 00:31.920
and keep the starch at the bottom,

00:31.920 --> 00:36.040
which I add to my potatoes alongside some baking powder,

00:36.040 --> 00:38.060
just to make it a little bit more crispy.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.960
Then these need to be eaten with apple sauce,

00:40.960 --> 00:41.680
nothing else.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.960
So I started making my apple sauce

00:43.960 --> 00:45.920
by cutting up some honey crisp apples

00:45.920 --> 00:48.080
and adding them to my pot with some water

00:48.080 --> 00:50.160
and whatever sweetener you want.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.100
I use some maple syrup.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.440
Once they're really soft,

00:53.440 --> 00:54.360
I blend them up

00:54.360 --> 00:55.240
and there you go,

00:55.240 --> 00:56.540
you have your apple sauce.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.720
I formed the grated potatoes into little patties,

00:59.720 --> 01:00.560
fried them off,

01:00.560 --> 01:04.240
and then serve them alongside that warm apple sauce.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.300
And these were so, so good.
