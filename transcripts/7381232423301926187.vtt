00:00:00.361 --> 00:00:02.920
this grapist that I went to school with was at this bar that I went to yesterday

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:03.960
I was there for a birthday party

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:04.840
no one knew who he was

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:06.840
I was there with two other people who knew him from college

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:08.840
and obviously I did not want to party with this person

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:11.520
but absolutely no one would do anything about it

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:12.640
so I had to handle it myself

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:14.000
I went up to the bartenders and I was like

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.640
hey there's a grapist here

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:16.640
can you get rid of him

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:17.760
they're like oh sorry

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:18.560
can't do anything about it

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:19.760
like yeah

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:20.720
I was like but he's

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:21.360
he's a grapist

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:23.460
like he's a grapist in the bar

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.160
like the

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:25.160
the bar that I would go to

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.760
the bar that I'm a regular at would never let him be there

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.320
but I guess that's not the rule at every bar

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:31.120
I talked to this other bartender that was there

00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:32.400
he's like I can't do anything

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:33.280
I'm just trying to do my job

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:34.080
sorry okay

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:35.120
my bad I talked to like

00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:36.160
a bunch of guys around me

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.680
they're like it's your word against him

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:38.680
can't do anything about it

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:39.280
finally I was like

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:40.560
okay let me take it on into my own hand

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:41.400
he was flirting with this girl

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:42.540
I was like by the way

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.480
you're talking to a rapist

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:44.120
I look at him

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:44.800
he looks at me

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:45.480
he says nothing

00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:46.560
I walk away they don't budge

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:47.160
they don't move

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:48.680
I go back he's with his friends

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:49.640
I'm like by the way

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:50.560
do you know your friends

00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:52.880
a grapist the friend laughs awesome 

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:55.040
finally I said to his face

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:57.265
I was like why are you here leave 

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:57.920
after that

00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:58.840
he finally left

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.360
the fact that no one

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:03.038
no one in that bar was gonna do anything about it makes me insane
