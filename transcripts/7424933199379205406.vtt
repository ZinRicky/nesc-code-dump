00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.340
Let me show you all the shit I got from target last night.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.200
Favorite bag to go grocery shopping with.

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:13.361
And I know I look silly, but I can put all my heavy shit in there. Okay.

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:16.081
I overloaded my hair with protein.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:20.141
You know how it used to be like super curly and bouncy?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.120
It's like dead.

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:28.341
I didn't realize that the leave in conditioner I had had protein in it.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.520
And so now I need to like,

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:33.281
clarify my hair. I need to like,

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:35.641
try to get any excess protein off

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:36.921
and I need to deep condition it.

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:38.721
I also think my scalp is really dry,

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:41.381
so I had to get deep scalp hydration.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.780
But also head and shoulders.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.140
Hope it works. This shit,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.680
I used to use the Pacifica Pineapple Curls Curl Cream.

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:55.441
I just think it's too heavy of a product for my hair and my curl type.

00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:57.901
I have very, like a very fine hair.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.240
And since I'm getting a lot of gray,

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.081
it's also like the texture is changing.

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:02.721
So I think the curl cream is too much.

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:03.961
I think I just need mousse.

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:05.481
So I got their conditioner,

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:06.561
cause I just really like their shit.

00:01:06.562 --> 00:01:08.441
And it smells so good and it's really,

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:11.241
really good shit. You know that little spot in target

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:13.621
where you can get three little things?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.960
Oh, I got dry shampoo

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.601
cause one of my daughters has a very oily scalp.

00:01:17.602 --> 00:01:19.601
Like, you wash her hair and like the Next day,

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:20.781
it's like, grease bomb.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.180
I think her hair gets washed too often.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.620
I'm not sure, but we're gonna go dry shampoo.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.860
Oh, I got a setting spray because they're fucking, um.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.200
Primer is the stickiest shit on the planet.

00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:36.701
So I figure with the primer,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.280
makeup, and then the setting spray,

00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:39.801
hopefully my makeup will be good,

00:01:39.802 --> 00:01:44.221
because I was recently filmed on an episode of Middle Ground.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.000
Oh, I also got an eye eyelid primer,

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:51.101
because my eyelids are super fucking hooded.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.160
Like, you know,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.440
go away. They, like,

00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:56.921
fold a bunch. So if I try to do makeup,

00:01:56.922 --> 00:02:00.421
I get really hard creases. I got eyelid primer.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.020
My boyfriend bought toothpaste.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.920
Not for me. Somebody sent me a message the other day,

00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:09.321
and they were like, I like you,

00:02:09.322 --> 00:02:11.241
but I'm gonna stop following you because your shit,

00:02:11.242 --> 00:02:12.361
to me, is not accurate.

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:14.121
You're not like a single mom.

00:02:14.122 --> 00:02:14.841
You have help.

00:02:14.842 --> 00:02:17.221
You have somebody that's gonna wake up in the middle of the night

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.560
when one of your kids are sick

00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:22.041
and help you. You have somebody that was gonna split bills with you.

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:23.841
He's gonna help pay expenses for your kids.

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:26.561
And I was like, I appreciate the kindness, and, like,

00:02:26.562 --> 00:02:30.321
no hate to you, and you are completely mistaken.

00:02:30.322 --> 00:02:33.461
That month, we are roommates for all intents and purposes.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.760
Do you know what I mean? He's not a stepdad.

00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:37.701
He doesn't help me with motherfucking.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.240
He's a boyfriend. He does boyfriend. Shit.

00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:42.361
But, you know,

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:42.921
and it's shitty

00:02:42.922 --> 00:02:45.881
because when I lived with a woman and a woman was helping me,

00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:47.281
I mean, she was cooking dinner,

00:02:47.282 --> 00:02:49.841
serving my children and then tucking them into bed for me.

00:02:49.842 --> 00:02:53.141
She was cleaning up vomit after they puked.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.160
Nobody was like, oh,

00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:55.921
you're not a single mom. They were like, oh,

00:02:55.922 --> 00:02:58.861
two single moms, two single mom moms,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.920
you know what I mean? Or like,

00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:01.601
you're gonna tell me

00:03:01.602 --> 00:03:04.241
if somebody's grandma and grandpa help babysit the kids,

00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:05.401
now they're not a single mom

00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:07.321
just cause you have like an ounce of help,

00:03:07.322 --> 00:03:08.721
now you're no longer a single mom.

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:11.741
No, you're just looking for a way to tear women apart

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.840
based on an insecurity that you have.

00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:14.801
And I'm not here for that.

00:03:14.802 --> 00:03:16.841
So I don't know what the fuck it is,

00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:19.101
but it was cute and it was square

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.140
and it's a moisturizing gel cream, so.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.800
And it was in that little spot in target.

00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.101
So then I also got more shit for my hair,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.140
because since I have a lot of fucking gray,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.440
I got a purple shampoo, cause I read online,

00:03:31.441 --> 00:03:32.561
but I only wanted to get a little one.

00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:34.741
And I've heard this conditioner is really good.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.340
Camille Rose.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.640
I just wanna make sure it doesn't fucking have protein in it.

00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:42.281
But um, I've heard if you wash your gray hair with purple,

00:03:42.282 --> 00:03:46.561
it can like tone it down. Cause my gray is very silver,

00:03:46.562 --> 00:03:49.501
it's very sparkly. I wanna, like.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.460
Can we just.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.840
Just, like.

00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:54.341
I don't know.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.280
I don't know. I got another deep conditioner

00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:59.941
because that's something else you have to do after too much protein.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.840
My boyfriend bought this, not me.

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:03.221
We have different budgets.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.760
I bought this boy bio oil shit

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:06.961
because I realize I have a ton of melasma.

00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:08.561
That's why it looks like I have a mustache.

00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:10.961
I don't. That's just some damage.

00:04:10.962 --> 00:04:12.741
There's no hair.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.240
So I bought this. I don't know if it works,

00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:16.681
but it was in that target spot.

00:04:16.682 --> 00:04:19.161
This was. These were all in that. Okay, okay.

00:04:19.162 --> 00:04:21.461
Did buy enough. It was a buy three get one free.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.600
And I was like, damn it.

00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:24.481
I don't think I bought three.

00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:27.821
I think I bought. I think I.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.360
I think I bought three and didn't get a fourth for free.

00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:31.001
You know what, though?

00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:34.601
I did buy three and not a goddamn one of them was free.

00:04:34.602 --> 00:04:37.301
I was right. My. Okay. Okay.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.760
I am right. I'm pretty sure I threw my receipt away.

00:04:40.761 --> 00:04:42.021
Yeah, that's not my receipt.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.240
I got wrinkle off cause I'm gonna be in LA soon.

00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:47.181
Oh, and I got more of that tart.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.440
The Fucking Tarte tubing mascara and the fake awake are legit.

00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:54.121
I would have bought them from the TikTok shop,

00:04:54.122 --> 00:04:55.441
but I needed them, like,

00:04:55.442 --> 00:04:56.961
now cause I'm traveling soon.

00:04:56.962 --> 00:05:00.121
I didn't have time to wait for them to be shipped when I got this shit.

00:05:00.122 --> 00:05:01.561
I think I'm Probably gonna give it to my daughter, though.

00:05:01.562 --> 00:05:03.141
She really wanted it for her birthday.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.080
Actually, I'm probably.

00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:05.001
I don't know. She probably gets.

00:05:05.002 --> 00:05:07.821
I don't fucking know. Anyway, happy Saturday.
