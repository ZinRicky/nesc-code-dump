00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.200
The kids are officially home for the summer,

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:03.641
and since we're homeschooling next year,

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:06.641
that means they're gonna be home for every day after that, too!

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:09.361
And since it's been a while since I've done a basic makeup tutorial,

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:11.361
I decided today was a good day for it!

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:13.401
My new favorite foundation is that YSL.

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:14.641
It's absolutely incredible.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.900
I did contour and highlight with the Fenty Matchstick in amber

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.040
and born this way concealer in porcelain.

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:22.961
The NYX Fluff and fill is my go to eyebrow pencil,

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:24.081
and after setting all of it,

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:25.441
I go in with just a neutral

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.341
taupe color from the Too Faced natural palette.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.240
This has been my go to makeup look forever.

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:31.441
And if you see me in a video,

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:32.961
i'm usually wearing this look,

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:34.801
adding a little dark shade to the outer corner

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:37.161
and buffing that out so it's nice and smooth.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:38.081
And then for my liner,

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:42.001
I always use kat von d's tattoo liner and a drugstore favorite,

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:44.221
l'oreal's voluminous mascara.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.880
Little shimmer in the corner of the eye really makes a difference.

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.041
And then as my curls sit,

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:51.001
I use a Milani cheek stain and Charlotte Tilbury

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:54.241
amazing Amal on the lips. This look always makes me feel like me.

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.761
It is classic and easy because somehow

00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:59.261
my day always goes smoother when I'm ready for the day.
