I'm using this comment to piggyback and continue this conversation

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:06.840
because this is also why men leave women when women get sick

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.340
and I always think about Yolanda Hadid

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.520
if you don't know Yolanda Hadid was married to David Foster

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.720
she was a real housewife of Beverly Hills

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:16.000
and then she got or had been dealing with

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.160
but it got really bad chronic Lyme disease

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:19.440
and she started to be really

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.420
really ill for a long time

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.640
pretty much bedridden on a lot of medication

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:25.160
she had a nurse and like

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:26.760
really shortly after that

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:29.080
David Foster and Yolanda Hadid got divorced

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:30.280
and this isn't conjecture

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:32.000
this was actually said on the show

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.120
but that like

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:34.680
she forgave him because she's like

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.080
he didn't sign up to have a sick wife

00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:37.600
he didn't sign up to be a caretaker

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:38.600
yes you fucking did

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.680
when you got married and he couldn't handle it

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:43.360
so he left because there's a certain type of man

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:46.280
who is only in a long term relationship with a woman

00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:49.100
to be taken care of and catered to

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.640
and when someone within the family

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:53.020
whether it's the wife or a new child

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.760
needs more of that love care

00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:56.760
and attention at that certain time

00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:58.420
they can't take a backseat

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.400
they don't understand that a partnership

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:01.600
a relationship a family

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:05.240
is the push and pull of energy and effort and affection

00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:07.920
because if that man isn't gonna take care of his own child

00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.400
and jealous of the care and needs of their own child

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:13.220
just imagine if you got sick
