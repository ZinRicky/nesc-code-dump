00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.200
we have officially moved into our new house

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:03.280
and honestly

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:07.380
I didn't want to show any part of this until it was all put together

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.480
because so often we see these new home tours and everything is immaculate

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:15.980
and you just wonder how the heck does their new house look so put together

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.380
but this is our reality

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.320
we don't have furniture we moved into this house owning nothing

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:27.960
and we purchased just the essentials that we need to move in

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.960
so we've got bar stools as a dining table

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.660
we have beds and just what we need to function

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.220
until we can afford to furnish the entire house and do with it what we want

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.440
and I think that is more of the reality of most people

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:44.560
than moving in and having your house look

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:47.000
picture Pinterest perfect right away

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:48.860
so here it is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.800
here's our TV that doesn't have internet

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.660
no couches on to enjoy it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.102
this is us
