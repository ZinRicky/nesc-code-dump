00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Is anyone else going to bed tonight

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.400
knowing that you will not be able to sleep,

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:05.921
that you're gonna be glued to the television,

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:09.121
that you are going to be praying for people that you've never met

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:11.721
in Florida? I just, like,

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:12.601
we have family in Florida,

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:13.041
but, like,

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:16.161
not in Tampa. We have my in laws and Naples,

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:19.761
they evacuated. We have family in Orlando,

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:22.201
Florida, which people are going there to evacuate,

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:24.761
but it's still gonna be not great.

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.361
I'm just constantly scrolling TikTok.

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:29.041
I watch this mom with this incredible, like,

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:32.901
almost like Pinterest hack of how to prepare a kid's life vest.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.600
Like, this is not normal.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.121
But of course, she had everything she needed,

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:37.521
and she was so prepared with, like,

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:40.041
the glow sticks and the waterproof bag with all their information,

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:41.461
and all I'm thinking is like,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.840
oh, my god.

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:44.901
Like, this is the same eerie,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.200
unbelievable fear and feeling that I get when I watch people put, like,

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:53.161
bulletproof plates in their kids backpacks for school.

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:54.601
Like, this is not normal.

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:56.441
And I'm just so on edge watching it.

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:59.170
Like, this is right after Helene. I'm just so scared.
