00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.640
Home school mom outfit of the day.

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:03.201
I have two rules. Number one,

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.921
it has to be comfortable. Number two,

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:05.761
it's got to be versatile.

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:09.121
I've got to be able to do lessons with it and be on the go.

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:12.481
So here it is today. I've got a black tank that I've had forever,

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:16.721
gold necklace, and this Rev skort by Outdoor Nation.

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:18.761
It is bomb. Buttery soft.

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:22.921
I love that it is full coverage in the back and the front.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.181
It's got splits on both sides.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.880
Super cute pocket for my phone or keys.

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:33.121
And it's high wasted so it can tuck everything in,

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:34.661
keep you nice and supported.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.600
You can wear it for an outdoor adventure

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:39.741
or just hanging out doing lessons at home.
