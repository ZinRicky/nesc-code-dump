If you're new here,

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.641
you might be wondering what the contraption is on my countertop.

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:05.521
This is the spiral egg holder.

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:08.521
It beautifully displays the eggs we have here on our farm.

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:10.161
And it's also practical piece

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:12.901
as I have the eggs right there ready by the stove.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.120
So let's jump it right into why I absolutely love this egg holder

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:17.621
and I've had it for four years.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.880
Four years later and it's still perfect.

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.661
One of my favourite things about the spiral

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.880
is that it beautifully displays my eggs

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.001
while keeping them organised.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:28.001
So I always know which one is the oldest egg in the bunch.

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.521
Always make sure that I have the oldest egg first.

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:32.181
So this egg goes in first

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.820
and then I'm gonna always take the egg from the bottom

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.960
and that way I always have the oldest egg so I don't get mixed up.

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:41.381
