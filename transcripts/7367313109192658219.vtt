00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.840
You don't need to just choose one family to support

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.421
in Operation Olive Branch.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.200
This is what the, like,

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.361
Google Excel sheet looks like, right?

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:11.161
There's navigations to every little piece of Operation Olive Branch.

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:12.801
This is right now for, like,

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:15.541
mothers who just had children or are going to have children soon.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.020
This is where you would go to help those families.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.880
If you wanna help people who have disabilities or medical issues,

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:22.121
you would go to this page

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.321
and then it goes and explains their circumstances and, like,

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:26.161
you can see how much money is left,

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.001
like, necessary for their funding,

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:29.081
what the family is, like,

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:32.841
who they are. It's. All of this information is laid out for you, like,

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:36.321
you know, easily accessible on Operation Olive Branch.

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:37.561
This is for mutual aid.

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:39.361
This is for the first responders, right?

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:40.001
Health care workers,

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:41.941
doctors, like, Red Cross.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.520
Like, this is Red Crescent.

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.081
This is, like, if you wanna help them, right?

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:47.301
Like, each of these little areas

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.720
will give you an information on a new group of people that

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:50.641
if you want to help,

00:00:50.642 --> 00:00:51.841
you can. Right?

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:54.081
I feel like maybe some people

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:57.241
are feeling daunted by the idea of adopting a family, right?

00:00:57.242 --> 00:00:59.101
This. This might help you.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.600
Right here is a master list.

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:01.321
If you don't wanna choose,

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:02.281
if you don't wanna,

00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:03.401
you know, go at random,

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:07.641
you can. There are 800 and like 80 something families, not.

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:08.441
Not individuals,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.920
families that have been vetted.

00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:11.121
You can have all their Information,

00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:11.761
their socials.

00:01:11.762 --> 00:01:12.481
You have their ages,

00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:13.281
their stories.

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.321
You can have like their go fund me's,

00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:17.521
how much is left until they reach their goal.

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:19.161
It is all, all here,

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:19.961
right here.

00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:23.241
And I understand if you feel daunted by choosing just one group,

00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:24.281
if you don't wanna fill the whatever,

00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:25.081
whatever the reason,

00:01:25.082 --> 00:01:27.081
if for some reason you can only donate one time

00:01:27.082 --> 00:01:28.361
or you can only share one thing,

00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:31.201
like, just share it as a whole operation Olive Branch.

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:35.541
Like I, I think that this is a really great resource to be using.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.960
And you can see like I.

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:38.001
When I wanna donate,

00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:40.361
I just go and I look at like, who hasn't,

00:01:40.362 --> 00:01:42.121
you know, had a lot of movement,

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:43.561
who has like the least amount of donations.

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:46.121
I usually donate to those groups. Or if I feel like,

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:48.801
you know, maybe someone's about to reach their goal,

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:49.601
then you can donate there.

00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:51.061
Whatever you feel like doing,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.560
just you can go through and you can choose

00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:53.681
and you can read all the stories

00:01:53.682 --> 00:01:55.321
and these are all individual,

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:57.841
real life people and families that need help.

00:01:57.842 --> 00:01:58.521
And like,

00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:02.161
all of this work has been done till to make it so easily accessible.

00:02:02.162 --> 00:02:04.521
There's no reason to say that you cannot help

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:05.601
support people in Palestine

00:02:05.602 --> 00:02:07.201
because it does all the work for you.

00:02:07.202 --> 00:02:08.401
Like, these people have been vetted,

00:02:08.402 --> 00:02:09.201
you know their story,

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:11.041
you know, you know everything, right?

00:02:11.042 --> 00:02:12.121
This is what it is, right?

00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:13.441
It's all Right here.

00:02:13.442 --> 00:02:14.441
I understand, again,

00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:15.441
not knowing where to start.

00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:16.361
This is where you go.

00:02:16.362 --> 00:02:16.881
Go. Like,

00:02:16.882 --> 00:02:18.641
they did all the work for you.

00:02:18.642 --> 00:02:20.521
If you're waiting right now for,

00:02:20.522 --> 00:02:21.841
you know, to adopt a family,

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:22.721
you can still help.

00:02:22.722 --> 00:02:24.241
You can still share this page.

00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:25.401
I genuinely think, like,

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:26.641
all the information is right here.

00:02:26.642 --> 00:02:29.861
A lot of these families are trying to escape Palestine,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.400
but let's not forget that they should not be doing that.

00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:35.201
Like, these people are being ripped away from their homes.

00:02:35.202 --> 00:02:36.401
And, like, ultimately, yes,

00:02:36.402 --> 00:02:38.121
like, humanitarian aid is important,

00:02:38.122 --> 00:02:41.041
but what we need is a ceasefire and end to the occupation.

00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:42.501
And ultimately, we just need, like,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.700
Palestinians to be able to live on their own land.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.640
And it's unfortunate that the only choice they have right now

00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:51.401
is to flee, because despite the world seeing what is happening,

00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:53.241
United States has not stopped supporting Israel.

00:02:53.242 --> 00:02:55.381
Israel continues to harm Palestinians.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.880
And somehow we live in a timeline where people have to

00:02:57.881 --> 00:03:00.821
crowd source to escape a genocide.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.120
At this point,

00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:04.961
the only thing that's really in our control

00:03:04.962 --> 00:03:07.081
is helping these individuals get to safety,

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:08.501
get their families to safety,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.220
and support in what ways we can directly.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.440
And I'm glad that we're at a point

00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:14.301
where creators are speaking out about this.
