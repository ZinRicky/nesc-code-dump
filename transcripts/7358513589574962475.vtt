00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.560
I am so ready for a vacation in Hawara's new waffle fabric.

00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:09.001
It is extra flowy and really cool to the touch.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:13.281
I'm like, I just need that breeze blowing, flowing.

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:15.121
I love it. It's just.

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:16.821
It's everything Halar is known for,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.280
the amazing waffle fabric.

00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:20.301
It's flowy, it's stretchy,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.800
and it's at the.

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:23.041
The V neck cut

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:24.121
and the little short sleeves

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:26.541
really gives you that smaller appearance up top.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.280
And then the waistband and then the wide, flowy legs.

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:32.281
This is, like, so flattering on your body.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.821
I especially love if it.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.440
If you're going somewhere formal,

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:37.401
it really does look like it can be a gown

00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:38.561
depending on how you're standing.

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:39.641
I just. I love it.

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:42.641
It just feels so elegant and effortless at the same time.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.881
And there's pockets.

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:45.861
Big, deep pockets.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.840
I am 5 9, 165 pounds.

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:50.641
I usually do wear like a large.

00:00:50.642 --> 00:00:53.641
I size down and got a medium because it is so flowy.

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:55.401
I like it to fit a little more snug.

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:56.081
Any size you get,

00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:56.841
it's gonna be amazing.

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:58.241
And you don't even have to worry about the size

00:00:58.242 --> 00:00:59.241
because it's free shipping,

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:00.001
free returns,

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.881
and there's a huge discount for first time buyers at the TikTok shop.
