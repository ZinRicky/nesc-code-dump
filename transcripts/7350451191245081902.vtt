Welcome to Women's History Month,

00:01.441 --> 00:04.561
where if you are a woman who has had a not so amazing experience

00:04.562 --> 00:06.621
with a certain popular prescription drug,

00:06.640 --> 00:09.520
The Washington Post is here to tell you to be quiet about it.

00:09.521 --> 00:11.761
This is one of those all too common instances

00:11.762 --> 00:13.601
where we see a major media company

00:13.602 --> 00:16.621
pretending to be a champion for women,

00:16.640 --> 00:19.840
celebrating women's history with crossword puzzles

00:19.841 --> 00:21.601
and amplifying women's voices,

00:21.602 --> 00:23.641
talking about how important we are.

00:23.642 --> 00:26.161
The truth is that these kinds of companies and publications

00:26.162 --> 00:29.201
only care about celebrating and amplifying the voices

00:29.202 --> 00:30.381
of certain women.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.560
If you are a woman who steps out of line for a single second,

00:33.561 --> 00:36.481
if you even dare to share a personal experience

00:36.482 --> 00:39.681
that they find personally or politically inconvenient,

00:39.682 --> 00:40.801
they demand you shut up.

00:40.802 --> 00:42.081
So if you go and read the article,

00:42.082 --> 00:44.601
you'll find a couple instances of the Washington Post

00:44.602 --> 00:47.121
contacting different social media platforms

00:47.122 --> 00:48.501
and pressuring them

00:48.520 --> 00:53.080
into removing the videos of certain women sharing their experiences

00:53.081 --> 00:54.681
again with this prescription drug.

00:54.682 --> 00:56.721
The Washington Post could have done a lot with this article,

00:56.722 --> 00:57.361
especially during,

00:57.362 --> 00:58.161
you know, Women's Month.

00:58.162 --> 01:01.841
They could have asked more women about their personal experiences.

01:01.842 --> 01:04.601
They could have asked more doctors about their experiences.

01:04.602 --> 01:06.601
They could have compared studies,

01:06.602 --> 01:07.681
like, many studies.

01:07.682 --> 01:11.561
They could have dug really deep into the facts about this entire thing.

01:11.562 --> 01:12.201
But instead,

01:12.202 --> 01:17.041
they kind of decided to take the more easy, political way and,

01:17.042 --> 01:19.441
you know, just try and just Try and silence the conversation.

01:19.442 --> 01:21.041
So please, Washington Post,

01:21.042 --> 01:23.401
spare us with all the pro woman

01:23.402 --> 01:26.801
amplifying women's voices kind of cliches.

01:26.802 --> 01:28.921
Don't pretend to celebrate us on one hand

01:28.922 --> 01:31.223
while actively trying to silence us on the other.
