00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
This is not your grandma's Democrat Party.

00:02.281 --> 00:03.841
This is not your dad's Democratic Party.

00:03.842 --> 00:06.401
This is not even a Democratic Party of 2008

00:06.402 --> 00:07.961
when Barack Obama was campaigning.

00:07.962 --> 00:11.921
The Democratic Party of 2024 has become radically extreme.

00:11.922 --> 00:13.561
And here is just one example of how

00:13.562 --> 00:14.641
Kamala Harris is out here

00:14.642 --> 00:16.801
advocating for what she calls reproductive rights,

00:16.802 --> 00:20.361
even though the US is already one of the few countries in the world

00:20.362 --> 00:22.081
that allows abortion up until the point of birth.

00:22.082 --> 00:24.841
In fact, only a handful of other countries in the world,

00:24.842 --> 00:26.561
including China and North Korea,

00:26.562 --> 00:28.081
have similarly extreme laws.

00:28.082 --> 00:29.321
It wasn't always this way.

00:29.322 --> 00:29.961
Way, way,

00:29.962 --> 00:31.961
way back in the 90s, prominent Democrats

00:31.962 --> 00:34.961
like Bill Clinton advocated for abortion to be safe,

00:34.962 --> 00:36.561
legal, and rare.

00:36.562 --> 00:37.161
During that time,

00:37.162 --> 00:40.041
there was significant Democrat support for restrictions on abortion,

00:40.042 --> 00:41.461
such as parental notifications,

00:41.760 --> 00:45.200
waiting periods, and bans on late term and partial term abortions.

00:45.201 --> 00:48.561
Many democratic leaders, including then Senator Joe Biden,

00:48.562 --> 00:50.361
supported what is called the HIDE amendment,

00:50.362 --> 00:52.741
which restricts federal funding for abortion.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.980
Today, the party's stance has shifted dramatically.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.440
Prominent Democrats, especially Kamala Harris,

00:58.441 --> 01:01.001
do not support any restrictions at all.

01:01.002 --> 01:02.761
They have repeatedly voted against measures

01:02.762 --> 01:03.801
that would protect children

01:03.802 --> 01:05.241
after 20 weeks. At 20 weeks,

01:05.242 --> 01:06.761
these babies have hearts, brains,

01:06.762 --> 01:08.361
thickened skin, fingerprint,

01:08.362 --> 01:09.681
and even eyes that can see.

01:09.682 --> 01:10.601
In 2019,

01:10.602 --> 01:14.161
every Senate Democrat that was running for president voted against

01:14.162 --> 01:17.641
against the born alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,

01:17.642 --> 01:20.001
which would have required medical care for infants

01:20.002 --> 01:22.201
who were accidentally Born alive

01:22.202 --> 01:23.681
during a botched abortion.

01:23.682 --> 01:26.641
They voted against those babies receiving any kind of care.

01:26.642 --> 01:29.741
Polling shows that about 80% of pro choice voters

01:29.840 --> 01:31.640
support bans on late term abortions.

01:31.641 --> 01:34.401
Most Americans know how barbaric this practice is.

01:34.402 --> 01:37.041
Another thing that is even more heartbreaking and concerning

01:37.042 --> 01:39.161
is that no prominent Democrat today

01:39.162 --> 01:41.401
has ever taken the time to stop

01:41.402 --> 01:43.601
and talk about the pain management of babies

01:43.602 --> 01:45.221
who are aborted later in pregnancy.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.380
Sure, in California.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.160
Democrats there will advocate for bills that ban rodent glue traps

01:50.161 --> 01:51.881
because rodent glue traps are mean

01:51.882 --> 01:53.401
and cause too much pain to the rodent.

01:53.402 --> 01:57.481
But they refuse to even consider the pain of small human being.

01:57.482 --> 02:00.001
We need to ask ourselves how did we go from safe,

02:00.002 --> 02:01.161
legal, and rare

02:01.162 --> 02:05.021
to advocating for some of the most extreme abortion policies

02:05.120 --> 02:08.480
on the globe? Are these policies really reflective of American values

02:08.481 --> 02:12.521
or out of spite? Have we lost the balance of protecting a woman's right

02:12.522 --> 02:14.403
and also defending the sanctity of life?
