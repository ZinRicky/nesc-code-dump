00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.480
You know what I find especially funny about the man versus bear debate

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:08.181
is when women pick bear,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.600
all of a sudden all bears are a danger.

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:12.361
And when we're like,

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:13.541
but not all bears.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.380
Not all bears.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.480
Not every fucking bear is gonna eat me.

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:18.641
I've been in the woods.

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:20.121
Bears live in the fucking woods.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:24.461
I've been in the woods with bears before and not gotten mauled.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.560
Okay? But it's so funny that when we talk about men

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:32.921
and wanna talk about the men that assault us and hurt us and abuse us,

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:34.681
not all men, not all men.

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:36.101
Not all men,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.440
okay?

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:41.401
But let's keep that not all energy when it comes to the fucking bear.

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:42.321
Not all fucking bears.

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:44.301
Bear all fucking day.
