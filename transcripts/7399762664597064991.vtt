00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
I have six people in my house that share one bathroom,

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:06.121
and this is what happens to my bathroom.

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:07.561
It's just a cluttered mess,

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:09.881
and it drove me crazy.

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:14.961
So I got the five pack bathroom set from the TikTok shop.

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:17.161
I have it right here. Um,

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:19.681
I really like that I can organize everybody's stuff,

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:20.401
so I can put, like,

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:22.481
mine and the kids stuff in one spot,

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:23.681
our razors in another spot,

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:25.621
my boyfriend stuff up there.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.440
The little racks are metal,

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.061
and then they just stick with this little plastic

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.000
sticky sheet with hooks on it.

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.641
There's plenty of space for everything.

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:38.321
There's five of them, and they're super,

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:39.201
super duper easy to stick.

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:40.761
You just peel off the back,

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:42.161
clean the wall really good,

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:43.401
and then press it on.

00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:45.281
And then you have to make sure you get all the air bubbles out

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:46.281
and let it sit for, like,

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:48.681
24 hours. I really do think that's the trick,

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.401
because then the hooks are really, really,

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:53.701
really tight. So when you snap it on,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.680
the little baskets aren't gonna go anywhere.

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:56.841
They're not gonna be bouncing around

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:58.801
like the stupid ones that you have to put that, like,

00:00:58.802 --> 00:01:00.381
you know, kind of just balance in there.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.840
I love these things. They are amazing.

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:05.181
And now the bathroom feels more organized,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760
and I can wipe all the surfaces down

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:09.201
and feel like the bathroom is clean,

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.241
instead of just having, like,

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:11.641
puddles of water everywhere.

00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:14.621
So it's linked Right here in the TikTok shop if you wanna get some
