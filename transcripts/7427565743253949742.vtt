00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.160
you guys I am going to explain the horrific federal lawsuit

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:09.120
brought last week by the male attorney generals of Missouri

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:10.540
Kansas and Idaho

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.520
let's get into it first

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:13.800
you need to understand how we got here

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:15.480
so you may or may not know that last term

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:19.220
a Supreme Court heard a case brought by a group of anti choice doctors

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.240
who were trying to get mifepristone

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:23.460
a really common abortion medication

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.860
off the market for all women throughout the United States

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.160
the anti choice emergency room doctors said that they were personally harmed

00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:32.000
by mifepristone being on the market

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.880
because a woman could take mifepristone

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:36.400
and hypothetically have complications with it

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:37.680
come into the emergency room

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.240
and they would have to help her

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:41.000
and they would be personally harmed by that

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:42.400
because they would not want to help her

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:45.100
because they wouldn't want to be complicit in her abortion

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.480
as if emergency room doctors get to pick and choose who they treat

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.240
based on what LED them into the emergency room anyways

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.560
they purposely filed suit in the district of Amarillo

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:56.940
so that they could put the case in front of this anti choice judge

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.800
Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk here was like yeah

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:00.160
you guys are really onto something

00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:01.560
and he and his individual

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:06.320
infinite scientific medical wisdom decided that the FDA was wrong

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:09.400
and this actually and all of the other medical research on this drug

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:12.380
everybody's wrong and it's actually not safe for women

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.240
and he also relied on a law from the 1800s

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.220
that prohibited mailing abortifations through the mail

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.580
and he said that we should apply that to women trying to get mifepristone today

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.960
case went up to the 5th Circuit

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:25.400
who agreed with Judge Kacsmaryk

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:26.400
and then in a concurrence

00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:29.520
Judge Ho here was like I'm actually gonna take this a step further

00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:35.160
I believe that doctors suffer an aesthetic injury when they view ultrasounds

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.120
and develop an attachment to the fetus

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:38.920
and then a woman gets an abortion

00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:42.960
because the doctors really wanted to see this grow into a baby

00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:44.660
and they got really attached to it

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.460
I can't make this stuff up

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.120
then it made its way up to the Supreme Court

00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:51.400
and the Supreme Court was hesitant to take mifepristone off the market

00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:52.280
right before an election

00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:55.580
because they knew of the impact that would have on the election

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.080
they threw the case out on a procedural ground

00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:00.680
not on the merits they didn't really say anything about medication abortion

00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:03.680
they just said that it was the wrong plaintiff springing the lawsuit

00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:04.880
and they threw the lawsuit out

00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:06.280
we got a lot of headlines like this

00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:08.880
that made the public believe that the Supreme Court had done something

00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:10.720
that was in favor of medication abortion

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:12.160
when they really didn't do that at all

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:14.500
it had gotten thrown out on a procedural ground

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.080
if anything they basically wrote an opinion that was like

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:18.320
these are the wrong plaintiffs

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:20.760
and if you wanted to succeed in this lawsuit

00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:22.680
here's how you could do so

00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:24.660
which leads us to where we are now

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.000
so last week instead of a group of anti choice doctors bringing this lawsuit

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:29.920
these three attorney generals from Missouri

00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:32.800
Kansas and Idaho have basically refiled the suit

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:34.960
they say they are the right plaintiffs to bring this lawsuit

00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:40.420
because they have a duty to protect women and girls

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.980
by forcing us to carry unwanted pregnancies

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.400
even though they're in Missouri

00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:46.620
Kansas and Idaho

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.360
they filed it um

00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:50.320
in the city of Amarillo Texas

00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:52.140
so that they can be in this guy's court

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.080
they're also saying the FDA screwed up

00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:55.400
we're right they're wrong

00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:57.720
Mifepristone isn't safe and they're asking the court

00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:58.720
among other things

00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:03.200
to make mifepristone unavailable to anyone after *seven* weeks of pregnancy

00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:05.800
where most people don't even know that they're pregnant

00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.740
require three in person appointments

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.440
no longer allow anyone to receive it through telemedicine

00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:15.420
which is currently how one in five patients get it

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.560
because they have an enacted total abortion ban states

00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:21.200
so they know that some women in their states are still receiving medication

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.640
abortion through the mail

00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:24.560
and they wanna make sure that the women in their states

00:03:24.561 --> 00:03:26.840
who become pregnant all give birth

00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:28.900
they are basically trapped in the states

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.120
a lot of these anti choice states

00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:31.840
have also been trying to find ways

00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.640
to prohibit women from traveling out of state to get an abortion

00:03:34.641 --> 00:03:37.420
for the same reason they wanna trap women in these states

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.560
but don't forget that if they succeeded at this lawsuit

00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:41.160
it would affect women nationwide

00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:42.480
not just women in Missouri

00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:43.740
Idaho and Kansas

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.000
they wanted to leave it up to the states

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:50.360
remember let's also be clear that mifepristone is safer than Tylenol

00:03:50.361 --> 00:03:51.920
and it is safer than Viagra

00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:54.960
it is far safer than forcing women and girls

00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:58.140
literal children to continue pregnancies against their will

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.260
so their goal is to just boop boop

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.000
boop up to the Supreme Court

00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:04.120
who after the election

00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:09.660
may be more palatable to restricting access to abortion medication nationwide

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.600
and trust me they're gonna try to gaslight everybody

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:12.440
they're gonna say oh no

00:04:12.441 --> 00:04:14.240
we're not trying to take mifepristone off the market

00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:17.500
we're just putting in common sense restriction or language like that

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.200
3 in person appointments

00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:21.640
and you have to do it before you're seven weeks pregnant

00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:23.560
no one is going to be able to do that

00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:26.620
no one will be able to access mifepristone

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.200
there is so much more to say about this

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:29.200
the complaint was honestly

00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:32.400
one of the most disgusting things that I have ever read

00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:34.080
um but this is already four and a half minutes

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.200
so we're gonna take a pause here

00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:38.220
let me know what questions you have in the comments and if you wanna learn more

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.760
and I'm the feminist lawyer

00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:41.660
follow me if you enjoy being miserable
