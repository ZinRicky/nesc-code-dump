00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.480
men don't actually understand that if you have these three qualities about you

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:07.241
you can lock down any high value woman you want

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:12.321
you see drop dead gorgeous smoke show women sometimes with average looking men

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:16.561
and then you're probably asking yourself what does he have that I don't have

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:20.441
and then you probably said on the idea that oh it must be because he's rich

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:22.521
oh that's not necessarily the case

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.021
maybe it can be in some

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.300
but I'm not saying it's always the case

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.100
Wanna know what the most attractive qualities a man can have is

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.720
no you don't have to be the most attractive guy physically

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.001
you don't have to be the biggest guy in the room

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.361
and you don't have to be an alpha

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:39.881
instead if you wanna high value woman

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:43.381
you need to possess a perfect balance of confidence

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.760
peace and safety

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:48.661
that's what these high value women are looking for in a man

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.400
number one confidence

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:52.181
you're able to get things done

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.040
especially when problems arise

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.361
number two peace

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:58.701
meaning you're able to create a peaceful environment for

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.040
where she never doubts that she's being heard or seen

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.781
it's all women want is to be understood and loved

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.120
she knows that her heart is safe with you

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.901
because you've created a peaceful environment for her

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.300
three lastly

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.260
you're protective over her

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.120
not only does she know that you protect her heart

00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:19.301
but you also protect her safety

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.100
situations where her safety is at risk

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.120
you step up and protect her

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:27.821
so next time you see an average looking guy with a gorgeous girl

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.600
you can probably assume that it's not because he has money

00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:32.401
instead

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:37.181
it's because he has these three qualities that every woman looks for in a man

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.120
and this could be you

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.141
you could be a high value man with these three qualities

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.096
and get a high value woman
