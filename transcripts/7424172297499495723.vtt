00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.120
I just got in a PR box from Merit Beauty

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:05.420
so let's do a transitional fall look using merit products

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.320
okay first of all

00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:08.160
this is the first PR box I've gotten that came

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.080
look at this little like

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.840
corduroy satchel oh

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.080
so excited okay

00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:15.520
what was in the box we have the three blush combo

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:18.380
this is the mini Flush Bomb trio

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.520
I already have one of these balms and I absolutely love the formula

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.120
so I'm really excited to try these out

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:24.840
and this is called their dress code set

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:29.080
this is three fall shades of lip color for the season

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:31.540
so I'm gonna do my base and then we're gonna check these out

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.840
now these are the colors that you get in this set

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:38.780
this is mood which is like this almost like Berry colour

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.260
beautiful

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.000
Stockholm which has a little bit of orange to it

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.540
it's like this nice dusty rose

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.840
and then this is bespoke it looks brown in the container

00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:53.900
but I'm excited to see what it'll look like on the skin

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.720
I think I'm gonna go with the mood flush bomb today just to see

00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:01.300
because I've never really used a Berry coloured

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.880
ooh

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.240
okay now you can see these are super pigmented

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:09.820
so let's blend them out and I'm just gonna use my finger honestly

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.000
cause they blend so nicely

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.820
that's what I really like about the other color I have

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.780
is these just melt into the skin

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.740
just gonna set with a little bit of powder

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.960
so pretty I love that

00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:23.840
now I also have three lip colors to choose from

00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:27.520
this is black tie bespoke

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:30.900
and dijour I'm gonna take them out so you can see the colors

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.180
black tie

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.700
bespoke

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.880
ooh dijour

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.640
this is like a really pretty mauve

00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:40.060
I think I'm gonna try this one

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.980
already super creamy

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.160
and this is a matte color

00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:48.060
so I'm shocked that it's this creamy

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.200
holy cow okay

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:52.440
so this is the creamiest matte color

00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:54.000
it almost has this like

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.620
powdery effect but this is such a subtle shade

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.560
I'm kind of obsessed with this

00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:00.560
wow okay

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:01.880
I actually wanna try the other ones

00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:04.980
cause now I'm I'm intrigued this is black tie

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.400
oh yeah okay

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:11.640
I'm a sucker for a red lip

00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:14.900
and this is so subtle it's almost that like

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.320
burgundy just kissed after drinking red wine look

00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.620
it is fabulous and this is the last one this is bespoke

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.700
oh this one's luminous

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.560
so that felt like Chapstick going on

00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:35.040
so it feels almost like I'm not wearing anything

00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:36.520
but the color is this like

00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:39.760
beautiful coffee red it's like

00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:41.320
it's got brown undertones

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:43.700
it's very luminous you can see the shine

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.920
um and really lightweight

00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:47.600
ooh this is a really good everyday

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:49.500
like lip for the fall

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.260
but I'm gonna go with black tie today

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.360
