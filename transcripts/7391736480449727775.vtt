00:00.000 --> 00:06.300
Tuesday morning was a very exciting morning over at our house.

00:06.800 --> 00:10.560
Tuesday was the day that our dairy cows got delivered.

00:10.561 --> 00:13.241
So we all got dressed, hopped in the can am

00:13.242 --> 00:19.661
and made over the dairy just in time for the cow truck to arrive.

00:19.880 --> 00:24.340
So we had. I invited the bars over to documents.

00:24.760 --> 00:30.780
We had neighbors over. We had Aiden and Glenn and Corrine and Stockton.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.980
All hands on deck.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.380
I walked into the barn right before the cows came in and just like

00:37.680 --> 00:39.800
got super emotional. I mean,

00:39.801 --> 00:42.461
this project has been.

00:42.520 --> 00:46.900
We've been dreaming about this since the beginning of our marriage.

00:47.320 --> 00:51.560
And um, the barn has been under construction for about two years.

00:51.561 --> 00:57.321
And so to see it all ready to go and ready for cows was just like

00:57.322 --> 01:02.181
such an amazing feeling. So the cow trailer,

01:02.760 --> 01:07.200
it backed up, it got into the loading unloading dock.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.021
I guess you could say that we put up

01:09.080 --> 01:12.320
and then we just watch them unload all the cows.

01:12.321 --> 01:18.521
So we have a mixture of Jersey cows and Jersey Holstein cross.

01:18.522 --> 01:21.021
So that's why you'll see some variation in the cows.

01:21.560 --> 01:24.620
But like, we watched every single cow get off the.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.960
The truck. This is a double decker truck.

01:26.961 --> 01:30.001
And so after the, the bottom, um,

01:30.002 --> 01:32.081
tier was empty, they opened up the,

01:32.082 --> 01:34.961
the top tier and we watched the cows come down from there,

01:34.962 --> 01:36.141
which is really cool.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.960
We had all the. The boys had friends over,

01:40.961 --> 01:44.241
And neighbors were coming over to see.

01:44.242 --> 01:47.141
This is like, such an exciting day over at the farm.

01:47.720 --> 01:51.400
Um, a lot of anticipation for this event.

01:51.401 --> 01:54.121
These are the robot installers.

01:54.122 --> 01:56.881
So these guys have been working on the barn since day one

01:56.882 --> 02:00.921
with us as well. This is an all robotic dairy,

02:00.922 --> 02:02.621
A Lele robotic dairy.

02:03.800 --> 02:10.380
The Lele robot is made in Holland. That was made honey

02:12.040 --> 02:13.060
designed in Holland.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.600
Make them in America now as well.

02:15.601 --> 02:17.301
But, um,

02:17.840 --> 02:20.200
yeah, it's been a really cool process

02:20.201 --> 02:25.161
to get all the aspects of this barn ready to go for cows.

02:25.162 --> 02:29.181
And just seeing them walk in for the first time was so exciting.

02:30.040 --> 02:34.460
Everyone just kinda watch the cows for the first couple hours,

02:34.720 --> 02:35.820
get situated.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.400
Um,

02:38.680 --> 02:43.080
Martha was trying to pet them from the get go.

02:43.081 --> 02:44.721
She was like, she's gonna win them over.

02:44.722 --> 02:47.801
That's her goal. So we started right off the bat

02:47.802 --> 02:50.561
getting their robotic collars on.

02:50.562 --> 02:52.681
So this is what Stockton's doing over here.

02:52.682 --> 02:55.801
He's putting their collars on so they can go into the robot.

02:55.802 --> 02:57.841
So this is Glenn, um,

02:57.842 --> 03:00.321
with the first cow. She'd walked into the robot.

03:00.322 --> 03:02.241
And we're kind of on the backside of the robot,

03:02.242 --> 03:03.421
is what we call it.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.040
And this robot goes underneath the udder,

03:07.041 --> 03:08.961
washes it, and milks her out.

03:08.962 --> 03:10.361
And then it shows us, you know,

03:10.362 --> 03:14.041
how much eat teeth each teeth is giving, um,

03:14.042 --> 03:17.081
how much she's weighing, how much she typically gives.

03:17.082 --> 03:20.381
It takes her Temperature. Um,

03:20.760 --> 03:22.720
it's really like an incredible machine.

03:22.721 --> 03:26.201
I'm excited to show you more as we get going on these robots.

03:26.202 --> 03:28.161
But it is a learning curve for the cows

03:28.162 --> 03:31.801
because they're not used to robotic system.

03:31.802 --> 03:35.401
So that's what we're going to be doing for the next two weeks,

03:35.402 --> 03:37.701
is training these cows to the robot.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.120
Of course, for Joe,

03:40.121 --> 03:42.221
with all this milk talk, was.

03:42.880 --> 03:48.500
Was hungry. We spent the whole day at the dairy just watching cows,

03:48.520 --> 03:51.780
learning cows, getting them milked in the robot,

03:52.920 --> 03:55.040
and, um, yeah,

03:55.041 --> 03:57.841
learning about. Learning about each one of them.

03:57.842 --> 03:59.761
The kids named every single one of them,

03:59.762 --> 04:02.421
so that was. That was a big job.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.560
We're definitely gonna have to rename a lot of them, because, um,

04:06.561 --> 04:10.441
I think most of the kids were hungry when they did the naming process.

04:10.442 --> 04:12.801
So a lot of them are, uh,

04:12.802 --> 04:15.521
food items. So I'll probably have to rename some of the cows.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.761
But it was just, uh,

04:17.762 --> 04:21.421
so fun to just spend the day in the dairy, learning,

04:21.440 --> 04:23.020
seeing, um.

04:23.600 --> 04:28.240
Yeah, watching the barn come to life is actually quite an emotional day,

04:28.241 --> 04:29.041
too, for Daniel.

04:29.042 --> 04:29.801
And I, like,

04:29.802 --> 04:31.981
I'd catch him in the corner just,

04:32.360 --> 04:33.480
you know, tearing up.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.661
He's like, can't believe this is happening.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.480
You know, a lot of,

04:37.481 --> 04:39.541
a lot of hard work to get to this point.

04:39.560 --> 04:45.460
Here is Mabel. She was Karen's right hand girl in getting all the cows.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.760
Their collars on and numbered for Lunch,

04:49.761 --> 04:52.241
we had. We came home and had milk.

04:52.242 --> 04:54.861
Cause that's what we. That's what we're gonna eat now.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.660
Three meals a day, you know, that's what we got.
