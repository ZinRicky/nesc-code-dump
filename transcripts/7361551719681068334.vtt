00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.840
me and a friend of mine were recently talking about loneliness

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.400
especially how it affects mothers

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:06.960
so allow me to ramble for just like a hot second

00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:10.840
because one of the most profound feelings in motherhood that I experienced

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:14.420
especially when I had 202 and was like a full time stay at home mom

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.640
was loneliness

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:19.360
and the isolation that comes just naturally with being a stay at home mom

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:22.200
now a lot of the times in the media right now we're hearing about this like

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.840
male loneliness epidemic

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:25.360
but can we talk about for a second

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:28.720
why it is so jarring for women in motherhood to experience this

00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:33.780
and that is because there is nothing more in community than women in their youth

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.960
women and their friend groups are these dynamic

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.060
little communities within themselves

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.920
and there's nothing that takes away that sense of community than having a child

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:48.020
whether you're the first or the last or the one who decides not to have kids

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.360
one of your friends having kids drastically changes the friend group

00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.840
and I don't know about y'all

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:55.240
but like most of my best friends I made in college

00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:59.460
so we all went off to our own corners of the universe after that

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.580
and I was the first to have kids

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.960
so when we talk about loneliness for mothers

00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:07.480
when we talk about loneliness for being stay at home moms especially

00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:11.000
it's not just that we're alone and we're experiencing loneliness

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.160
it is that we're experiencing loneliness

00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:19.020
after already experiencing this great sense of friendship and community

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.280
being alone in your house all day is not the way mothers were supposed to mother

00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:27.640
we were supposed to have this continuation of these female relationships

00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:30.340
that's what we talk about when we're talking about a village

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.280
we're not talking about the dad participating

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:36.680
although that is 100% expected and necessary

00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:40.020
but we're talking about these female groups of companionship

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.780
women have always thrived in community of women in the company of women

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.000
and we were not supposed to go from girlhood and friendships and community

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.200
into our womanhood

00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:53.500
and then isolated in motherhood

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.380
there is a reason to feel so lonely and it's because it's unnatural

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.940
and that was a product of the nuclear family and the Industrial Revolution

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.620
and white supremacy

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.360
if we wanna go that deep

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:06.660
if you're ready for that
