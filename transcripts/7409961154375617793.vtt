00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.240
last week my dishwasher ate a wine glass

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:03.892
and it's much easier to place blame

00:00:03.893 --> 00:00:05.120
 on the dishwasher and not

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:06.360
you know, user error

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:07.996
but I'm one of these people who can't go to 

00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:09.000
bed with dishes in the sink

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.560
so after a date night with hubby

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.360
I just jammed it into an already overly full dishwasher

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:15.040
but I'm paranoid it's gonna happen again

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:16.800
so I switched to the new Chux DishWand

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.760
which is economically designed to fit inside  narrow glassware

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:21.960
you just fill it up with your favourite dishwashing liquid

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:23.540
and close the anti-leak lid

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.400
get it wet and give it a couple of presses

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:26.600
 until suds start to come out

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:28.920
my favourite technique is the old swoosh & spin

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:31.400
so I just rotate the wine glass while I work my way around

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:32.800
with the non-scratch sponge

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.240
I like it cause it's quick and easy

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:36.040
it can reach right to the bottom of the wine glass

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:37.600
and I don't need to fill up the whole sink

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:39.560
once it's clean I rinse it out with fresh water

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:40.304
give it a dry 

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:42.430
and I'm left with two sparkling glasses 

00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:43.440
which aren't broken, might i add

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:46.220
 and with that done I can actually sleep peacefully
