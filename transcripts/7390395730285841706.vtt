00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.820
Get ready with me for our baby's gender reveal.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.040
I am 10 weeks pregnant with our first child,

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:08.041
and we are so excited to find out who this little one is.

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:09.841
We decided to do the early blood test

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.541
instead of waiting for an ultrasound.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.360
This first trimester has had me for a loop.

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:18.321
I have been so nauseous and stuck on the couch for the past two months,

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:19.921
hence why my hair is so greasy.

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:21.041
It hasn't been washed in a week,

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:23.121
and it is so gross. I know,

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:24.841
but I have a heart condition called POTS,

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:28.501
and that plus the nausea makes showering such a chore.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.240
It's, like the only activity I can do all day.

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:33.161
So we are working with the greasy hair

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:36.201
and hiding it with braids in a scarf for the gender reveal.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.761
I did the blood test last week,

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:39.941
and the lab sent the results to my mom.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.000
She mailed us a couple of color blasters,

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.281
and that is how we are going to find out.

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:46.641
My whole family is watching over video chat

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:47.681
because they're long distance,

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:50.821
and I'm just so happy they get to be included despite the distance.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.340
This is the first grandbaby and great grandbaby in my family,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.020
and I just know our little one is gonna be so loved.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.080
Come back tomorrow to find out if we're having a boy or a girl,

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:04.221
and let me know in the comments what you think.
