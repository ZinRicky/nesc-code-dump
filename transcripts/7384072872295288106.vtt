00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Why are people asking for directions

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:04.880
Do you not have a phone, GPS, Google Maps

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:05.840
I don't understand

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:08.320
why is anybody asking for directions

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:09.000
not only that

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.920
if we're going out to dinner and you suggest a restaurant, location

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:15.520
a place and you tell me it's North, East

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:16.520
south or west

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:17.360
Don't do that

00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:17.689
Don't 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.600
that's not gonna help me figure out where we're going

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:21.520
what state we are in

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:22.720
what country we're in

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.640
just stop, don't do it

00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:28.200
I got GPS I can figure it out on my own

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:31.600
and I guarantee giving me a compass won't help me get there

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.920
We need to stop normalizing giving directions

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:39.840
It just makes no freeking sense in this age where everybody has one of these

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:40.655
one of these 

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:41.846
make it make sense 

00:00:41.847 --> 00:00:45.840
Okay you can ask for directions if you're like a granny or a grampy

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:46.412
you're allowed
