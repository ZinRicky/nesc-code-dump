00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.120
what do you do last minute

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:04.680
when an outfit does not fit and you have to wear it out tomorrow

00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:07.140
here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna adapt

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.760
um so my friend phaith is partnering with PLT and designed this outfit very

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:16.180
very cute my fat ass doesn't really fit in it because there's no stretch

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.120
and I'm like

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.560
on the border of like

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:19.520
a 26 28

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.160
and PLT goes up to 26 you see

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:23.540
so there's no stretch doesn't usually work

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.680
um my fault

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:26.400
my bad so here's the thing

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.280
this top if I had

00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:29.780
if I had to go out in this

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.220
like I can make it work

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.960
um only problem is like

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:35.820
I feel as though if I breathe wrong

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.280
this is it's coming out

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:40.200
you know what I mean so here's the option

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.960
and also this is not the way that this top is supposed to be wear like this

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:45.000
this is not a strap it's supposed to go like

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.920
right here but uh

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.200
that's just is um

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:49.380
this that wouldn't work

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.180
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna adapt

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.000
and we're gonna scrap the top

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:55.480
I'm just like sorry love

00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:56.160
you can't wear it

00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:59.240
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put on this set from Pretty Little Thing

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.460
which is like

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.760
one of the most iconic sets right

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.400
I'm gonna use a skirt as a top

00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:06.660
and I'm gonna pair with these two things

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.960
that's the vibe in case you're curious

00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:11.380
this is this is kind of how the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.460
this this is what I put around my neck

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.920
um and I kind of ripped it

00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:16.640
but like

00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:18.300
this like

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.380
is a very precarious situation that I'm in right now

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.980
and if I let go or if I literally bent down the wrong way

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.400
this would open so that's why I was putting it around

00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:28.520
if I had to wear it like that

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.760
I would but this top is like

00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:32.320
it's not it's not

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:33.720
it wouldn't do you see what I'm saying

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:34.680
it wouldn't work um

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:36.080
so I'm gonna wear the skirt as a top

00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:36.880
cool

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.480
so I figured out this is this is kind of the vibe I'm going with now

00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:43.640
this is a pretty little thing set um

00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:45.340
and im just wearing the skirt as a top ha ha

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.720
iâ€™m wearing the skirt as the top my friends over there

00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:49.800
um so this is it

00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:51.120
this is what I'm gonna wear tomorrow

00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:52.062
and I think it looks good
