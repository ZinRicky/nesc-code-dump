00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.120
okay let's go ahead and unpack this comment

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:05.281
because you started it by calling my children in general spawn

00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:06.921
so you just wanted to humanize

00:00:06.922 --> 00:00:09.001
you even admit that it's derogatory

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.641
but you don't care because you were a jerk who's happy being a jerk

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:12.481
and that's fine

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:14.441
I wanna touch on the second part of this conversation

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:15.601
which is that um

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:17.681
bad child behavior is an epidemic in this country

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:19.121
and that teachers are even commenting it

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:20.921
because I have also seen all those videos

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:22.841
and I am also a parent within the community

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:25.721
and I've seen all sorts of parenting and all sorts of the results of it

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.161
so let's come have a conversation

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:29.781
because I would agree that a lot of the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.560
what we're gonna call bad parenting

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:34.961
that other people seem to believe creates bad behave children

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:36.161
and I don't like using the word bad

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:37.321
but just for the sake of this argument

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:38.241
you know what I'm talking about

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:40.061
it's usually permissive parenting

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.240
because authoritarian parenting makes kids afraid of adults

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:45.681
permissive parenting is a lack of boundaries and structure

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:46.921
the path of least resistance

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:49.361
those the parents that you see ignoring their children

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:51.801
climbing the walls at an establishment and you're thinking

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:52.761
don't they see this

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:54.121
can't they do something about that

00:00:54.122 --> 00:00:55.801
but whereas teachers are making this content

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:58.701
because they would like to provide a more conducive

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.260
and safe learning environment for the children that are under their charge

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.440
and a better work environment

00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:04.401
for themselves

00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:06.801
um you're just worried about your own individual comfort

00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:08.561
so we're not gonna worry about that

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:10.441
because I don't care about your individual comfort

00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:14.721
what I do care about is children and parents and teachers

00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:16.481
because when we notice there's a problem

00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:18.601
when we acknowledge that there is an issue

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:20.761
and that permissive parenting is probably the issue

00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:21.921
we have to look at the why

00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:24.081
if you actually wanna solve anything and be constructive

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:26.921
so why is permissive parenting becoming such a big thing

00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:30.001
it's not that this is just a random group of individuals who just decided

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:30.441
you know what

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:33.161
I just don't care what my kids do whatever

00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:34.921
no it is because setting boundaries

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:38.321
holding expectations of parenting thoughtfully has a

00:01:38.322 --> 00:01:40.281
an excessive amount of energy

00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:43.161
resources and effort needed to do that

00:01:43.162 --> 00:01:47.081
something that societally we do not make easy for parent

00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:51.041
most households right now are two working income parents

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:54.921
which means parents are getting home at the end of the day already exhausted

00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:56.121
already depleted

00:01:56.122 --> 00:01:59.921
probably working more than they should for less than they're being paid for

00:01:59.922 --> 00:02:01.721
dealing with increasing behaviour problems

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:04.181
because of access to technology and social media

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.480
as well as a society that sets up absolutely no safety nets

00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:08.961
for our parents and children

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.921
has no subsidized child care

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:16.101
no government aid really for parents in the form of maternity

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.080
paternity healthcare

00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:23.641
we also have school systems who are not equipped to follow things like 504 and IEPs correctly

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:25.201
for kids that do have higher needs

00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:29.001
and then on top of it we have parents that are increasingly isolated

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:31.681
we have communities that do not bond together

00:02:31.682 --> 00:02:33.121
that do not create a village

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:37.061
what we have is a society that wants to shame and blame like you

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.440
because what is good for parents

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:39.681
what is good for children

00:02:39.682 --> 00:02:41.801
and what is good for society as a whole

00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:44.641
is for parents and children to be out in a social setting

00:02:44.642 --> 00:02:46.981
with the mentality of a collective village

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.840
all looking out for these kids um

00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:52.201
but instead so that's a perfect storm

00:02:52.202 --> 00:02:55.381
it's a perfect storm of overworked

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.360
underserved socially ostracized people with children

00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:01.961
and that's assuming two parent households

00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:08.421
of which we're not even acknowledging the immense amount of energy

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.740
and exhaustion

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.200
and work that is put on the shoulder of single parents

00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:15.341
so they take the path of least resistance

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.480
but instead of making this an individualistic problem

00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:21.301
this is a one parent who's just a bad parent

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.300
we could actually look at how we collectively handle children pregnancy families

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.240
and make a society that would be conducive to collective parenting

00:03:32.241 --> 00:03:33.601
to respectful parenting

00:03:33.602 --> 00:03:35.681
to parenting with consciousness and effort

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.921
cause the reality is parents can't do it alone

00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:39.521
they were never meant to

00:03:39.522 --> 00:03:44.361
and they definitely were never meant to do it under the strains of capitalism

00:03:44.362 --> 00:03:45.741
so if you really give a shit

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.660
let's talk about the why
