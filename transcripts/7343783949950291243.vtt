00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.920
So you're paying for his attorney,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.120
for his kids?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.660
Like for that whole thing?

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.520
What? I don't get it.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.320
What do you mean?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.600
Oh my gosh, yeah,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.520
of course I'm helping him.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.100
That woman he was with was so evil,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.340
she left him homeless,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.480
bankrupt, with nothing.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.280
He needs somebody to help him get back on his feet.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.760
He's an amazing father.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.100
Of course I'm gonna pay for his attorney

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.380
to fight for his kids.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.880
What are you talking about?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.800
What? I mean, it just.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200
It sounds like it's like a really risky move

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.440
cause it's like a lot of money.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.920
And if he's homeless and unemployed,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.360
like, I don't see how that has really anything to do

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.080
with the woman he was just dating.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.280
Like the mother of his children.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.300
It seems like that's

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.080
totally separate from why he's in a situation he's in.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.640
And it feels like

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.640
maybe he's just trying to drag you down and like,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.140
use up all your money.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.780
Aren't you afraid of that?

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.160
I knew you were jealous of our relationship.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.520
And he told me that you would have something to say

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.880
like this. He's seen you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.420
and what kind of friend you are to me.
