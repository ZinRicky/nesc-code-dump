00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
This just reminds me of a little story time of how not a fairy tale,

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:09.541
how opposite from a fairy tale my life was in. In that time.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.840
When we got married,

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:13.561
we didn't have enough money to have, like,

00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:14.081
a big wedding,

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:14.881
so we just eloped.

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:15.481
So, like,

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.401
I have. I had, like,

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:20.361
a little dress that I bought just from a little store,

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:22.181
a little boutique here in Denver.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.240
Like, he came with me to buy my dress.

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:25.001
Nobody was there.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:25.801
We didn't have family.

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:26.681
I didn't have bridesmaids.

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:28.281
I didn't do any of the things that I wanted,

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:30.541
like, all the things that I dreamed of as a little girl.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.440
But it was because,

00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:33.001
you know, we were young and,

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:35.661
you know, he was unemployed,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.520
and we were just gonna,

00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:38.761
you know, get through it with love.

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:42.081
And we made a promise that our 10 year wedding anniversary,

00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:43.921
we would have the wedding that I always dreamed of.

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:46.901
And we had 10 years to save up for it, and we were gonna do that.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.420
And every time I wanted to save up for it, anytime I would, like,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.680
like, I remember around, like, year 8,

00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:54.161
I was like, hey,

00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:55.881
we kind of get big tax returns.

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:57.921
Why don't we just save our next couple tax returns,

00:00:57.922 --> 00:00:59.421
and then we can start planning?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.160
I would love for my father to walk me down the aisle.

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.001
I would love to have the father daughter dance.

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:04.961
Like, all the things That,

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:07.001
you know, you promised me.

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:08.221
And I know, like,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.440
in 10 years, our life still isn't where we thought it would be.

00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:14.121
But can I at least get this?

00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:17.521
Can I at least get the wedding that you promised me 10 years ago?

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:20.281
And I have faithfully been your wife

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:23.081
and done all the things that I needed to do. Well,

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.561
we did not save appropriately.

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:26.841
We did not have the wedding of my dreams.

00:01:26.842 --> 00:01:29.281
And that was fine.

00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:32.781
I was willing to put it off longer.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.440
We did have a child with a disability in the middle,

00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:38.081
and there was a lot going on in our life.

00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:38.961
So I thought, okay,

00:01:38.962 --> 00:01:40.761
maybe we could do it 11 year,

00:01:40.762 --> 00:01:42.421
12 years, something else.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.300
Um. But I wanted a special night out.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.260
Well, after I had to book the babysitter,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.420
and I made the reservations, and I planned the whole evening.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.400
All he had to do is get dressed and show up on time.

00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:58.901
And we lived in the same fucking house.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.320
He was literally late.

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.521
He ended up, like,

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.801
doing dumb shit that day that I was like,

00:02:04.802 --> 00:02:07.401
are you sure this is a good time to be doing that?

00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:08.741
Cause we're going out later.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.860
And I got told how controlling and shitty I was.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.140
And then,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.200
yeah, he realized he didn't have clean clothes or good clothes or.

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:21.281
I don't know, he wanted to feel special.

00:02:21.282 --> 00:02:22.881
He wanted to get me something.

00:02:22.882 --> 00:02:26.121
So, like, literally 30 minutes before The babysitter was gonna get there.

00:02:26.122 --> 00:02:30.421
He ran to target to buy himself a shirt and then to get me flowers.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.440
And so he walked in the door 30 minutes late for the date

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:35.521
cause we had reservations,

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:36.321
we had a babysitter.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.841
I had, like, things timed and planned.

00:02:37.842 --> 00:02:39.541
I put a lot of effort into this.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.280
I, my heart was broken.

00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:43.361
I saw these, like,

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:45.861
target flowers and I was like.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.120
And I mean, I happily accepted them and went along with the night,

00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:54.641
but I mean, it was just like,

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:58.081
there are those milestone moments that you look back and you're like,

00:02:58.082 --> 00:03:00.401
yeah, that was one of the, like,

00:03:00.402 --> 00:03:02.801
bricks coming down of that wall,

00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:06.721
that thought that was holding me back between me and divorce,

00:03:06.722 --> 00:03:07.541
you know?

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.440
So I totally understand the feeling of it

00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:13.481
not even being close to the fairy tale you thought.

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:16.701
And I promise you, the thought and that feeling doesn't go away.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.720
These people don't really change because why would they?

00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:22.761
What incentive do they have to change?

00:03:22.762 --> 00:03:25.861
You're doing everything right now,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.120
receiving whatever bullshit they give you.

00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:30.461
So why would they change?

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.680
That's not human nature to just be like,

00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:35.781
I'm gonna make my life a little bit harder for no reason,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.560
you know what I mean?

00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:40.161
So if it's not in him to do it,

00:03:40.162 --> 00:03:40.841
it's not in him.

00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:43.661
And you can still get that fairy tale.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.500
So I'm sending you love.
