If you think that matcha tastes like grass,

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.441
then you just haven't had a good matcha.

00:00:03.442 --> 00:00:04.561
Let me show you how to make one.

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:06.921
You're gonna Wanna start by heating up some warm water.

00:00:06.922 --> 00:00:08.121
Not hot, warm.

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:09.641
You're gonna use this whisk

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:12.481
and you're gonna soak it in some warm water to soften the bristles.

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:15.821
I got this matcha set and this matcha on Amazon,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.440
and I think it's great for beginners.

00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:18.881
I use about a teaspoon of matcha,

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:21.921
and then I sift it through because of how fine the powder is.

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:24.281
And then I add the warm water,

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:29.661
not hot. And you wanna do Z whisking motions until it's a nice frost.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.980
And then my favorite thing has been to add vanilla bean paste

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.300
and the stevia.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.360
It tastes so good.

00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:38.041
You could also add honey or maple syrup.

00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:42.121
And then I use half a cup of almond milk and half a cup of this

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:42.641
half and half.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.961
That's absolutely delicious.

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:47.486
And then you have the perfect homemade matcha. Try it out.
