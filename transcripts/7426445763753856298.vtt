00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.080
moms all over the internet are sharing their 17 diapers

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:05.800
in reference to that mom who was struggling in postpartum

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:07.320
to take care of herself her toddler

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:09.280
her Newborn because her husband wasn't home

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:11.480
and ended up having kind of a messy house

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:14.200
and what they're sharing are the realities of postpartum depression

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:16.540
postpartum anxiety and postpartum psychosis

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.000
and I personally have found it incredibly cathartic

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.680
I have heard I haven't shared mine on here yet

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:24.160
but I've talked about it before on here

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:26.000
about my struggles with postpartum anxiety

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.280
because the people who are shaming the mom for having a dirty house

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:31.700
have no idea the depths of the struggle

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.000
of what it means to fight your own mind and fight demons within your own mind

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.400
they're out of your control

00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:40.700
when I was in the depths of suffering from postpartum anxiety

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.120
I wasn't sure if I was going to make it

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:46.400
make it out you know

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:49.680
what you see on the news is always the worst case scenario

00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:51.360
you know the mom who finally snaps

00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:53.440
who either analyze herself or her children

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:57.240
but what you don't see often is the most commonplace scenarios

00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.420
which is the suffering and silence that so many women do

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.320
you know a lot of moms are prepared to be sad

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.560
have the baby blues or whatever you wanna call it

00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:08.400
but what I wasn't prepared for was panic attacks anxiety

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.200
intrusive thoughts

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:12.760
some of the like most horrific things rolling through my brain

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:14.960
as scenarios that I either were gonna cause

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.420
or had to find a way to save my babies from

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.760
and I just hope with the invention of social media

00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:22.040
and how prevalent we are at sharing the realities of motherhood

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.840
that we are preparing the next generation of mothers to know the warning signs

00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:29.960
and see the most common place struggles of postpartum depression

00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:31.160
anxiety and psychosis

00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:35.560
before they are drowning and before the worst case scenarios happen

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:39.120
because we all know it's gonna be up to us as a community and us as individuals

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:40.480
to prepare other women

00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:44.060
and not the systems that we have in place to actually support women

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.800
but I know for me

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:47.640
it has been incredibly healing to see these being shared online

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.180
so maybe I'll share mine soon

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.086
or maybe this is me sharing my 17 diapers
