00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.700
I wouldn't be a good person if I didn't share this information with you

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.000
Whole Foods has prepped meals that you can buy for 26.99

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:11.658
Look at all this food that you get 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:12.321
sweet potatoes

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:13.501
roasted chicken

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.280
and green beans

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.881
this can feed me for an entire week

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:20.481
or a full grown man for like four or five meals

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.881
I saw another tiktoker talking about this

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:24.281
I can't remember her name

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:25.881
she shared this information

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:27.889
and I think it was the same price  

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.381
Apparently not all Whole Foods grocery stores does this

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.200
but look at how much food you get for $26

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:33.081
Are you kidding me

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:35.361
this is a meal preppers dream

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:36.761
I meal prep every week

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:39.205
and this is gonna save me so much time 

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.521
because you get yummy

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:41.601
delicious chicken

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:42.401
sweet potatoes

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:45.961
I never eat those because they're too much work to cook up myself

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:46.801
and green beans

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:49.481
so simple, basic meal prep hack

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.761
I also bought these little meal prep containers 

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:54.141
what I'm gonna do is just divide each portion

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.960
this literally made me so many meals

00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.241
seven meals $26

00:01:18.242 --> 00:01:19.280
I'm set for the week
