00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.760
if you are dating someone who refuses to share locations with you

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:06.791
what are you doing?

00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:08.040
some people are like oh

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.560
“that's an invasion of privacy”

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:11.280
“I don't want people to check in on me”

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:12.960
why?? what are you doing?

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:16.720
like my friends and family all have my location and I have theirs

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:19.920
it's usually for safety and also curiosity

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:21.240
but it's fine they do the same thing

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:23.400
sometimes it's just for fun to check in on them 

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:26.600
but what are you doing that you don't want them to have your location?

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:29.880
I want the people I love to know that I'm safe

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:33.560
The only times I have concerns about sharing my locations with my husband

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:38.100
is when I'm going to target or Homegoods for the third time this week

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000
but other than that I genuinely cannot think of a reason

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.200
why I would not wanna share my location with my partner

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:46.160
like unless you're doing something shady

00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:48.220
that is the only thing I can think of

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.000
I know so many people are torn on this

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:53.280
but if you don't want your location shared why?

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:55.560
What’s the reason.. and make it a good one.

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:58.180
because it literally does not make sense to me.
