Come with me to see a movie alone.

00:02.081 --> 00:04.281
I am a mom of two, and I'm very social,

00:04.282 --> 00:07.041
so I rarely ever go out by myself.

00:07.042 --> 00:09.801
But this one night, I decided to go after my kids were asleep.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.241
My husband was home.

00:11.242 --> 00:14.161
I just decided to see this random Liam Neeson movie.

00:14.162 --> 00:17.161
I thought it would be interesting and fun to just relax and watch it.

00:17.162 --> 00:19.181
I got my very own popcorn.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.560
Didn't have to share with anyone.

00:20.561 --> 00:22.621
I also got an ice cream later on.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.800
But I saw the first five or so minutes of this movie,

00:25.801 --> 00:27.081
and I just thought it was kinda boring

00:27.082 --> 00:28.441
and it kinda felt like a dude movie.

00:28.442 --> 00:32.001
So I got up and I went to the theater next to me,

00:32.002 --> 00:33.361
and it was this romantic movie.

00:33.362 --> 00:36.001
It was kind of weird. Weird ending,

00:36.002 --> 00:39.841
but kind of interesting and juicy and just fun and relaxing.

00:39.842 --> 00:42.401
Highly recommend going out by yourself every now and then.
