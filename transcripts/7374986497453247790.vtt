00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.600
My husband woke up craving enchiladas, which is no surprise,

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.041
so I decided to make them for him for dinner.

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:07.481
I got started that afternoon

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.681
by removing the stems and seeds from Wahiyo,

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:12.801
California and ancho chilies and then charring them over the stove.

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:15.441
Meanwhile, I quickly prepared some of my non toxic

00:00:15.442 --> 00:00:17.201
all purpose cleaner from Branch Basics,

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:20.081
which is the only product I buy to clean the entire house laundry

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:23.041
reincluded the chili sauce is blended together with some herbs.

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:24.701
Soboia Yahoo we saw,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.240
along with some of the cooking water so it's not too thick.

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:29.881
I separated the whole chicken I had baked the day before,

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:31.721
shredded it, then seasoned it with salt.

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:33.481
Making the enchiladas takes a little finesse

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:35.041
and I started by dipping organic

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.261
corn tortillas into the enchilada sauce,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.480
then frying it in tallow

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:40.841
and then rolling it up with chicken and raw cheese.

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:43.201
I lined a casserole dish with the enchiladas

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:44.801
and topped with raw cheese and foil

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:46.521
and let that bake for about 20 minutes

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:49.041
while I cleaned my charred pans and loaded the dishwasher.

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:51.121
The grease and grime came right off of my pan

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:52.761
after a brief 10 minutes soak.

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:53.681
So crazy cool.

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:55.401
And these cleaning products are so natural

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:56.721
you can wash your berries in it.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.161
There's nothing quite like a fully loaded enchilada.

00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:01.681
So I prepared my toppings along with some raw crema

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:03.521
so that when the enchiladas came out of the oven

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:04.901
they were ready to be loaded.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.160
With the clean kitchen and family at the dining table,

00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:09.601
I topped the enchiladas off with the salsa.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.681
Chopped lechuga saboya e crema.

00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:14.081
Las enchiladas estaban mues abrosas,

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:16.934
which means they were so flavorful and we loved them.
