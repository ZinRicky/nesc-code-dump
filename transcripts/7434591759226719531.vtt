00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
I'm a tribe wife. I got married at 18.

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:03.201
My husband is the main breadwinner,

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.741
and I'm pregnant with our first child.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.660
What would I do if my husband died?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.440
This question I've been asked many times

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.781
from both naysayers and just curious individuals,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.400
people who have been in the same situation before.

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:16.681
And I thought it was about time to answer this in depth.

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:19.321
So welcome to my series on emergency protocols.

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.861
I'm gonna share some of the things that we have set up

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.600
to make a transition if one of us dies

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:28.281
a little bit easier. Just on an admin side of things.

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:29.881
I hope that this helps you

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:31.561
if you're trying to figure out the same sort of thing.

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:34.041
So first, we are joint on all bank accounts.

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:36.661
I have my own line of credit and a credit score.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.000
We're joint owners on our house and land.

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.021
I've access to all of the passwords and email accounts.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.600
We both have life insurance.

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:44.641
It's a small policy,

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:48.181
but it's enough to cover funeral expenses and the cost of moving.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.800
We have an emergency fund and additional savings.

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:55.041
We have a will with final wishes and a designated trustee,

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:57.461
estate manager, someone to handle all of those things.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.920
Chance of both of us dying in a car crash is actually kind of high.

00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:04.881
So our cars both transfer on death to my father in law.

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:06.801
And then if just my husband was to die,

00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:08.961
then they would get transferred To me,

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:10.161
we always pay bills together,

00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:11.761
so I know exactly how to pay bills,

00:01:11.762 --> 00:01:14.941
but most of them are on auto pay from a credit card.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.160
If something happened and we forgot to pay a Bill,

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.181
it would get paid and the lights would stay on.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.680
Like and follow. For part two,

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.483
as we continue talking about emergency protocols. To have
