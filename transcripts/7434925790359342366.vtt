00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.060
Since black women are done,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.160
rightfully so, I totally get it.

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.141
They're done educating, they're done teaching,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.460
they're done helping any of us.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.280
I feel it's somebody's gotta fucking do the part.

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:13.961
Their part. I'm not a white woman.

00:00:13.962 --> 00:00:15.761
I know I look like one, I know I pass for one,

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:17.021
but I'm not a white woman.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.720
So to the white women with this like,

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:21.321
blue bracelet idea, cause you want everybody in the world to know

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.441
you're not one of those white women.

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:24.521
You are still centering yourself.

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:26.241
You're still getting it wrong.

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:27.361
Just because you voted the.

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:33.361
The right way doesn't necessarily make you an ally or a friend

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:36.221
or make. Make sure that you're doing all the right things.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.480
As a white woman who voted the right way.

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.761
You should, instead of being so concerned

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:44.801
with everybody knowing that you voted the right way.

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:46.241
So now you wanna wear a blue bracelet

00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:48.221
cause you just don't wanna be blamed for this.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.520
That's. You're missing the whole fucking point.

00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:54.161
Now it's your job to step up and speak and.

00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:56.081
And educate and talk to your friends

00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:59.721
and get the women to leave their shitty husbands and to,

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:01.861
you know, do all the right things.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.720
It's not just about showing your.

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.241
I didn't do. It wasn't my fault.

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:07.821
You're still centering yourself.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.080
It wasn't my fault. I didn't do that.

00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:10.921
I did the right thing. I'm one of the cool white women.

00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:12.441
Cause don't you think the white women

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:14.401
Who did vote the wrong way

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:16.681
are gonna just get the same fucking blue bracelet

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:18.661
so they can be accepted like you.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.920
It's not about the blue bracelet.

00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:23.481
It's not about people knowing you voted what way you voted.

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:27.341
It's about doing what's right for the people around you.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.460
So maybe give up on the fucking bracelet

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.953
and start using your voice a little bit more.
