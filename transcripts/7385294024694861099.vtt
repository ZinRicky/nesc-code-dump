00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.320
So here's a hot take about all of this discussion

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:04.301
about putting religion into school.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.620
You're gonna make everyone dumber,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.040
which is already a problem with the American public education system,

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:14.381
but is going to be further perpetuated by making religion.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.200
And let's be serious. We're not talking about religion.

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.581
We're talking about Christianity.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.440
Um, a mandatory thing in schools.

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.421
With the introduction of the Ten Commandments into school,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.600
um, with prayer.

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:26.281
And now I just saw that Oklahoma

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:29.301
is pushing to have the Bible taught in public education.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.680
Now, before you come with your pitchforks,

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:32.881
I am a religious person. I am Jewish.

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:34.661
I am religiously practicing.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.360
I believe in the Ten Commandments.

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.241
My children go to religious school.

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:40.161
But I never want religion taught,

00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:42.961
especially any of the major three Abrahamic religions

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:44.761
taught in public school. Number one,

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:46.161
because school is for everyone.

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:48.961
It is a publicly funded environment

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:53.561
that should cater to everybody's educational needs.

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:56.381
Not every student needs to be taught the Christian Bible.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.960
Number two, teaching the Bible comes in one of two ways.

00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:01.161
One, you're being taught the Bible as doctrine,

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:02.881
so as unrefutable fact.

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:05.281
Okay, so what that calls for in your students is, like,

00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:07.841
a suspended disbelief. Because let's be serious,

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:10.841
under the lens of modern scientific understanding,

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:12.361
there's a lot to question there.

00:01:12.362 --> 00:01:14.721
So if it is being taught as irrefutable facts,

00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:15.881
you are therefore, like,

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:19.201
limiting your children's development of critical thinking skills

00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:21.841
and analytic observation. Now,

00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:23.961
if we're using It as a moral compass.

00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:27.001
I'm under the impression that teaching your children religion

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:29.241
and especially religious morality

00:01:29.242 --> 00:01:32.121
in all of the ways that those are wrapped up together

00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:36.181
is a parents prerogative. That is not a state right.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.520
It would be much more useful for students

00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:41.581
to be learning things like ethics,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.480
especially when it comes to ethics in business,

00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:49.081
than it ever would be to be using the Christian Bible

00:01:49.082 --> 00:01:51.841
as a moral compass for all students

00:01:51.842 --> 00:01:53.361
in a public education setting.

00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:54.961
There are options for schooling

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:56.721
for people who want a religious education,

00:01:56.722 --> 00:01:58.301
and I think that is wonderful.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.440
But a public education

00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:02.461
should both be welcoming to everyone within the public

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.840
and be fostering skills

00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:06.521
that will be useful as a member of the general public

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:10.001
later on. Which I think includes critical thinking skills,

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:13.181
media literacy, and ethics as a code of conduct.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.020
All religion in school is a bad idea when it comes to public education,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.541
and we're gonna be dumber because of it.
