00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
I bought this for laundry because,

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:03.681
you know, there's a million kids.

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:06.361
We got a lot of laundry. Here's what I'm thinking, though.

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:10.021
For Christmas, I always give my kids a gift from Santa.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.280
And Santa does not give them the big fucking gift,

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:15.281
because fuck that. I get the glory,

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.281
not Santa. I give them the big gift.

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:18.921
Santa gives them some little shit that they like.

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:23.261
The tinker toys and shit. So there's four kids,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.320
and the kids always talk about board games and shit.

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:29.921
I feel like I could fill this with a bunch of,

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:33.041
like, board games and blankets and slippers.

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:34.941
Like, cute shit for the kids.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.500
And just be their big Christmas gift for the kids.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.400
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:43.301
Don't you think that's a really cute idea?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.310
That's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna use it for laundry.
