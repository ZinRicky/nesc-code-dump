00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
8:30, Hurricane update.

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.321
Our powers are flickering.

00:00:03.322 --> 00:00:06.541
So we got the kids ready, put them in bed,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.140
got a bedtime playlist. The wind is whooping. We have what is called.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.120
Yeah, like,

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:17.441
the impact windows, and so normally you can't hear, like,

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:20.581
rain or anything, and we can return here.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.960
So it's intensifying.

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:25.001
Trying to get the kids to sleep before we lose power,

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.001
before the worst of it. And honestly,

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.521
I think I'm gonna do a melatonin

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:30.421
and try to sleep through the whole storm,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.880
man. Just freaking out a little bit.

00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:34.761
Yeah, she has PTSD from Ian.

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:37.301
We took a direct hit from Ian two years ago,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.600
and she is old enough to remember that part of it,

00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:43.061
and so, yeah,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.960
remember is fine. Yeah,

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.121
he only remembers parts that we told him about.

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:49.601
So she's freaking out a little bit.

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:53.421
So we're all gonna go to sleep and hopefully wake up and it's over.
