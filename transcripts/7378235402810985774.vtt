00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.780
um these top two books are

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.740
that's why they were at the top

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.800
this book look

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:08.040
it's a declaration of independence

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.280
this just kind of go

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:15.000
because this is the word that loves to be thrown at us to try to really hurt us

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.260
it's oh

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.080
so I love to just empower myself with knowledge

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:23.700
how you gonna hurt me if I'm proud of the fucking word myself bitch

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.040
love that one

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.320
it's a fucking classic

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.640
this is actually like the real

00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:30.540
this is the 20th anniversary edition

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.740
girl this is like number one

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.420
feminism 1:01

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.120
this one blew my fucking mind though

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.600
and this one really fucking pissed me off

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:40.560
when god was a woman

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:40.920
oh my god

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:43.860
this is the one that blew my mind with this book

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.020
listen to this bullshit

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.220
before humans understood how children were born

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.860
women were regarded as fucking goddesses

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.420
that's not a myth

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.280
they didn't understand where babies came from

00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:08.460
all they knew was we're all naked and fuckin

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.240
every now and then when you see one of them look really full

00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:13.140
uh uh

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.500
a baby's gonna come

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.020
and then she has a baby and oh my god

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.380
these people are goddesses among us

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.760
and everybody just lived communally

00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:24.280
it was a matriarchal society

00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:26.600
and that doesn't mean the opposite of a patriarchy

00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:29.080
it's not like women ruled with an iron fist

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:30.940
it was a completely different

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.340
you know setting for the culture the way culture was

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.720
and the one little bitch who wasn't fucking and participating

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.220
must have figured it out

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.400
ratted everybody out

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:43.860
figured out what it was

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.400
made up all these rules about spilling seed and blah blah blah

00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:48.780
entered all these rules

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.960
and then god became a man

00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:51.980
and now the patriarchy sucks
