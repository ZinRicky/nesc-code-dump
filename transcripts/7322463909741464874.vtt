00:00.120 --> 00:01.440
Ladies, so today

00:01.440 --> 00:03.040
I have a fun video idea.

00:03.040 --> 00:05.640
I'm gonna share with you guys some tips and tricks

00:05.640 --> 00:08.580
to feel more feminine and girly in the gym

00:08.720 --> 00:10.820
and to appear that way.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.780
And I understand that this is

00:12.920 --> 00:15.000
something that a lot of girls want to feel,

00:15.000 --> 00:16.160
and I totally get it.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.980
So I hope these tips and tricks help you guys.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.600
And I'm going to be sharing a little bit of

00:21.600 --> 00:24.900
outfit inspiration in this video as well.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.900
So let's get started.

00:27.040 --> 00:29.680
So this was a really requested video I got

00:29.680 --> 00:31.620
when I did a poll on Instagram

00:31.680 --> 00:34.160
asking you guys what videos you wanted to see.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.920
And feel free to comment here

00:35.920 --> 00:37.600
under the comment section

00:37.600 --> 00:39.920
what kind of videos you wanna see from me as well,

00:39.920 --> 00:42.500
because I'm curious what you guys wanna see more of.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.240
And, um. Anyways,

00:44.240 --> 00:46.220
so let's get started on this video.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.280
So the first thing you wanna remember

00:48.280 --> 00:51.940
when it comes to dressing feminine in the gym is

00:52.000 --> 00:56.240
do not let the way you look interfere with your workout

00:56.240 --> 00:58.160
or getting yourself into the gym.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.200
Because the most important thing is that you are

01:00.200 --> 01:01.300
getting into the gym,

01:01.320 --> 01:03.020
you are working on yourself.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.320
You are, um, maybe strength training or cardio

01:06.320 --> 01:07.600
or whatever you're doing,

01:07.600 --> 01:10.000
you are bettering yourself and your health.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.420
That is your priority.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.380
Not looking super cute,

01:13.520 --> 01:16.040
but there are a couple things you can do to make

01:16.040 --> 01:19.120
yourself feel more confident when getting into the gym.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.040
And I feel like this is a good time to make this video

01:21.040 --> 01:22.920
because it's the beginning of January.

01:22.920 --> 01:23.440
I think it's like

01:23.440 --> 01:26.620
January 8th or something. So, yeah.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.380
Tip number one is comfort and quality.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.680
You wanna find workout clothes

01:30.680 --> 01:32.420
that make you feel comfortable.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.260
The fabric, the fit,

01:34.400 --> 01:36.560
and that will make you feel the most confident.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.040
So I understand that

01:38.040 --> 01:40.340
some people don't like certain fabrics.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.900
Some people like a really compressioned pair of pants.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.600
Some people like something a little bit more relaxed.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.520
Some people want to wear sweatpants,

01:48.520 --> 01:50.520
some people want to wear leggings.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.380
Find what makes you feel the most comfortable

01:53.440 --> 01:55.520
and definitely stick with that style.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.100
Personally, I have one pair of sweatpants,

01:58.240 --> 01:59.600
and I try not to wear that

01:59.600 --> 02:01.740
unless I'm doing something really dirty,

02:02.040 --> 02:03.520
and I try to avoid that,

02:03.520 --> 02:04.620
even at the gym.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.040
But it's okay to wear sweatpants,

02:06.040 --> 02:07.400
because I totally understand

02:07.400 --> 02:09.400
the modesty behind wearing sweatpants.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.480
But I wear leggings,

02:10.480 --> 02:11.900
and that's just what I do.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.500
And do what makes you feel comfortable.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.600
And there is a way you can wear leggings

02:16.600 --> 02:18.440
and be more modest in the gym,

02:18.440 --> 02:20.560
and I'm gonna show you guys how you can do that.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.080
So let's talk about quality.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.860
I do think quality is important,

02:23.880 --> 02:26.140
especially when it comes to working out.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.160
The worst thing

02:27.160 --> 02:29.280
that could possibly happen is if you're working out

02:29.280 --> 02:31.300
and you feel like your pants are see through

02:31.320 --> 02:34.000
or something's not holding up right.

02:34.000 --> 02:34.840
You want to make sure

02:34.840 --> 02:36.800
The quality of your clothes is good.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.400
So I do recommend

02:38.400 --> 02:40.780
splurging a little bit on workout clothes.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.000
And when it comes to splurging on anything,

02:43.000 --> 02:45.700
I highly recommend splurging on pants.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.200
You can't go wrong with a good pair of pants.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.140
I think you can actually

02:50.320 --> 02:51.720
get cheaper tops

02:51.720 --> 02:53.120
and that can totally work.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.360
But when it comes to pants,

02:54.360 --> 02:55.720
you really wanna make sure

02:55.720 --> 02:57.880
that they are gonna hold up for your workout

02:57.880 --> 03:00.060
and do what you need them to do.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.440
This part is not budget friendly,

03:02.440 --> 03:05.000
but I do really like Lululemon leggings.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.840
I think that they hold up really well

03:06.840 --> 03:08.700
and they do what they're supposed to do.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.120
And the feeling of them,

03:11.120 --> 03:11.640
the quality,

03:11.640 --> 03:13.000
I think it's really great

03:13.000 --> 03:15.600
and I would much rather have a nice pair of pants

03:15.600 --> 03:16.980
than a nice top.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.560
And you don't have to ever worry about pants being

03:19.560 --> 03:21.060
see through with Lululemon.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.860
At least I've never had that issue.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.700
So I do recommend them.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.460
And I will say this,

03:26.520 --> 03:29.720
I have accumulated quite a few Lululemon clothes

03:29.720 --> 03:32.360
because when I was in my bodybuilding phase,

03:32.360 --> 03:34.160
having really nice workout clothes

03:34.160 --> 03:36.140
was a really big priority of mine.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.000
So I do highly recommend them.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.480
But you don't need that many.

03:40.480 --> 03:43.120
You can have two pair of pants and a couple tops

03:43.120 --> 03:45.120
and just wash it more frequently.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.680
The most important thing is that you are

03:46.680 --> 03:47.800
getting in the gym.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.160
So now let's talk about colors.

03:50.160 --> 03:50.880
Colors I think

03:50.880 --> 03:51.600
are so Important

03:51.600 --> 03:53.000
because what you wear

03:53.000 --> 03:54.080
and the color of it,

03:54.080 --> 03:55.980
I think, can really help

03:56.040 --> 03:57.560
when it comes to working out

03:57.560 --> 03:58.840
and getting ready for the gym

03:58.840 --> 04:00.020
and feeling cute.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.760
So me personally,

04:01.760 --> 04:03.500
I love bright colors,

04:03.520 --> 04:05.240
and this is a pair of Lululemon pants.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.120
These are just,

04:06.120 --> 04:07.120
like, watercolor

04:07.120 --> 04:08.340
floral pants.

04:08.480 --> 04:08.840
They're, like,

04:08.840 --> 04:09.800
my favorite pair,

04:09.800 --> 04:11.000
and I don't know,

04:11.000 --> 04:12.080
I feel more confident.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.560
I feel really happy when I wear bright colors.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.960
But my younger sister really likes dark colors,

04:16.960 --> 04:19.520
so she has a lot of navy, blues,

04:19.520 --> 04:20.280
dark purples,

04:20.280 --> 04:22.240
blacks in her workout collection,

04:22.240 --> 04:25.100
because that's what she feels most confident in.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.840
So pick colors that make you feel confident

04:27.840 --> 04:29.120
and make you feel happy.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.520
So say I were to have these two pants,

04:31.520 --> 04:32.840
the way I would style it is

04:32.840 --> 04:34.320
I would get a gray

04:34.320 --> 04:35.860
or a black top,

04:36.160 --> 04:37.760
and then I would have a white top,

04:37.760 --> 04:39.120
and then I have two pair of pants

04:39.120 --> 04:40.040
and three tops,

04:40.040 --> 04:41.820
and I could cycle them off,

04:41.880 --> 04:42.680
and that way

04:42.680 --> 04:44.440
I could still get to the gym

04:44.440 --> 04:46.080
and still have cute workout clothes

04:46.080 --> 04:46.680
and have good

04:46.680 --> 04:48.120
quality workout clothes,

04:48.120 --> 04:50.400
but I wouldn't have to worry about having

04:50.400 --> 04:51.440
but so many.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.760
And then over time,

04:52.760 --> 04:54.700
you can add a little bit to your collection.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.900
So now let's talk about styling a little bit.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.400
So when it comes to the gym,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.440
I'm really simple with my styling,

05:01.440 --> 05:03.400
but you can add a little details

05:03.400 --> 05:04.720
to make yourself feel a little more

05:04.720 --> 05:06.280
Girly. So for me,

05:06.280 --> 05:08.860
I love little scrunchies in my hair,

05:08.920 --> 05:10.640
and I have quite a few colors,

05:10.640 --> 05:11.520
and I just enjoy

05:11.520 --> 05:12.960
kind of matching it to my top

05:12.960 --> 05:13.640
or my pants

05:13.640 --> 05:14.980
or something like that.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.400
And that's what makes me feel, like,

05:17.400 --> 05:18.520
cute. And I'm.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.180
I'm really happy scrunchies made a comeback, because,

05:21.680 --> 05:22.120
I don't know,

05:22.120 --> 05:22.980
they're adorable.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.560
But you could also put a little ribbon in your hair,

05:25.560 --> 05:26.280
and it's a cute

05:26.280 --> 05:27.040
little detail

05:27.040 --> 05:28.080
that hopefully

05:28.080 --> 05:29.360
keeps your hair pulled back.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.600
But again, you want it to function properly

05:31.600 --> 05:32.820
for your whole workout.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.980
The last thing you wanna worry about is

05:35.240 --> 05:36.560
your hair ribbon falling out

05:36.560 --> 05:38.160
while you're running on the treadmill, right?

05:38.160 --> 05:39.800
So that's not a priority,

05:39.800 --> 05:40.560
but it can be a cute

05:40.560 --> 05:41.240
little detail

05:41.240 --> 05:42.180
if it works.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.640
And now I wanna show you guys

05:43.640 --> 05:45.360
how you can take a basic shirt

05:45.360 --> 05:46.440
and a pair of leggings

05:46.440 --> 05:47.960
and make it more modest,

05:47.960 --> 05:49.720
especially if you're doing leg day

05:49.720 --> 05:51.180
and you're in a co ed gym

05:51.320 --> 05:53.000
and you just wanna cover up

05:53.000 --> 05:54.280
when you're doing certain workouts

05:54.280 --> 05:55.800
like squats or

05:55.800 --> 05:57.120
Romanian deadlifts.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.720
So what I always do is

05:58.720 --> 06:01.380
I take a jacket with me to the gym,

06:01.760 --> 06:04.300
and I tie it around my waist

06:06.920 --> 06:08.940
like this, and it.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.360
It's. It works great.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.160
I can do my workouts,

06:12.160 --> 06:14.900
and I don't have to worry about, um,

06:15.040 --> 06:18.000
my behind sticking out and drawn all that attention.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.400
So I always bring a jacket with me to the gym,

06:20.400 --> 06:22.880
and I also Wear this when I'm doing cardio

06:22.880 --> 06:24.140
or something like that.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.960
But if you have longer shirts,

06:25.960 --> 06:27.120
that works too.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.800
And that is my other option

06:28.800 --> 06:32.920
is I always bring an oversized shirt to the gym.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.680
This is just my husband's shirt,

06:34.680 --> 06:36.560
and I always bring this as well.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.760
So it's either the jacket around the waist

06:38.760 --> 06:40.360
or an oversized shirt

06:40.360 --> 06:44.260
when I want to conceal more of my behind.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.980
That's a little tip.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.540
So when it comes to makeup or no makeup,

06:48.560 --> 06:51.080
I think you should think about the rest of your day

06:51.080 --> 06:53.440
after you workout and before you workout,

06:53.440 --> 06:55.880
because I think it's just a personal preference.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.160
I wear makeup to the gym.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.180
I always have. I really.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.760
I don't care to take off my makeup

07:00.760 --> 07:01.840
just to go to the gym.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.240
And it's never affected me to wear makeup.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.120
But for some women,

07:05.120 --> 07:06.320
they break out really bad

07:06.320 --> 07:08.140
if they wear makeup to the gym.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.120
So just figure out what works best for you.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.760
But I don't think there's any shame

07:12.760 --> 07:14.320
in wearing little makeup to the gym.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.920
So another little tip I have

07:15.920 --> 07:18.280
is wearing a little bit of a light,

07:18.280 --> 07:19.520
light perfume.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.720
This is just a peppermint perfume,

07:21.720 --> 07:22.960
so it's very light

07:22.960 --> 07:24.280
and it's very refreshing,

07:24.280 --> 07:26.640
and it makes me feel a little bit more put together

07:26.640 --> 07:28.020
when going to the gym,

07:28.400 --> 07:30.920
and I smell more clean and stuff like that.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.460
I wouldn't wear something super sweet to the gym.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.920
I just wanna wear something light.

07:34.920 --> 07:35.720
And refreshing.

07:35.720 --> 07:39.580
So I think I found this one at a gas station.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.500
I don't know.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.040
Gym accessories.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.080
Okay, this is really fun because

07:44.080 --> 07:46.520
I kinda needed this stuff to go to the gym anyways

07:46.520 --> 07:49.240
because this warms up my legs

07:49.240 --> 07:52.080
and I can also use this for different workouts.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.880
These are resistance bands,

07:53.880 --> 07:55.840
and since I needed them anyways,

07:55.840 --> 07:58.440
I invested in shades of pink

07:58.440 --> 07:59.700
so there's medium

07:59.880 --> 08:02.660
light and strong resistance.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.280
So these are just like

08:04.280 --> 08:06.460
one of those little cute things that make me feel

08:06.520 --> 08:07.920
better when I do my workouts.

08:07.920 --> 08:08.960
And they're a little bit more girly

08:08.960 --> 08:10.320
and a little bit more feminine.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.600
And I have my clips.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.320
These are all from Amazon,

08:13.320 --> 08:15.400
both the clips and the resistance bands.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.600
And again, just a fun accessory.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.320
I have pink ankle straps.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.940
Again, these are on Amazon.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.400
A pink gym bag.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.320
This is Nike.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.160
I've had this for like

08:24.160 --> 08:25.000
seven years

08:25.000 --> 08:26.240
and it holds up really great.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.140
And a pink water bottle.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.720
No, this is not a Stanley.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.240
This is not a Hydro Flask.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.740
This is some knock off one I found at TJ Maxx.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.600
And I don't know,

08:36.600 --> 08:38.140
it's like my comfort water bottle.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.160
And one more tip I want to add

08:40.160 --> 08:42.520
is invest in good quality sports bras

08:42.520 --> 08:44.280
that hold yourself together

08:44.280 --> 08:46.280
and make you feel more comfortable

08:46.280 --> 08:48.660
when you're doing these different workouts in the gym.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.720
That's really gonna be a lifesaver,

08:50.720 --> 08:51.760
especially if you're running,

08:51.760 --> 08:53.940
jumping, or doing anything like that.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.080
So now I'm gonna show you guys a couple outfit ideas,

08:57.080 --> 08:58.680
and these are all Lululemon.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.880
I'm sorry these are not budget friendly.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.200
I haven't shopped at Lululemon in 3 years,

09:03.200 --> 09:05.280
so I don't know if this stuff's available,

09:05.280 --> 09:06.980
but I'm gonna show you anyways.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.600
So those are some tips

09:13.600 --> 09:16.580
for dressing and feeling more feminine in the gym.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.280
And if I can think of any more tips,

09:18.280 --> 09:19.900
I will make a part 2.

09:19.960 --> 09:20.600
But anyways,

09:20.600 --> 09:22.260
thanks for watching. Bye!
