00:00.040 --> 00:01.280
My sister and my niece

00:01.281 --> 00:04.081
Gogo are flying all the way over from Utah today

00:04.082 --> 00:06.121
and I know that they love chocolate muffins,

00:06.122 --> 00:08.961
so I decided to make them some before they arrive.

00:08.962 --> 00:10.801
I combined some all purpose flour,

00:10.802 --> 00:12.881
Dutch process cocoa, salt,

00:12.882 --> 00:13.281
sugar,

00:13.282 --> 00:16.841
and some chopped up chocolate before moving on to my wet ingredients,

00:16.842 --> 00:18.561
which are some eggs, milk,

00:18.562 --> 00:19.961
sour cream, olive oil,

00:19.962 --> 00:22.401
and some vanilla. I gave that a good whisk

00:22.402 --> 00:24.961
and then poured my wet ingredients into my dry.

00:24.962 --> 00:27.041
I made sure to not over mix it.

00:27.042 --> 00:28.481
As soon as it came together,

00:28.482 --> 00:30.361
I spooned it into my muffin tin

00:30.362 --> 00:32.501
that was lined with some Parchment paper.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.360
Top my muffins with more chocolate

00:34.361 --> 00:37.121
before popping them in the oven for about 15 minutes

00:37.122 --> 00:39.601
while I got started on my chocolate ganache.

00:39.602 --> 00:41.601
I heated up a smidge of heavy cream,

00:41.602 --> 00:43.241
chopped up some more milk chocolate

00:43.242 --> 00:45.841
before pouring the hot heavy cream over it.

00:45.842 --> 00:49.581
Let that sit for about two minutes before whisking it all together.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.400
Since I wanted to fill my muffins with my chocolate ganache,

00:52.401 --> 00:54.841
I transferred it over to a squeeze bottle,

00:54.842 --> 00:57.921
pulled my muffins out, let them cool for about 10 minutes,

00:57.922 --> 01:00.201
and then filled every single one of my muffins

01:00.202 --> 01:01.761
with that melted chocolate.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.121
In order to keep them fresh,

01:03.122 --> 01:05.481
I transferred them over to my dome cake plate

01:05.482 --> 01:07.341
and waited for them to arrive.
