00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I've had several people DM me lately

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.061
saying something along the lines of like,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.280
my ex is acting really acting fucking crazy lately or, gosh,

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:11.241
what is going on? They always act like this around Christmas time.

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:12.941
Like they're co parent, they're.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.640
Do, you know,

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:16.381
just the. The ugly ex that they don't like to deal with.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.420
That's what they do this time of year.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.420
They are unable to cope when they're not the center of attention.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.200
And the holidays are inherently a time of year

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:27.681
where they're not the center of attention.

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:30.541
They just can't be. There's so much fucking shit going on.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.000
There's concerts and school

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.681
and presents and wrapping and parties and this and that.

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:35.681
There's so much going on,

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:37.821
it's really hard to make them the center of attention.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.660
And they lose their ever loving fucking mind,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.220
throw little fits or find read they're sick

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.880
or they're having some major issue that needs to take precedence.

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:52.841
You know, something's happening at where there's just.

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:56.041
They find some way to make themselves the center of attention

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:57.501
because they cannot handle it.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.480
And unfortunately, the only way to do that around the holidays is to. It.

00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:04.941
It has gonna have to be fucking huge and fucking dramatic

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.280
and a big fucking deal. So if you're confused or if that's like

00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:13.701
what goes on in your life this time of year,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.100
that's why instead of continuing the cycle,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.120
it's maybe this could be the last year,

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:22.733
and then you Just break the cycle.
