00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.360
do your windows need to be cleaned

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:02.520
do your homeschool lessons on them

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.400
it'll force you to clean you're welcome for that cleaning hack

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:06.800
by the way we are doing our homeschool lessons way late today

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:08.720
because the kids spent the night at their grandparents house

00:00:08.721 --> 00:00:09.840
and didn't get home till lunch

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.560
well I just wouldn't even do lessons today

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.760
because my kids are typically in a bad mood when they get home

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:15.800
I'm trying to get out of the habit as kind these days is a loss

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.600
because they do spend a lot of time at their grandparents

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.480
and that just can't be an excuse to not get our score

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:21.680
so we're gonna get in a quick math and reading practice today

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:22.720
but I'm not gonna teach anything

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:23.640
I kept it super simple

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:27.140
we practice two digit edition with carrying over your regular words

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.440
we did some of our word cards and I did a read a lot

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:32.160
if you pay any attention to education and school related news

00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:33.960
you know that reading is a hot topic right now

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:35.720
because a lot of public schools are failing

00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:37.040
when it comes to teaching our kids how to read

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:37.880
and as a former teacher

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:40.800
I can tell you I was not properly trained to teach children how to read

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:42.920
I spent the last year doing courses and trainings

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:44.360
on how to teach my daughter how to read

00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.440
because she struggled so much through our kindergarten

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:50.000
I am a firm believer that kids are gonna read on their own timeline

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.000
you don't have to be reading at the end of kindergarten

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:53.160
however I do

00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:55.960
you know what is so so important to provide good reading instruct

00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:57.040
so let this be encouragement

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.800
that if your kindergarten or first grader isn't reading fluently

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:02.560
it's okay focus your attention on providing high quality

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:04.320
multi sensory reading instruction

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:05.560
and eventually they will get

00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:08.180
in the meantime fill your home with lots of colorful books

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.440
read a lot of read alouds

00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:11.038
and help them fall in love with learning
