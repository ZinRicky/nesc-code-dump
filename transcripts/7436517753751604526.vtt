My toddler woke up with a cough and a slight sore throat this morning

00:03.601 --> 00:04.841
and when I checked the fridge

00:04.842 --> 00:07.241
I realized we were all out of cough syrup,

00:07.242 --> 00:09.721
so it was definitely time for a restock.

00:09.722 --> 00:11.881
I started by peeling one lemon,

00:11.882 --> 00:14.361
moving on to peeling a good amount of ginger.

00:14.362 --> 00:16.281
I don't know what it is about peeling ginger,

00:16.282 --> 00:18.241
but it's always so hard for me.

00:18.242 --> 00:20.721
I poured some filtered water into my pot,

00:20.722 --> 00:23.121
added my ginger, my lemon peel,

00:23.122 --> 00:26.201
some fresh thyme, and also some lemon balm.

00:26.202 --> 00:28.501
I usually just eyeball the ingredients,

00:28.600 --> 00:31.640
put that on the stove to simmer for about 45 minutes

00:31.641 --> 00:32.921
and then turn the heat off

00:32.922 --> 00:36.641
and just let it cool down while I get started on mixing some honey

00:36.642 --> 00:38.881
and the juice of about two small lemons.

00:38.882 --> 00:42.201
Sometimes I do three. I squeeze them through a fine mesh strainer,

00:42.202 --> 00:45.041
making sure that I don't get any of the seeds in.

00:45.042 --> 00:47.681
My herbal mixture is warm and not hot anymore.

00:47.682 --> 00:49.161
I strain that as well,

00:49.162 --> 00:51.961
making sure to get every last drop before giving that

00:51.962 --> 00:54.321
a really good mix and we're all done.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.041
I usually store this in the fridge,

00:56.042 --> 00:58.461
especially during cold and flu season,

00:58.480 --> 01:00.999
and give them a few spoonfuls throughout the day.
