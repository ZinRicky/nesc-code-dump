00:00.080 --> 00:02.600
Someone please tell me why I woke up at 4 a m.

00:02.600 --> 00:04.440
And decided to make rice pudding

00:04.440 --> 00:06.000
when I had a flight to catch.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.700
Not even two hours later,

00:07.720 --> 00:10.400
I woke up craving this German breakfast merchandise.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.000
So I decided to make that right when I woke up,

00:14.000 --> 00:16.280
alongside a cup of peppermint tea.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.520
Today is travel day.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.620
I have a shoot in New York.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.160
He decided to tag along.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.080
So we're gonna have three days in New York.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.880
I'm really excited for that.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.240
I went back upstairs

00:26.240 --> 00:28.960
and ran the shower for lucky to get him out of bed.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.920
He was telling me about this crazy dream

00:30.920 --> 00:32.120
he had last night.

00:32.120 --> 00:34.200
Lately we've both had really vivid dreams.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.000
It's really weird

00:35.000 --> 00:36.660
cause usually I don't dream.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.880
I did my skincare and then my hair.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.480
I always leave my toiletries out

00:41.480 --> 00:43.080
cause I need them that same morning.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.300
So I packed those up really quick

00:45.400 --> 00:48.120
and then decided to get dressed in the morning.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.560
My brain doesn't work properly,

00:49.560 --> 00:51.680
so I lay my outfit out the night before

00:51.680 --> 00:54.240
and make sure that super warm and cozy.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.600
I walk downstairs because something was burning

00:56.600 --> 00:59.640
and I realized I burnt my rice pudding.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.080
So I never ate that.

01:01.080 --> 01:01.640
At this point,

01:01.640 --> 01:03.200
we were rushing to the airport

01:03.200 --> 01:05.580
and needed to check in our bag.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.360
Also, if you can get clear,

01:07.360 --> 01:10.520
it's so easy and quick to get through security.

01:10.520 --> 01:11.480
Highly recommend.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.320
We made it onto our plane and landed in New York

01:14.320 --> 01:15.560
three hours Later.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.200
It feels so good being back.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.000
I love the energy,

01:18.000 --> 01:19.040
the people, the walking,

01:19.040 --> 01:20.440
just everything about it.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.360
We decided to get ready really quick

01:22.360 --> 01:24.380
and then go have some lunch.
