00:00.240 --> 00:01.700
I am gonna try to link

00:01.960 --> 00:05.680
all the books that I have read on my Amazon storefront,

00:05.680 --> 00:06.820
the link in my bio.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.800
But let's just get started.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.200
All the, like,

00:09.200 --> 00:11.020
crunchy mom books that I recommend.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.800
How to heal your metabolism.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.180
I read this right before I got pregnant,

00:15.200 --> 00:17.520
and this is why I started my whole journey with,

00:17.520 --> 00:18.780
like, foods and,

00:19.240 --> 00:21.280
like, raw milk and all the stuff. Literally,

00:21.280 --> 00:24.280
this looks at the foundation for me on the what to eat.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.320
How to eat. This is amazing.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.500
So 10 out of ten.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.280
How does human your metabolism?

00:29.280 --> 00:30.660
By Kate Dearie.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.000
I read these two are pregnant. Um,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.580
be your child's pediatrician and be your own doctor.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.480
Um, both from the same.

00:38.480 --> 00:39.560
I think it's from the same.

00:39.560 --> 00:40.940
Yeah, the same author.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.360
Um, and I still go back to these for, like,

00:44.360 --> 00:45.580
home remedies

00:45.600 --> 00:46.480
anytime I have something.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.320
I go into this,

00:47.320 --> 00:48.240
these two books,

00:48.240 --> 00:50.260
whether for myself or for my daughter,

00:50.400 --> 00:52.220
and it's amazing.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.220
Also a lot of information on,

00:54.840 --> 00:58.000
you know what pokes that I want to say

00:58.000 --> 01:00.500
because I don't want to get censored, but, yeah,

01:00.840 --> 01:02.240
real food for pregnancy.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.020
I read this while I was pregnant.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.000
I agree with a lot of things in this book,

01:06.000 --> 01:07.820
but I don't agree with some things,

01:08.560 --> 01:10.580
so I give it, like, a.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.140
I got 8 out of 10.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.400
How smart is your baby?

01:13.400 --> 01:15.260
I also read this while pregnant.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.120
Um, it's just, like,

01:16.120 --> 01:16.840
really good for, like,

01:16.840 --> 01:17.760
learning on Like,

01:17.760 --> 01:19.160
baby development and, like,

01:19.160 --> 01:20.240
swear Learned, like,

01:20.240 --> 01:21.880
babies need to be on the floor a lot and,

01:21.880 --> 01:22.920
like, not in,

01:22.920 --> 01:23.760
like, you know,

01:23.760 --> 01:25.280
swings and all this stuff.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.560
So basically,

01:26.560 --> 01:27.680
this book is for that.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.120
The first 40 days.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.420
A crucial book

01:30.840 --> 01:31.600
full of, like,

01:31.600 --> 01:32.960
things for postpartum,

01:32.960 --> 01:34.300
for recipes,

01:34.400 --> 01:36.880
um, foods that you should be eating.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.680
Just, this book is amazing.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.280
I, I, I wish I would have applied more of this stuff,

01:41.280 --> 01:42.320
but next time around,

01:42.320 --> 01:43.920
I'm definitely gonna be rereading this

01:43.920 --> 01:45.240
and applying this,

01:45.240 --> 01:46.880
because it just,

01:46.880 --> 01:47.980
it makes sense.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.540
Anime's guide to childbirth.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.600
I get this, like,

01:51.600 --> 01:52.440
at 11 out of 10

01:52.440 --> 01:55.120
because so much information on,

01:55.120 --> 01:56.040
like, childbirth.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.040
If you're planning to, like,

01:57.040 --> 01:58.860
do an unmedicated birth,

01:58.960 --> 01:59.920
this is the book for you.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.680
And it's also on faith based,

02:01.680 --> 02:02.940
so I love that.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.840
The Mama Natural Pregnancy and childbirth, um,

02:05.840 --> 02:07.860
guide to pregnancy and childbirth book.

02:08.640 --> 02:09.440
It was good,

02:09.440 --> 02:10.880
but I wouldn't repurchase

02:10.880 --> 02:12.200
because I don't agree with a lot of,

02:12.200 --> 02:13.080
like, I mean,

02:13.080 --> 02:14.120
I agree with some things,

02:14.120 --> 02:15.680
but not a lot of, like,

02:15.680 --> 02:17.980
the foods and stuff that she recommends.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.200
Um, it's, like,

02:19.200 --> 02:20.280
a little bit more traditional.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.600
So, yeah, like

02:21.600 --> 02:22.620
a 7 out of 10.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.140
This book, Safe Infant Sleep.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.560
I read this while pregnant,

02:26.560 --> 02:28.400
and it's just basically, like,

02:28.400 --> 02:30.320
all the information on co sleeping.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.200
If you're, like,

02:31.200 --> 02:33.420
you know, kind of on defense on it,

02:33.560 --> 02:34.880
this book is really good for,

02:34.880 --> 02:36.060
to make your decision.

02:36.080 --> 02:36.980
And it just.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.160
Nick Shows you,

02:38.160 --> 02:40.220
you know, the safeways and all that stuff.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.380
How to raise a healthy child in spite of your doctor.

02:43.720 --> 02:47.780
Love, love, love this doctor. Robert mon.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.560
I don't know how to say his last name, but he.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.520
This book is amazing.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.360
I actually read this right before I found that I

02:53.360 --> 02:54.080
was pregnant, so I.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.820
This book holds a lot of, like,

02:56.280 --> 02:59.180
memories for me, but, again,

02:59.520 --> 03:00.120
speaks a lot,

03:00.120 --> 03:01.880
unlike pokes,

03:01.880 --> 03:03.260
if you know what I'm talking about.

03:03.840 --> 03:04.960
And, like, childhood stuff

03:04.960 --> 03:06.540
and diseases and stuff and.

03:06.760 --> 03:07.700
Really good book,

03:08.280 --> 03:11.100
this one. The Womanly Art of breastfeeding.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.080
You need to get it if you're planning on breastfeeding,

03:13.080 --> 03:17.320
because I Learned most breastfeeding stuff in this book.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.000
I'm 19 months into my journey,

03:19.000 --> 03:20.120
and I still go back to this book,

03:20.120 --> 03:21.600
like, for weaning and stuff.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.260
I've been going back to this book,

03:23.280 --> 03:26.140
so I really recommend this book. Like,

03:26.320 --> 03:27.440

03:27.440 --> 03:28.520
Your guide. Like,

03:28.520 --> 03:29.680

03:29.680 --> 03:31.280
Like, I read it while I was pregnant,

03:31.280 --> 03:32.160
and then postpartum,

03:32.160 --> 03:33.180
I reread it.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.080
I still go back to it.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.500
Like, it's gold.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.800
And this one,

03:36.800 --> 03:37.800
functional maternity.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.240
Actually just finished reading this one.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.680
I wish I would have read this

03:40.680 --> 03:42.160
before I got pregnant with my daughter,

03:42.160 --> 03:43.180
but that's okay.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.240
Um, and this is just all the information on, like,

03:46.240 --> 03:47.360
things that you need to be doing,

03:47.360 --> 03:48.720
preconception,

03:48.720 --> 03:50.400
the foods that you need to be eating,

03:50.400 --> 03:51.820
how to prevent, like,

03:51.840 --> 03:52.600
things that happen.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.320
During labor.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.640
Like it. It 10 out of 10.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.440
Recommend this book

03:56.440 --> 03:57.780
if you can read it

03:57.800 --> 03:58.880
either while you're pregnant

03:58.880 --> 04:00.440
or before you get pregnant.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.400
I really recommend.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.760

04:02.760 --> 04:05.893
Try to link all these in my Amazon storefront, but yeah.
