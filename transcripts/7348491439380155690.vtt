00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.800
okay we gotta sit down for this one

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a mom of three kids

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.000
please excuse my appearance

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:05.040
I just got home from the gym

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.400
I always knew I wanted to be a mom

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:10.320
but I talk a lot on here about my support of the child free people

00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:12.660
okay because this is not for everyone

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.840
and I was scrolling the little ticky tacky as you do

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:16.920
and I came across this video and oh my god

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:19.000
you have to see this because honestly

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:19.800
watch that

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.460
it's a stitch

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.260
mostly for a woman

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.120
with all due respect

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:28.680
enjoy your selfish self centered self serving life

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:32.320
and enjoy always taking the easy way out and doing everything the easy way

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:37.060
never doing anything difficult or meaningful or rewarding or anything worthwhile

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.940
and enjoy dying alone

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.720
the hardest things in life will always be the most worthwhile

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:43.760
so if you're that weak

00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:45.440
it's probably better that you don't have kids

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:46.280
and by the way

00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:47.600
there are a lot better countries

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:48.400
living in Mexico

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:50.700
Mexico's gross and dirty yuck

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.120
and it's a good thing you're smoking hot

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:54.420
but you're gonna get old

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.760
that too okay

00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:58.880
so all the offensive things in one video right

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:01.840
like and just sprinkle a little racism in there too xenophobia

00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:02.360
why not

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:06.600
that was one of the most horrific takes from actual parents I've ever seen

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:07.660
and I'm a parent

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.060
but wait it gets better

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.140
this is the same guy

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.960
but I just can't believe that a few like

00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:16.800
several years ago

00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:19.000
I was on the fence whether I wanted kids or not

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:19.520
or I thought well

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:20.920
they were never gonna want kids

00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:21.440
but like

00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:23.160
I married you and you want kids

00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:24.920
so I guess I'll agree to have kids

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:25.760
but it's gonna be tough

00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:26.520
it's a lot of work

00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:27.760
whatever literal

00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:28.800
same words to me

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:30.720
I just would never have kids because

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.760
because then your life's not your own anymore

00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:33.960
and you're all about your kids

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:34.720
you're not about you

00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:36.780
you can't do what you want when you want

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.520
you know kids

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:39.200
it's a it's a big commitment

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:40.320
it's a lot of work

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:40.800
like she said

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:41.600
it's worth it

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.840
and like you know

00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:45.640
even the the studies in the stats about like

00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:47.840
parents with kids are like

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.960
they have more problems

00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:50.320
they're more prone to divorce

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:52.640
they're more likely to be depressed

00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:53.640
and I just thought like well

00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:54.820
you know the irony

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.080
the data has spoken

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.540
we probably shouldn't have kids

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.400
I just can't believe now that we have her and she's like

00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:01.480
two and a half years old

00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:08.080
that I ever would have thought that I wouldn't have wanted a kid because huh

00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:09.240
she's amazing

00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:10.240
yeah awesome

00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:12.820
and she's she's beautiful

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.000
and she's and she's

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.940
I'm so glad you love your own child

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.480
she's she's out there

00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:19.840
she has a ton of energy

00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:23.020
she's a lot she's super hard to keep up with

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.520
she's super hard to like

00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:27.380
you know to manage and to stay on top of

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.680
she doesn't sleep through the night

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.680
she gets in bed with us

00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:30.760
she keeps us awake

00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:31.620
but like

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.480
but she is my favourite thing in the entire world

00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:36.080
that's amazing

00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:41.060
she's she's kind for you and she's sweet and she's brilliant

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.080
and she's got this amazing personality and like

00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:47.800
and she's mine and I see like myself in her

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:50.560
in the things that she likes and says and does in her

00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:51.240
yeah it's great

00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:52.160
being a parent is great

00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:55.820
so anyone who has kids can relate to the second part of the video

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.140
but it blows my fucking mind

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.920
that that guy had all the same arguments

00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:03.920
and self thoughts about not having children

00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:08.320
and then goes on to shame a woman for having those same thoughts

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:13.580
and coming to a different conclusion for her life and her happiness

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.100
how fucking gross

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.720
I don't say this a lot

00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:20.300
but shame on you shame on you
