00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.560
I only stopped binging when I started eating intuitively

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:05.040
and I stopped dieting

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.680
I know this is a troll comment because she stays in my comments

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:11.260
however I think this is a really good opportunity to talk about how

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.640
binge eating is often the result of restriction right

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:15.400
at least for me

00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:17.480
because I grew up a

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:18.400
a fat kid like

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:19.560
I've always been fat

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.320
I have been on diet since

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.960
you know I was a child

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:25.880
I honestly don't remember a time before I was dieting and constantly

00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:27.200
like worrying about my weight

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:28.200
and because I grew up fat

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:30.880
I was constantly worried about becoming bigger

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:32.080
I grew up yo yo

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.240
dieting and like

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:36.720
in the cycle of restriction and binging and restriction and binging

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.740
and being forced on these diets as a child

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.360
messed up my relationship with food to a degree that I'm like

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:43.480
I'm still recovering from

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.000
I have a big sweet tooth and like sweets were

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.400
such a no no growing up

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:49.120
um and whenever I would get my hands on like

00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:50.280
chocolate or whatever

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.080
instead of just like

00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:54.100
having a piece because I was craving it and then like

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.120
leaving it for later

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:58.520
I would eat the entire thing because I knew I wasn't supposed to have it

00:00:58.521 --> 00:00:59.960
I didn't know if it would be taken away from me

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:00.800
like I

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.040
I knew it was like

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.740
you know fleeting right

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.720
and so I would binge on that thing just

00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.480
like having a piece and then moving on

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:11.240
I felt so much shame around the food that I was eating that like

00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:13.440
I just like wanted to have it and then I didn't wanna think about it

00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:15.840
and like that was one of the things that caused me to binge

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:18.320
and then when I started being in charge of the food that I ate

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:19.960
being control of the groceries that I bought

00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:21.660
when I ate what I ate whatever

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.340
I switched from like

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.200
binging to eating what my body wanted

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.520
and not restricting the foods that I wanted to eat

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:33.600
which in turn caused me to have a better relationship with food

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:36.579
because I didn't eat from this position of like restriction 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.160
because of my cycle of yo-yo dieting in my childhood

00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:41.840
I was continuously losing and gaining weight all the time

00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:44.960
and that is what caused the weight gain that I had throughout my life

00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:49.440
when I stopped dieting and I stopped restricting myself and started eating just

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.520
what I wanted

00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:52.640
that is when my weight maintained

00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:54.040
since I started eating intuitively

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:57.380
this is the first time in my entire life that my weight is the same

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.440
and you don't have to believe me

00:01:58.441 --> 00:01:59.800
like I I'm

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:00.880
what do I gain from lying though

00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:02.000
like this is

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:02.920
this is my reality

00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:04.140
this is what happened in my life

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.240
I'm not denying like

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:06.000
I did binge eat

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.240
that was something that I definitely

00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:08.120
definitely did

00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:10.000
and I don't really anymore

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.840
intuitive eating is what has helped me with that

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:13.480
that being said

00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:16.300
I think it's really interesting the way that people talk about

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.540
eating disorders that result in like

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.680
weight gain versus eating disorders that

00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:22.600
like make people look emaciated

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:25.598
y'all's lack of empathy for fat people is very telling of your character
