I'm a homemaker with a chronic illness,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.200
and I get asked a lot of times how I

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.980
managed to keep up with everything around my house

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.300
while I'm struggling with chronic illness.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.340
This is one of my favorite tips.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.920
When I cook,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.100
I cook a lot of food.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.360
I basically cook in bulk,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.780
and then we eat on it for a few days,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080
because I will often have one good day

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.380
and then a few bad days,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.440
so this saves me a lot of energy.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.620
And then also,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.520
um, once the food is cool,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.380
I can freeze it and pull that out of the freezer later.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.260
So I just try to keep stuff like this on hand. Um,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.860
but bolt cooking is definitely one of my favorite tips.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.380
Tonight I made a pot of cheeseburger soup,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.680
and I should have enough leftovers to get us through

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.400
at least the next day,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.765
maybe the day after that.
