00:00.080 --> 00:02.800
My parents are on a 10 hour flight over from Germany

00:02.801 --> 00:03.961
and they're about to land,

00:03.962 --> 00:06.201
so I decided to make them an early dinner

00:06.202 --> 00:08.121
for when they arrive at our house.

00:08.122 --> 00:10.441
Our friends brought us these potatoes from Idaho,

00:10.442 --> 00:14.121
so I thought it would be perfect making a duck fat roasted potato.

00:14.122 --> 00:16.361
I started by chopping them and boiling them

00:16.362 --> 00:19.221
while I got started on my maple roasted carrots.

00:19.240 --> 00:22.920
I cut my rainbow carrots in half and seasoned them with some olive oil,

00:22.921 --> 00:25.181
maple syrup, and some other spices.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.520
This point my potatoes were parboiled.

00:27.521 --> 00:28.401
I shook them up

00:28.402 --> 00:31.761
and transfer them over to a baking sheet with some hot duck fat

00:31.762 --> 00:34.401
before roasting them for about an hour in the oven.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.041
In the meantime,

00:35.042 --> 00:37.801
I got started on making a cilantro hummus

00:37.802 --> 00:40.441
and plated that before popping that in the fridge.

00:40.442 --> 00:41.681
Once that was set aside,

00:41.682 --> 00:46.281
I made my variation of a gremolata and added some green olives,

00:46.282 --> 00:49.221
dill, parsley, and also a red plum.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.680
Finally chopped my parsley and my dough

00:51.681 --> 00:54.961
before moving on to my olives and adding them to the plate.

00:54.962 --> 00:55.881
Last but not least,

00:55.882 --> 00:59.481
I also cut up my and added some olive oil,

00:59.482 --> 01:02.721
lemon juice, and some grated garlic to the mix.

01:02.722 --> 01:05.401
Seasoned with salt and pepper. Gave that a good stir.

01:05.402 --> 01:08.441
By this point my fish was ready to go in the oven,

01:08.442 --> 01:10.521
so I got started on the marinade,

01:10.522 --> 01:12.361
which was just some melted butter,

01:12.362 --> 01:16.481
some lemon juice, and a handful Of other spices to go with the fish.

01:16.482 --> 01:19.761
Coated my fish in the marinade before putting it on a baking sheet

01:19.762 --> 01:22.741
and adding some tomatoes to roast as well.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.280
This point, I was ready to plate,

01:24.281 --> 01:28.241
so I put my maple roasted carrots down on my cilantro hummus,

01:28.242 --> 01:30.681
topped my fish with some of the granola,

01:30.682 --> 01:32.881
but also put some extra on the side,

01:32.882 --> 01:34.641
plated my potatoes as well,

01:34.642 --> 01:35.921
and there we go.

01:35.922 --> 01:37.041
Dinner was served.

01:37.042 --> 01:38.721
My dad loves a good potato,

01:38.722 --> 01:40.921
while my mom loves a well cooked fish,

01:40.922 --> 01:42.741
so this was perfect.
