00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
On the Friday that just passed,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.420
a young beautiful 23 year old teachers aid was killed,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.700
murdered by her ex partner,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.600
a man. Eighteen Australian women have died from gender based finance

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:23.601
this year alone. It's surpassing our usual average of one per week,

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:25.481
which is still not good enough.

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:28.321
And for all my US followers,

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:30.201
Australia's not that big. So proportionally,

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:31.921
that's still a lot. Yeah.

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:36.081
And so I've been having a lot of conversations about this.

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:41.821
And one of the trends that experts are noticing

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.080
is that violence against women,

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:48.101
men's violence against women is not getting better.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.000
We've got all these awareness,

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:51.621
we've got all these services.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.160
We've just come along way in so many ways.

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:55.841
And yet, so

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:57.741
why are the statistics

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.200
not showing us the results that we'd be expecting

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:04.121
potentially to see by now?

00:01:04.122 --> 00:01:07.501
In fact, it seems to be getting somewhat worse

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.980
as women of all ages become more empowered.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.480
The reaction against that by some men is proportionate to that.

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:22.161
Women in their 50s are leaving their husbands

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:24.401
because they've just figured out

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:26.301
I don't have to do this anymore.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.200
I actually could go off and live a better life without this,

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:32.441
with this abusive relationship.

00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:37.441
Gen Z women have grown up in this feminist environment basically

00:01:37.442 --> 00:01:38.721
where they've got the world at their fingertips,

00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:42.421
like all this information and they're standing up for what they want.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.880
They feel empowered to lead a different life

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:46.961
to the life of their parents

00:01:46.962 --> 00:01:49.721
and Grandparents, men are being left behind.

00:01:49.722 --> 00:01:52.281
They're not catching up to that.

00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:55.761
They still have been born into this entitlement,

00:01:55.762 --> 00:01:58.401
that they feel entitlement over a lot of things,

00:01:58.402 --> 00:01:59.601
including women in our body.

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:01.761
And they're still stuck in the man box

00:02:01.762 --> 00:02:02.321
whereby

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:06.701
they don't know how to process their emotions in a healthy way.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.380
They feel entitled over women.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.480
And when women reject them,

00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:14.681
which women are doing increasingly,

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:18.181
or they feel like they don't have full control over women,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.940
which is happening more and more,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.720
they are still reacting in the same ways that they always have.

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:26.121
So when men say, no,

00:02:26.122 --> 00:02:28.241
for real, we've grown to hate you,

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:31.081
it isn't the patriarchy. It's what's become of you.

00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:33.881
I don't see that as something to laugh about.

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:36.681
I see that as a very real problem

00:02:36.682 --> 00:02:41.261
that results in the deaths of real women.
