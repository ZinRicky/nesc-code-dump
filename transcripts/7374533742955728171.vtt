00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.800
a few weeks ago

00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:01.600
I posted a video

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:03.400
talking about how I was so thankful

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:06.200
that I don't have to wear a Jean skirt when I play sports anymore

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:08.760
and the comments were absolutely bizarre

00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:12.600
so many people related to what I had to say and then others were very offended

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.240
something that I talk about a lot on my page

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:17.640
is how much my life has drastically changed since I left legalism

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:19.600
and have built a real relationship with Jesus

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:21.040
if you were up in legalism

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.280
a high control group or maybe even a cult

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.360
I'm sure you can relate

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:28.200
your perspective on life when you're in something like that is just so small

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:30.100
your world is so small

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.000
you've been taught to believe a certain set of beliefs and that's it

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.480
and you're expected to follow those beliefs or standards without question

00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:40.320
for me it's been a lot of asking myself okay

00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:41.720
is this what scripture teaches

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:44.000
or is this what I was taught to believe by man

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:47.140
I want to honour and please the Lord in everything that I do

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.880
not because a man told me to

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.600
but because that's what actually glorifies the Lord

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.560
this affects every area of my life

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:55.160
including my job

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:57.320
my marriage my friendships

00:00:57.321 --> 00:00:58.500
all of my relationship

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.640
and yes even the clothes that I wear

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:03.960
if you're working through something similar or you can relate to this at all

00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:06.360
I just want to encourage you that you're not alone

00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:07.580
you're not crazy

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.920
give yourself time

00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:10.160
give yourself Grace

00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:10.920
god is good

00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:13.598
you can walk out of this and still have a great relationship with Jesus
