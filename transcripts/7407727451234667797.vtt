00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.800
bedtime will forever be my favourite time of the day

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.502
but I still have a few more things to get 

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:05.800
through before I can finally say

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:07.280
that's enough todaying for today

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:09.280
and after what's already been quite a long day

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:11.048
I gave my husband a look that said 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.694
tag you're it 

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:13.680
and took myself off to an evening yoga class

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:15.320
and normally by the time I make it to class

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:17.600
it's already dark but tonight it was still light out

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.200
which means summer is on its way

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.200
and that just makes my little soul so happy

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:22.280
cause I don't know about you

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:24.302
but I'm ready to shake off the winter blues

00:00:24.303 --> 00:00:25.257
 and soak up some D

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:26.161
 vitamin d of course 

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.960
my husband made the kids some spaghetti Bolognese while I was out

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.640
but because I'm just so delusionally ready for some warmer weather

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:33.240
I'm gonna eat like it's already here

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.480
and all day I've been craving a really big chicken salad

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:36.860
so that's what we're having

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.680
But if you were to ask me where I was at mentally

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:40.560
I'm deep in a court of silver flames

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:42.880
and I'm just counting down the minutes before I can read it

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:45.360
although I won't lie I was close to crying with joy tasting this

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.120
because it was everything I needed it to be 

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:47.791
And so much more

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:50.560
 I need to know who else can't go to bed without cleaning up first

00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:51.880
because no matter how tired I am

00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:53.120
I will always force myself

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:55.520
to do a quick whip around the house before I stop for the day

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.320
I find I wake up in a much better head space

00:00:57.321 --> 00:00:58.920
and feel like I'm gonna be more productive

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:00.880
if my house is at least a little bit reset 

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:02.931
I can't do any vacuuming cause markâ€™s in the other room 

00:01:02.932 --> 00:01:03.920
tryna get the kids to sleep

00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:05.240
and alsoâ€¦ I don't really want to

00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:06.520
I'm powering through this last part

00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:07.489
but the end is in sight

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.680
 but one thing I would take every night without fail

00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:11.160
is my HeadRest from BraveFace

00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:12.400
because honestly if I don't

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:14.680
I am tossing and turning and overthinking all night

00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:16.360
They use chamomile and passionflower

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:18.440
for the perfect combination to help me get to sleep

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:19.320
and stay asleep

00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:21.423
and I've been taking it for almost two years 

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:22.605
and I genuinely swear by it
