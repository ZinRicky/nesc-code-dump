00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
controversial opinion you should be nice to people

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.240
this idea that no one owes anyone anything

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:05.080
I think is bullshit

00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:05.840
because quite literally

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:09.440
the only thing that we have in this world is connection with other human beings

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:09.840
and like

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.920
that's it so I think actually you do

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:13.040
you do owe people kindness

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.600
you do owe people human decency

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:18.200
like that that's literally all that you need to do in this world

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:21.800
I feel like we've been so desensitized as human beings and we become like

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:23.720
so isolated and alone

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:28.720
that we forget that human connection is literally the basis of human existence

00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:30.560
like just be fucking nice to people

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:31.320
it's real like

00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:34.040
I just I don't know why that is such a difficult concept

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:38.360
like why do we go out of our way to be cruel to people

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:41.820
do we go out of our way to judge others is like I

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.640
does it benefit your life to make you feel better

00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.780
because being a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.720
does it does being a hater like

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:49.000
make you feel better about yourself

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.720
I literally don't get it

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:52.700
because I have never had the urge

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.240
to comment something nasty on someone's profile

00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:57.560
I've never had the urge to like

00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:58.800
be mean to someone's face

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:00.240
like I don't understand that

00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:04.680
life is so much better when we are kind to people around us and we like

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:06.040
connect with other human being

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:08.620
do you not feel empty inside

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.600
like if your entire life is based on judging other people

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:17.480
like the only explanation I have is like you hate yourself

00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:19.060
that's the only thing that makes sense

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.900
and does that not make you hate yourself more

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.760
and if you are a person that hates on other that leaves nasty comments

00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:29.280
I really implore you take the week

00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.640
take the day take

00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:33.480
take the day maybe the week and just like be better

00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:35.080
be kinder be nicer

00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:36.880
when you have a negative thought and wanna voice that

00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:39.160
actually take a pause and do the opposite

00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:39.666
say something nice

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:41.046
I'm not kidding

00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:42.367
choose to be kind

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.467
choose to be good to people around you

00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:46.827
and you might just have some value in your life now

00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:50.027
because I'm so tired of people just being miserable

00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:56.067
and then continuing and perpetuating that misery onto the rest of the world

00:01:56.068 --> 00:02:00.199
take this opportunity to change that cycle and be better
