00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.400
What does big back mean? Quickly?

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:04.321
Where does that come from? Quickly?

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:07.281
Y'all don't even understand that that phobia in the words you use.

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:08.361
Big back has nothing to do with that.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.321
It is literally big back.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:11.481
Big, big is the problem.

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:12.281
Are y'all dumb?

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:13.041
Like, actually.

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.546
And they're making factors out of pillow shits. Fat phobic.
