00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.840
Okay, so at the outside

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.720
I'm not necessarily responding to this person

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.000
or this comment.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.880
I typically don't

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.720
for two reasons. One,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.480
the vast majority of Americans support abortion access.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.440
I don't need to convert anybody,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.780
so it's just generally not worth my time.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.360
2. It's also not worth my time to

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.520
engage with these male like,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.620
thoughtless

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.840
allegations that aren't grounded in either policy

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.720
or women's experiences

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.920
and are basically just an attempt to shame women for

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.020
what is largely men's irresponsible ejaculations.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.040
I did come on here to say though,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.120
but it always dumbfounds me how like

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.120
men across the world

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.940
commit approximately 80% of all violent crime.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.920
Depending on the location of the type of crime,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.240
that number can be a lot higher.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.960
So for example,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.040
in the United States,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.820
98% of all mass shooters are men.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.760
So for starters,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.360
it seems likely that if men could get pregnant

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.380
that they literally would have abortions for fun.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.200
Like they accuse women of doing that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.900
even though there's no research to support it.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.600
Um, but like,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.920
they kill alive

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.840
independent people for fun.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.300
Like a lot women

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.780
pregnant women.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.220
So despite that reality

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.600
and the fact that zero of them have

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.400
any first hand experience with abortion,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.700
none of them have ever needed one,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.680
they still think

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.700
that they get to label what an abortion is and is not.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.680
It's such a sad, pathetic.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.520
And ability to decenter yourself

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.400
and acknowledge that you like

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.800
obviously as a fact

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.313
don't Know what you're talking about
