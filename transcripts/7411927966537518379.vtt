00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.160
People don't actually understand that if you stop giving a single F

00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:05.480
your life gets so much better

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:07.680
7 reasons you should stop giving a fuck

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:10.160
number 1 we really don't live that long

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:12.520
so you might as well enjoy your life while you live it

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:13.920
we won't be around forever

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.880
so none of this is gonna matter anyways

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.960
care about your legacy and the way you live life

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:19.840
but truly none of it matters

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:23.160
the only thing that truly matters is the way you live your life every day.

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.600
Are you honorable, respectful, truthful?

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:28.700
Do people love you and do you love the people around you?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.920
number two why you should stop giving a

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:33.120
nobody thinks about you as much as you do

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:35.080
most people are so consumed with themselves

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:39.220
that they don't really think about you as much as you probably think they do

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.460
They don't really care.. so why should you?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.560
number 3 everything that you learn from life is from making mistakes.

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.320
Everything you became good at

00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:48.572
you were once bad at 

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:50.600
So why worry about making mistakes?

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:53.200
number 4. If you wouldn't take advice from them..

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:55.000
why are you listening to their criticism?

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:57.480
We hold on to words that other people say

00:00:57.481 --> 00:00:59.340
But do we really care about them?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.420
You probably shouldn't.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.160
No. 5  99% of your regrets are the things that you choose to not do.

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:08.560
Risk you don't take, things you don't say

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:09.851
Things you didn't do.

00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:11.880
So stop being afraid to take risk

00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:13.640
if you don't wanna have any regrets.

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:17.120
number 6 and I know this one is a hard one for most people

00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:19.260
but if you cannot control it

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.070
let it go 

00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:21.480
it does not serve you

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.200
stop caring literally

00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:24.304
say F it 

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:29.600
Lastly, the most important things in life are achieved not by caring more

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:30.880
but by caring less.

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:34.640
Wishing you were more of something actually makes you less of that.

00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:39.100
For example, wishing you were happy actually makes you unhappy

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.040
Essentially just stop giving a f about anything and start living your life happily 

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:46.920
Because truly none of this matters

00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:51.640
all the minute details that you're stressing and worrying about do NOT matter

00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:52.623
Just be happy.
