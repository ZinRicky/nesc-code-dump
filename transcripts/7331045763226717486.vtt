00:00.080 --> 00:02.400
So there's this little marriage hack I've Learned

00:02.400 --> 00:03.680
after being married for,

00:03.680 --> 00:04.560
like, nine years,

00:04.560 --> 00:05.700
and it is this,

00:05.760 --> 00:07.960
let your man be your hero.

00:07.960 --> 00:10.080
I know you were born into the society

00:10.080 --> 00:12.080
where we praise boss babes

00:12.080 --> 00:13.800
and being independent and empowered,

00:13.800 --> 00:15.360
but let that go.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.600
Let that go for a little bit

00:16.600 --> 00:18.040
and see how it makes you feel.

00:18.040 --> 00:19.880
You don't have to be in charge of everything.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.120
You don't have to be in control of everything.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.240
You can just let him do things. It's like,

00:24.240 --> 00:27.640
sometimes we feel like we have to do everything,

00:27.640 --> 00:29.940
and we feel like we have to be in control.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.160
And if you're married to a man who is, like,

00:32.160 --> 00:33.380
basically good,

00:33.720 --> 00:35.000
you don't have to be like that.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.560
It is so freeing to let go of that

00:37.560 --> 00:38.600
and to just

00:38.600 --> 00:40.580
sit back and watch your man do something for you.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.460
Just let him.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.320
It's so fun.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.840
It's like, it's hard for me to just, like,

00:43.840 --> 00:44.600
sit back sometimes

00:44.600 --> 00:45.520
because I feel bad.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.200
I feel like, oh,

00:46.200 --> 00:47.320
I need to help out with our.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.440
I need to do something, or, like,

00:48.440 --> 00:49.640
I'm sorry that you did that,

00:49.640 --> 00:51.200
or, like, a love to do things like that.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.840
There is not a married man out there

00:52.840 --> 00:54.860
who doesn't want to be his wife's hero.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.000
It doesn't exist.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.880
It's in their blood.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.000
It's in their DNA.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.360
To want to help you

00:59.360 --> 01:00.600
and to want to serve you,

01:00.600 --> 01:02.000
to want to be your hero.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.040
And it's in Your blood to receive

01:04.040 --> 01:05.540
and to be taken care of,

01:05.720 --> 01:06.693
let it happen
