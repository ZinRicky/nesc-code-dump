00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.400
I ended the day looking like this

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.915
but I'm only telling you that cause 

00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:03.336
Jump scare 

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:04.600
for the entirety of this video

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:05.960
I look like absolute shit

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:06.800
but we're heading out later

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:08.876
which means that my in laws are currently on their way 

00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:09.480
cause bless them

00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:11.001
they kindly volunteered to babysit 

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.480
and I wanna get the pins out later

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:14.131
so I'm marinating in fake tan and it's 

00:00:14.132 --> 00:00:15.360
a different brand to my usual

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:15.960
and I'll tell you

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:17.139
the developer is intense 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.988
and I have such a 

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:19.640
small window to sort this house out

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:20.960
but I work well under pressure

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:22.915
and nothing will motivate me quite like the 

00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:24.160
threat of people coming over

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:25.886
my husband always teases me cleaning like 

00:00:25.887 --> 00:00:27.160
this whenever we need to go out

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.360
he doesn't see the point because I don't get to enjoy it

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.520
and it'll probably be messy by the time we get back

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.200
but I think that 

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.256
“setting the vibes” needs to be formally recognised 

00:00:34.257 --> 00:00:35.440
as an official love language

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:36.979
because I know exactly what needs to be 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.480
done to this house to make it feel good

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:40.240
and if it feels good when my in laws walk in

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:41.968
then they'll feel good and if they feel good 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.120
here while they're babysitting

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:44.880
then maybe they wanna come back and do it again

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:46.080
do you see where I'm going with this

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:47.811
and also even though we've been married 

00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:48.720
coming up to 13 years

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:49.560
horrific I know

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:52.440
I still want them to think that their boy is in good hands okay

00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:54.720
although I do believe that they've discovered my TikTok now

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.960
so they probably already know that I'm actually insane

00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:57.640
but my final

00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:59.444
and probably most compelling argument to 

00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:00.720
cleaning before you go out is

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:03.434
you do not wanna wake up dusty, in a filthy house 

00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:05.052
anyway you know how we’re heavily focused 

00:01:05.053 --> 00:01:06.440
on our pool renovation at the moment

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.000
every minute of sunshine we get we're spending outside

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.720
but the weather where I live is about as Moody as I am

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:13.680
we honestly get four seasons in one day

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.312
but today we're just getting one season

00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:16.400
 and it's the rainy season

00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:18.360
so it's actually the perfect time to clean my house

00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:20.040
I kinda due an inside day cause I've been 

00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:21.440
working my fkn ass off out there

00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:23.960
and just kind of ignoring everything else that goes on inside

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:24.600
including the washing

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:27.680
which is been really piling up and took me a significant amount of time

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:30.000
but we're just gonna chuck Netflix on and power through it

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.320
And this… I'm kind of embarrassed about this

00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:31.920
but I tell you what

00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:34.600
my beautiful little girl is definitely the messiest of all of us

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:36.520
I can just about guarantee you when I wake up tomorrow

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:38.080
those toys will be everywhere again

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:40.133
But it's okay cause I tried my best and for at 

00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:41.400
least one moment it was clean

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:42.640
I do need to renovate that room

00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:43.437
but not right now 

00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:45.031
right now I need to renovate myself 

00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:45.918
and head to coldplay
