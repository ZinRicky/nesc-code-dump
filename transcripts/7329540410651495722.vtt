00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.680
My youngest baby is two,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.040
and I am just now feeling like my body is my own again.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.160
And as a third time mom,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.400
I really thought I knew what to expect,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.400
especially when it came to postpartum recovery.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.040
I give myself a lot of Grace and a lot of patience,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.960
but even then,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.640
even with going back and working out,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.780
even with, like,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.480
trying to take care of myself,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.960
it still has taken two years

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.600
for me to even feel remotely back to the starting point

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.880
I was before I had this third baby.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.840
I don't know if it was the fact that this is my third,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.600
if the fact that I'm in my mid 30s,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.880
or if I just have a lot more going on

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.800
than I did when I had my first two kids.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.920
Like, health and fitness kind of went on the back burner

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.720
for a little while.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.040
The fact that we tell women

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.320
that postpartum is one year is insane,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.520
because I have never felt recovered from a pregnancy

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.400
one year out.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.880
So if you are still struggling with feeling like

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.620
your body is still kind of a foreign object to you,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.600
just know to give yourself until the two year Mark

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.000
and then reevaluate.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400
Every postpartum is different,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.289
and everybody's body is different.
