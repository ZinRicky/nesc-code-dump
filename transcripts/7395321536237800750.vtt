00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.840
So one of the arguments in the manosphere

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:04.641
is that women have much higher expectations for men

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:08.041
than men do for women. We think that men want the boss, babe,

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:09.161
and they want us to pay bills

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:10.801
and they want us to cook and clean and have kids,

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:12.881
when in reality, that's not what they actually want.

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:15.401
Men have become discouraged within the dating realm,

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:19.601
rightfully so, because they seem to be viewed as a walking,

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:23.201
talking checklist. And nobody discusses this walking checklist

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:24.961
that men have to live up to

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:27.521
better than Gerard Butler and the Ugly Truth.

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:31.201
Women would have us believe that they are the victims,

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:33.541
that we break their hearts for sport.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.520
They say they want true love,

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.941
but all they want is a checklist.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.480
Is he perfect? Is he handsome?

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.161
Is he a doctor? For you,

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.881
men who fit the criteria, don't get yourselves,

00:00:44.882 --> 00:00:46.601
cause they're not sleeping with you.

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:51.241
They're sleeping with a carefully calculated set of venal choices.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:54.621
Money over substance, looks over soul,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.680
polish over principles. No gesture,

00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:59.721
no matter how real or romantic,

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:03.768
will ever compensate for a really impressive list of credentials.
