00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.640
Okay, so

00:00:00.641 --> 00:00:02.921
the one weird thing about my kitchen is

00:00:02.922 --> 00:00:05.001
there's no actual overhead light.

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:08.801
That's a really crappy one that I bought from Amazon that you have to,

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:10.161
like, plug in and then LCD,

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:15.201
and I fucking hate it. So the solution I got are these little things,

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:18.501
because this is the darkest little corner,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.720
so I got these things and I just stuck them under here.

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:27.781
They just clip on like that

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.100
and they turn on. I don't really give a shit that their motion sensor.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.780
I just wanna be able to see in my goddamn kitchen.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.380
And so then they just snap in,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.080
and now it goes from being dark to having, like,

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:45.881
so much extra light. Like,

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:47.261
look at the difference. Watch.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.900
Hold on, let me put it here. We can see.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.780
Watch the difference.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.660
Okay. Dark.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.400
They're linked right here.

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:15.741
If you have a dark little corner that you need to fix,
