00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
Today's Election Day, which means most kids are out of school,

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:04.281
which means most kids had to find child care.

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:06.361
Most mothers had to find child care for their kids,

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:10.441
because unequivocally, moms carry the burden of all this extra stuff,

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:12.961
these extra days off, these random holidays,

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:14.681
these teacher work days. Moms

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:16.281
the one who has to be stuck holding the bag

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.941
if she doesn't find child care.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.080
And that's because most women,

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:22.041
working or not, are the primary parent of their children.

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:23.161
And if you don't believe me,

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:25.081
ask your male co workers who have kids,

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:27.581
what their kids are doing today since they're off school.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.860
And if they happen to know what they're doing, ask who set it up.
