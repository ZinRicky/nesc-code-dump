00:00.240 --> 00:02.200
Recently, there was some leaked footage from

00:02.200 --> 00:04.720
the owner of the Miss Universe Organization,

00:04.720 --> 00:05.920
and in it, the owner said,

00:05.920 --> 00:07.520
we're going to accept everything.

00:07.520 --> 00:08.240
Trans women,

00:08.240 --> 00:09.640
married women, fat women.

00:09.640 --> 00:10.760
But they don't understand.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.400
They think if I can compete,

00:12.400 --> 00:13.680
I can win between us.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.700
We know they can compete,

00:15.800 --> 00:16.720
but they can't win.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.640
As a married woman who competes in pageants

00:18.640 --> 00:20.040
and is actually a titleholder right now,

00:20.040 --> 00:21.280
I have some thoughts about this,

00:21.280 --> 00:22.920
and they might not be what you think.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.920
I am not at all surprised by this.

00:24.920 --> 00:25.640
Back last year,

00:25.640 --> 00:27.680
when the Miss Universe Organization announced that it

00:27.680 --> 00:29.960
was going to start allowing married women to compete

00:29.960 --> 00:32.000
and that there was no longer going to be an age limit,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I remember a lot of people around me celebrating

00:34.000 --> 00:34.800
and being excited

00:34.800 --> 00:35.440
and even, like,

00:35.440 --> 00:36.160
nudging me, being like,

00:36.160 --> 00:37.080
are you gonna compete in it?

00:37.080 --> 00:38.840
And I just remember kind of thinking

00:38.840 --> 00:40.520
it felt patronizing.

00:40.520 --> 00:41.960
It felt funny.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.040
If any person can compete and be Miss Universe,

00:45.040 --> 00:47.600
like, what does Miss Universe even mean?

00:47.600 --> 00:51.160
Nowadays, we are terrified of the word exclusion, right?

00:51.160 --> 00:53.120
But we don't realize that organizations,

00:53.120 --> 00:54.500
businesses, teams,

00:54.560 --> 00:55.920
they exclude all the time.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.000
Take Major League Baseball,

00:57.000 --> 00:57.760
for example.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.000
By its very nature,

00:59.000 --> 01:03.440
it excludes everybody who isn't amazing at baseball.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.400
It is very, very exclusive.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.400
And I could never be in the MLB,

01:07.400 --> 01:08.640
and that's okay.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.480
Exclusion is everywhere,

01:10.480 --> 01:12.600
and that's sometimes okay.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.520
It would be so refreshing to see a business

01:14.520 --> 01:15.440
Or an organization

01:15.440 --> 01:16.920
kind of own that and say, yes,

01:16.920 --> 01:19.040
we are the Miss Universe Organization.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.960
You must be a miss to compete.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.080
Most of us would be absolutely okay with that.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.040
Like, just be honest.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.660
Just own who you are.

01:25.720 --> 01:26.520
I'm a married woman.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.520
I am excluded from the Miss Universe pageant.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.080
That only makes sense.

01:31.080 --> 01:31.800
And that's okay.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.320
I can go in the Mrs. Pageant.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.880
I can do a bunch of other things. It's okay.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.080
But a lot of businesses and a lot of organizations

01:38.080 --> 01:40.520
do this as kind of a virtue signal, right?

01:40.520 --> 01:41.860
To be like, look at us,

01:41.920 --> 01:43.480
we are so inclusive.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.200
And after a while,

01:44.200 --> 01:47.000
it just starts to feel foamy and patronizing.

01:47.000 --> 01:47.840
And the only difference

01:47.840 --> 01:49.800
between the Miss Universe Organization

01:49.800 --> 01:51.560
and a lot of other companies and businesses

01:51.560 --> 01:53.269
is that Miss Universe got caught.
