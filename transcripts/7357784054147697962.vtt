States are passing laws, uh,

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:05.301

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.560
and grants and business grants.

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:10.801
Trying to drive women back into the kitchen and then saying,

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:13.781

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.800
Women, wake up when a war is being waged upon you.

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:20.321
You are at war whether you wanna be at or not.

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:24.924
And the Republican Party has openly declared war on women. Wake up!
