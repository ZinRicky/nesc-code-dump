00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.840
Afternoon, Julia.

00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:01.601
You know my pronouns.

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:02.081
Are they them?

00:00:02.082 --> 00:00:03.101
How you doing?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.240
Yeah, um.

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:07.081
Thank you for telling me your pronouns.

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:09.041
I use correct grammar,

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.321
so the only.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:14.201
Only thing I would need to refer you to is to your face would be you.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:16.721
But I'm. I'm not being rude.

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:17.721
You can choose your pronouns.

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.161
You can choose what you want to call yourself,

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.021
but you don't have.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.040
You don't get to require me to use incorrect grammar

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:24.361
and factually incorrect things.

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:25.501
You're not a plural.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.200
You're a. You're a.

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:27.501
You're one person,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.080
and you're a. You're a female person.

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:30.401
So I will use she and her,

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:31.621
thank you very much.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.800
Do what you like,

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:33.321
I guess. No,

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:34.561
you won't. You didn't need to tell me then,

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:35.361
did you?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.840
Maybe I'm just making sure people know

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:41.021
in case they're watching and they wanna refer to me respectfully.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.300
Is it disrespectful for me to use correct factual grammar?

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.960
It's not incorrect or on factual grammar to use singular they

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:51.621
them pronouns to an individual.
