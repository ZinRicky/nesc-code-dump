00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.280
Hello, I started a business that takes the men out of mentoring.

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:07.801
It's called raise the Crowd Studio because it takes a village, right?

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:11.041
Some really exciting news about my second business,

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:14.041
raise the crowd. I'm also the co and founder of she's a crowd,

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:16.561
which is a data driven global tech startup

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:19.641
which closes the gender data gap to address sexual violence.

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:22.201
But I also started raise the crowd with a couple of other women

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:24.761
to support female and non binary founders

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.621
to thrive and grow their businesses

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.720
organically and sustainably

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.401
and achieve their dreams. Now when I was younger,

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:32.681
I've been in the social impact space,

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:34.421
entrepreneur space for 14 years.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.720
And when I was younger, I got paired a lot with mentors

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.521
and they were pretty much always men back in those days

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:42.461
and they would spend all their time telling me

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.720
how much they respect women

00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:44.721
or talking down to me

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:47.081
and I even got sexually harassed by one of the mentors

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:52.181
I was paired with. So we help diverse people solve diverse problems.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.700
We don't want more Mark Zuckerberg clones.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.000
We wanna see a world where these problems are taken seriously

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.401
and invested in.

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:04.621
I have noticed so many gaps over the years in what is provided

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.320
specifically to diversity founders.

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:09.561
So we have a social worker on board who helps with neurodiversity

00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:11.161
and things like accountability,

00:01:11.162 --> 00:01:14.101
mentoring and um, organizational challenges.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.620
We do brand development, business development, marketing,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.960
grant writing and attracting funding

00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:22.401
and Every single client gets a personalised development plan

00:01:22.402 --> 00:01:25.041
and then a social worker checking in with them every single week.

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:28.041
We wanna hone in on specifically what women

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:30.061
and diversity founders need

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.480
and provide that to them so that they can thrive and grow,

00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:35.121
achieve their dreams. We're nominated

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:37.541
and we're on the leaderboard for the Spark Business Grants.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.500
So that means we just need a couple hundred more votes

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.440
and then we'll get $10,000 so that we can help you

00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:47.301
for $10,000. That's gonna allow us to grow our business and support

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.480
and continue to provide

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:52.501
discounts and free advice to as many different

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.160
diversity founders as we can.

00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:57.001
I personally could not have started she's a crowd

00:01:57.002 --> 00:02:00.461
or raise the crowd without help from incredible women

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.480
and that's what we're trying to do for others.

00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:04.541
