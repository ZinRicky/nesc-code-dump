00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Lisa, what post election hobby are you starting to cultivate? Because,

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:05.401
you know, things feel out of control.

00:00:05.402 --> 00:00:08.181
We need something to control in our tiny little lives.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.460
So glad you asked. It is book acquisition.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.200
Now, this was already a hobby of mine because I'm a home school mom,

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:15.521
so we have a little home library,

00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:18.321
but I wanted to expand that, um,

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:19.321
just because, A,

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.721
I'm a homeschool mom, so you can never have enough books,

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:22.841
never have enough knowledge.

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:26.721
Knowledge is power. Knowledge is everything, right?

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:30.141
And they can't get rid of all the books,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.820
and in a home school, they can't ban the books.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.560
So I just went to my local habitat for Humanity Restore.

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:37.001
By the way, if you were in Charleston,

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.541
the Mount Pleasant one is fabulous.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.240
And I got what I would consider probably around 100 books,

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:46.601
maybe more, for about $60.

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:47.861
Now, I'm talking fiction,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.440
non fiction, hobby, uh,

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:53.501
encyclopedia, thesaurus,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.160
all sorts of different types of books.

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:57.121
And I'm gonna continue adding to our home library.

00:00:57.122 --> 00:00:57.881
A, again,

00:00:57.882 --> 00:00:58.721
because I'm a homeschool mom,

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:01.021
and B, because you cannot ban knowledge,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.580
and I live in a southern state where they actively are banning books.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.600
I am also focusing in on books,

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.641
of things of knowledge that I do not have yet.

00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:12.041
Skill sets and hobbies that I have not acquired in my brain.

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:13.441
I would like to have references for.

00:01:13.442 --> 00:01:14.641
So I've got. Let's see,

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:15.801
this one I'm really excited about.

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:17.201
Somebody put Some post its in these.

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.881
Can't wait to see what they posted it.

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:20.781
Big Book of Backyard Projects.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.840
Fucking absolutely. Um,

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:25.481
everything for home brewing, because,

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:29.021
you know, prohibition doesn't usually stop at women's rights.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.880
Um, very excited about these two.

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:31.481
And then, of course,

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:32.881
for the kids, Sarah Plain and tall,

00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:36.481
an absolute classic. Is this gonna fix the state of the world?

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:37.121
Absolutely not.

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:40.561
But will I be the library for anybody who needs access to education

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:42.721
if we don't like where the school system's going?

00:01:42.722 --> 00:01:44.721
Absolutely. Let's do rebel educator.

00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:47.041
Was not on my bingo card for my life.

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:49.701
Was not. Was not at all. But here we are.
