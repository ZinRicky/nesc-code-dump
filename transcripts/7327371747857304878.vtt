00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
I don't necessarily know if these products work

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:07.741
and I don't know that I necessarily am using them uh for that

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.460
what I do know is being in a shitty relationship has made me cry

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.000
a lot more than I ever have in my whole entire life

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.181
and you know how like

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.340
the president

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.720
when you see pictures of like

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.841
any sitting president

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:27.081
they show their first day in office and they show their last day in office

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:28.561
that's kinda how I feel

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.241
you know five years after divorce

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:33.981
so I buy these products just

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.020
even if it's for the placebo effect

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.660
even if it's cause I'm like you know

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.220
I just need to do something other than cry sometimes

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.380
and so not only does that help me stop crying

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.020
it makes me kind of feel like I'm doing something

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.140
to combat the shit that goes on in my life

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.000
so if you want one

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:00.961
the link is right here

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:02.861
I don't know if it works

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.880
but I know it makes me feel better

00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:09.061
and I bought myself a tiny little treat

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.160
there's coupons all the time on TikTok

00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:14.381
use the fucking coupon and get it for free

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.820
you know what I mean

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.820
you know what I mean
