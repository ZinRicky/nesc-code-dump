00:00.000 --> 00:01.960
I spent the last four days in New York,

00:01.961 --> 00:05.681
and now it's time to travel to Orange County to see my kids again.

00:05.682 --> 00:07.001
Every work trip I go on,

00:07.002 --> 00:09.041
I always take little whimsy Lou with me.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.561
She's my little travel buddy,

00:10.562 --> 00:12.681
and she's been doing so good on set

00:12.682 --> 00:14.721
and running around New York for meetings.

00:14.722 --> 00:17.561
Today we caught a flight from New York to Orange County,

00:17.562 --> 00:19.801
where we'll be spending a little bit of time.

00:19.802 --> 00:23.241
So I did my makeup and then packed up the rest of my bag.

00:23.242 --> 00:26.721
I still haven't fully figured out how to pack a bag properly,

00:26.722 --> 00:29.081
but we always make it work somehow.

00:29.082 --> 00:29.721
At this point,

00:29.722 --> 00:31.041
I was running a little late,

00:31.042 --> 00:33.941
so I rushed out the door, and we headed to the airport.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.280
Was about an hour drive,

00:35.281 --> 00:37.961
but I love driving or walking through New York.

00:37.962 --> 00:40.081
There's just something so magical about it.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.361
Once we got to the airport,

00:41.362 --> 00:44.121
we checked in our bags and headed through security,

00:44.122 --> 00:48.041
and we actually made it perfectly on time to board the plane,

00:48.042 --> 00:49.041
and before we know it,

00:49.042 --> 00:50.121
we were in the air.

00:50.122 --> 00:53.041
I always bring my journal with me pen,

00:53.042 --> 00:54.401
and sometimes I bring a book.

00:54.402 --> 00:57.481
But lately, I've been listening to audible quite a lot,

00:57.482 --> 01:00.001
and I just started listening to Crescent City.

01:00.002 --> 01:03.241
I also feel like I haven't watched a good movie in a long time,

01:03.242 --> 01:04.881
so if you have recommendations,

01:04.882 --> 01:06.681
let me know. We landed in LA,

01:06.682 --> 01:09.041
and it felt so nostalgic being back here.

01:09.042 --> 01:10.161
Before I got in the car

01:10.162 --> 01:13.301
and we drove about an hour and a half down to Dana Point,

01:13.400 --> 01:14.720
lucky couldn't wait any longer,

01:14.721 --> 01:17.001
so he met us on the last fourth of our drive

01:17.002 --> 01:19.201
to drive me back to the house himself.

01:19.202 --> 01:21.681
I was so excited to see the kids at this point.

01:21.682 --> 01:22.601
And when I got back,

01:22.602 --> 01:23.841
they drew me pictures,

01:23.842 --> 01:25.521
which was so freaking cute.

01:25.522 --> 01:28.041
They were so excited to see me in whimsy again,

01:28.042 --> 01:30.081
and they couldn't wait to take me down to the beach

01:30.082 --> 01:32.481
and show me everything that they've been up to

01:32.482 --> 01:34.948
and all the things they wanna do now that I'm here.
