00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.760
so my posts are gonna be all over the place this week

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:05.960
um life is continuing as normal here in Charleston

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:09.240
and I'm gonna be posting some of my regular stuff

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:12.520
but on the back of my mind constantly is what's going on in North Carolina

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:16.400
and how I can help Matt and I are going on a trip this weekend to Utah

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:18.720
like my kids still have school and activities

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:20.440
it's the Jewish New Year this weekend

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:24.220
so life for us is continuing on pretty much as normal

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.800
but I've just posted a comprehensive list of places that you can donate

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:30.660
to help the relief efforts for Western North Carolina

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.180
on top of that I am starting to collect supplies

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.920
me and Matt are planning to go up early next week

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:40.320
grocery stores are already low on stuff

00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:42.900
things around Charleston are starting to get low

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.640
um I saw Costco and Walmart in Mount Pleasant already out of water

00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:50.940
I think everyone's anticipating either another Hurricane

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.300
realizing how unprepared we are

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.080
and anticipating the longshoreman strike

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:57.960
so if you're local to the Charleston area

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.620
make sure that you are prepared for a storm event

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.220
if you have anything extra you can donate to bring up to North Carolina

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.440
you can message me or

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:08.640
there are lots of neighborhoods that are collecting items right now

00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:10.160
that you can donate to as well

00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:12.400
things like gas batteries

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:14.320
blankets baby items

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:15.840
so like formula diapers

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:18.200
baby wipes water is a big one

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:19.600
water and gasoline I think

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:21.600
are the biggest ones but honestly

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.000
anything that y'all can donate

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.320
um I know it doesn't feel like enough

00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:28.360
but every little bit is going to help

00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:30.920
so along with my regularly scheduled content

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:35.720
I will be posting as many updates as I can about Western North Carolina

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:39.140
from friends and loved ones who I get information from

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.920
from other resources from Facebook groups etc

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:43.840
I just heard today actually

00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:47.140
a big announcement that I forty is open

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.840
I forty East is open from Asheville

00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:54.400
and they're saying that there are supplies in Hickory and east of that as well

00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:56.640
I forty West is still closed

00:01:56.641 --> 00:02:00.520
but the North Carolina dot is saying that it should be reopening soon

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:04.220
and I got that information from North Carolina's weather authority

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.360
which is a Facebook group that

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:08.240
I have been receiving updates on the situation in North Carolina

00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:09.160
if you wanna follow along

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:10.720
go ahead and check them out as well

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:13.160
it seems to be the best place to get the most up to date

00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:15.486
information about the relief efforts
