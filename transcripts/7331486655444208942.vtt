Let's go get one of my pregnancy cravings. And lately,

00:03.040 --> 00:05.760
my husband and I have been craving the exact same thing.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.100
So when he said he wanted Korean barbecue,

00:08.640 --> 00:10.200
I needed it right then and there.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.360
So we went to one of our favorite spots.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.440
My favorite things are the side dishes.

00:14.440 --> 00:15.960
The pickled cucumber kimchi,

00:15.960 --> 00:17.120
sweet potato noodles,

00:17.120 --> 00:20.640
everything. So I started off by trying all the sides.

00:20.640 --> 00:21.840
We got the all you can eat

00:21.840 --> 00:23.800
because lucky eats for three people,

00:23.800 --> 00:25.520
so that's the only thing that makes sense.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.940
I also ordered this kimchi stew.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.200
It was so good,

00:29.200 --> 00:30.360
especially with the rice.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.800
And the tofu was really good.

00:31.800 --> 00:32.520
It was spicy,

00:32.520 --> 00:33.820
but not too spicy.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.520
And then we got five orders of beef bulgogi

00:36.520 --> 00:38.140
and spicy pork belly.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.120
Lucky always grills up the meat,

00:40.120 --> 00:43.400
and he always make sure that I get the first batch.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.320
There's nothing better than beef bulgogi

00:45.320 --> 00:47.020
with fresh kimchi.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.520
Lucky ended up ordering another three orders

00:49.520 --> 00:51.880
of beef bulgogi and three more rice.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.400
I clocked out at this point.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.100
I made him try the kimchi soup.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.760
He absolutely hated it.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.840
But he also doesn't like kimchi and soup,

00:59.840 --> 01:02.140
so I was kind of expecting this.

01:02.280 --> 01:02.920
At this point,

01:02.920 --> 01:03.840
I was stuffed,

01:03.840 --> 01:06.200
so we left to get something sweet.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.660
I always need something sweet after my meals,

01:08.920 --> 01:11.280
and my favorite thing lately have been

01:11.280 --> 01:13.040
vanilla cones from McDonald's.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.980
I don't think they had talked about enough.
