00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.520
She addresses why she's crying in a,

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.701
like, a current TMZ article.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.320
She was crying because the men were disrespectful.

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:09.441
Well, in the TMZ interview she did,

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.501
she explains that she's crying because,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.480
like, immediately after that,

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:14.161
she was, like,

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:18.201
still in the shower when the documentary crew was coming up and, like,

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:19.841
posted up in the living room waiting for her.

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:20.801
So she didn't get, like,

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:22.921
even 30 seconds to breathe.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.081
She came out and was like,

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:25.261
oh, hey. Um.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.560
And immediately had to start answering questions.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:28.601
And then he was there for, like,

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:30.361
an hour in her face, and she was like, yeah,

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.941
it's overwhelming. It's overwhelming, but.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.760
And even when she's crying,

00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:36.401
she's more crying cause she's like, gosh,

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:37.281
I really, you know,

00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:39.361
these men have supported me all these years,

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:41.341
and I promised them a certain experience,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.900
and I'm kind of sad that it wasn't the way that I wanted.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.420
She's not crying cause she's hurt, sad, traumatized.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.220
She's crying cause this is her fantasy

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.580
that didn't go the way that she planned and how she wanted,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.480
and a lot of the men were disrespectful.

00:00:58.481 --> 00:01:01.621
They were giving her a guilt trip and making her feel even worse.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.040
So that's why she was crying,

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.541
because of their disrespect

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.660
and the way that it kind of ruined the fantasy for her.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.440
But all in all, she was doing the 100 to prepare for doing the thousand,

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:14.881
because, like,

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:16.981
in a couple days, she's doing 300.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.900
She's just Like, ramping up.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.420
She super, super duper enjoys it.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.680
She has an amazing relationship with her family.

00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:26.541
Like, she talks to her mom every day.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.080
She's an amazing businesswoman.

00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:28.761
She has, like,

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:31.501
eight or nine employees and is looking for more.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.420
Like, she's good. She's.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.060
She's more than good. Like,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.640
I can only wish my children are that happy and successful

00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:44.581
at the shit that they wanna do in life.
