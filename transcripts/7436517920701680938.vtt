00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.820
Good morning.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.120
You know, everybody always ask me why I use candles all the time,

00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:08.801
but, like,

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:11.761
does this not just make life a little cozier?

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:14.201
Let me show you how I make my morning coffee.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:16.541
Things first, you're gonna start with an egg yolk.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.600
We're actually starting with a different egg,

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:21.641
cause that other one was fertilized and had an embryo in it,

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:23.341
and I don't want that in my coffee.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.080
Turn on the light so y'all can see what I'm doing.

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:31.601
But I'm just taking sugar.

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:34.741
You can use any sweetener you want. Just doing about

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.140
a tablespoon and a half cocoa powder.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.680
Tablespoon.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.760
And take real salt. Redmond's real salt.

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:46.321
Because I don't want table salt,

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:47.421
I want real salt.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.060
Just a pinch.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.560
Little mini blender and half. Half.

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.716
This is a lot better if you use heavy cream. But look at that.
