There's nothing that brings me more joy than cookie dough ice cream,

00:03.441 --> 00:06.641
and this joyforia fragrance by Charlotte Tilbury

00:06.642 --> 00:11.361
reminded me of just that. Smells warm and radiant with hints of vanilla,

00:11.362 --> 00:13.501
cash Niroly, and Jasmine.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.400
Brings me so much happiness.

00:15.401 --> 00:19.801
So obviously I associate that one of my favorite ice cream flavors,

00:19.802 --> 00:21.641
which is cookie dough ice cream.

00:21.642 --> 00:23.041
Warm up my milk, vanilla,

00:23.042 --> 00:25.921
and sugar on the top and then temper my eggs

00:25.922 --> 00:29.721
before pouring the mixture back into my pot and letting it thicken.

00:29.722 --> 00:32.441
Once it was thick enough to coat the back of my spoon,

00:32.442 --> 00:35.361
I strained it and combined it with some heavy cream

00:35.362 --> 00:37.421
before letting it chill in the fridge.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.160
In the meantime, I got started on making my cookie dough

00:40.161 --> 00:42.241
and combined some butter and sugar.

00:42.242 --> 00:43.481
Once that was all combined,

00:43.482 --> 00:45.681
I added all of my dry ingredients,

00:45.682 --> 00:47.801
which were some flour, baking soda,

00:47.802 --> 00:50.701
baking powder, and some chopped up chocolate.

00:50.720 --> 00:51.920
Once that was all combined,

00:51.921 --> 00:54.201
I rolled my cookie dough into little balls

00:54.202 --> 00:55.961
and put them on a baking sheet,

00:55.962 --> 00:59.801
which I then put in the freezer until all my balls were frozen.

00:59.802 --> 01:02.761
In the meantime, I started churning my ice cream.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.721
Once it hit the consistency I wanted,

01:04.722 --> 01:06.601
I added my frozen cookie dough

01:06.602 --> 01:09.701
and let that churn for a couple minutes longer.

01:09.760 --> 01:13.960
That looked ready to me. I transferred it over to my storage container,

01:13.961 --> 01:15.961
topped it with some more of the cookie dough

01:15.962 --> 01:18.041
and some leftover chocolate.

01:18.042 --> 01:21.081
I popped this In the freezer for another four hours.

01:21.082 --> 01:24.104
The taste of this ice cream brought me so much joy.
