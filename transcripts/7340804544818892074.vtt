and it'll help prevent your man from cheating

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:15.901
number one always have food ready on the table

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.100
okay food really is the way that a man's heart

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.840
okay he's not gonna be going to a drive thru or restaurant

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:27.121
where he can talk to a cute girl behind the register or have a girl serve him

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:29.021
no that should be your duty

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.640
men connect food with happiness

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:34.381
so always, always remember to make sure he's fed

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.160
No 2 show affection.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.341
take initiative,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.120
hug him, kiss him,

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:41.601
show him everyday how happy he really makes you!

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:43.401
men are big on affection

00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:44.601
they wanna feel special,

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:45.821
just like we do.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.240
if you're not doing this

00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:49.421
he's gonna be looking for elsewhere

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.180
he shouldn't have to beg for affection

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.640
or beg to have his needs met as a man

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:56.741
No. 3 clean for him

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.980
clean the house,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.260
do his laundry,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.360
always make sure his clothes are cleaned.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:04.881
and don't get annoyed with him because he needs help to do his laundry.

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:05.721
if itâ€™s easy for you,

00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:06.641
but hard for him.

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:08.141
why don't you just help him out?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.200
make sure the house is tidy as well.

00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:12.921
a man is more likely to want to come home to you,

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:15.801
or stay home if the house is tidy and clean.

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:17.361
he'll appreciate this

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:18.281
and not only that

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:20.961
why would he ever leave a good woman who takes care of them?

00:01:20.962 --> 00:01:24.021
No. 4 do not bicker or complain to him.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.120
men do not have a taste for drama.

00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:27.961
so leave that for your girlfriends.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:29.921
he wants to relax when he gets home,

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:34.141
so if you're always complaining or bickering at him to do something,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.180
he's not gonna feel like the man of the house.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.300
and guess what he'll be looking outside of your house to feel like the man.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.860
No. 5 be his peace.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.320
you should be the one that where he gets home,

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:46.881
you melt his stress away.

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:50.201
simply understand his needs and provide him with such.

00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:52.381
if he needs to relax or unwind,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.720
let him. This ensures 

00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:54.921
he won't be wandering off

00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:57.001
looking for other girls to be his peace.

00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:58.001
you be his peace,

00:01:58.002 --> 00:01:59.561
and that will make him happy!

00:01:59.562 --> 00:02:01.701
So always make sure he's never hungry,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.580
show him affection,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.200
keep the house tidy,

00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:07.021
make sure his needs are met,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.620
and be his peace.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.080
it's that simple.

00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:12.781
and you'll be able to keep your man happy
