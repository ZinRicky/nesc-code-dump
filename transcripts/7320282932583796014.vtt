00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.000
okay it's been said a million times

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.600
but I feel the need to reiterate

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.240
because I just saw a video of a girl

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:08.040
you know in the age of trad wifery

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.040
okay this video is about trad wives um

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:12.960
or even just women who are like

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.320
staying home and cooking and cleaning

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:16.700
is so much better than being a corporate baddie

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.120
um I saw a woman who said

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:18.960
don't tell the feminists

00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:19.800
but you know

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:21.340
I would rather cook and clean

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.360
and then people are replying and stitching and saying okay

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:25.960
but feminism is about choosing

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:30.300
like you get to choose whether or not you wanna be a stay at home mom

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.520
or wife or girlfriend or whatever but

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:35.220
or like being a corporate baddie

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.880
and I'm not stitching or tagging

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:39.600
cause I'm truly not trying to call anyone out

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.960
I just need to put it out there that you know

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:46.000
we've already been through this whole notion of choice feminism

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:50.920
and how feminism is not about women just doing whatever they want

00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:55.460
and people just supporting whatever it is that an individual woman wants

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.740
feminism is about the liberation of the masses from patriarchal oppression

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.340
and there are a lot of women

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.960
and we see it with the trad wives

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:09.140
there are a lot of women who do not make choices that align with feminism

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.920
and I need to just write a substack

00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:11.600
essay about this

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.020
because like

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.760
tradwife culture or like

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:17.680
women who are toying with the idea of just being stay at home girlfriends

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:18.820
or wives or whatever

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.560
like that's a direct consequence of capitalism

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:24.840
that's a direct consequence of like okay

00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:25.840
the whole corporate baddie

00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:28.200
like 9 to 5 life

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:28.960
you know that

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:30.440
you know feminism has tried to sell us

00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:31.960
it's not all sex and the city

00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:33.000
it's not all thirty

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:33.760
flirty and thriving

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:34.880
like this is not fun

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:35.640
working sucks

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:37.800
and yeah jobs suck

00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:39.160
but that's why we need to become Marxist

00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:41.040
feminists in the year 2024

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:43.040
and then comes the whole question of like

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:44.400
choice and seriously

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:45.520
I'm gonna write an essay about this

00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:48.420
because it's too much to get into on TikTok but like

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.280
when you are choosing between the lesser of two evils

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:56.160
like between being a slave to capitalism versus being a slave to your husband

00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:58.320
like is that actually like

00:01:58.321 --> 00:01:59.720
even a choice

00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:02.320
like that's the great tragedy of choice feminism

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.400
is that you're choosing between the lesser two evils

00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:05.240
you're choosing

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:06.920
you know you're picking your poison

00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:08.360
so is that really a choice like

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:13.680
are we actually even making these choices that you're saying that we're making

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:14.840
because you know

00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:16.360
in a truly egalitarian

00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:17.560
feminist society

00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:19.760
the choices that women

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:20.760
you know non men

00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:23.280
like everyone who is oppressed by patriarchy

00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:25.200
like these choices that we're making

00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.240
um they should be completely autonomous

00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:30.480
they should not be made under coercion

00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:32.320
they should not be made under threat of

00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:33.680
like you know

00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:35.920
either be a corporate baddie

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:38.040
or you'll go homeless or you know

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:40.280
either be a stay at home wife and mother

00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:41.780
or go homeless

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.800
and like here's the disclaimer

00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:45.000
if you have a partner

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:46.280
regardless of their gender

00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:48.900
if you have a partner that you feel

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.480
safe and comfortable being financially and materially dependent upon

00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:53.680
like if you are

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:55.320
you know the person who keeps house

00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:58.280
and they're the person who goes to their 9 to 5

00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:00.280
like great genuinely

00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:00.760
good for you

00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.080
but in an ideal world

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:07.000
nobody would ever be financially and materially dependent upon like

00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:08.000
another individual

00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:10.040
their society would just take care of them

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:11.360
regardless of what they do

00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:16.286
regardless of whether they work outside the home or within it so anyway
