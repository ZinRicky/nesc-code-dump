00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
I have a gluten sensitivity,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.780
and my husband and I visited Europe last year,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.040
and it was really interesting

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.640
because all of the gluten that I ate over there,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.920
I digested fine.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.180
I didn't have any reactions to it.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.600
Instead of just doing gluten free things,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.620
today, I actually ordered flour from Italy,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.880
and we're gonna make a sourdough starter with it,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.000
and we're gonna see how this goes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.740
This is kind of an experiment,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.120
and if my body does not react well to it,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.640
that's okay.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.480
My husband can eat all of the sourdough,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.360
and he will be very happy about it.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.060
To do 100 grams of this flour.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.820
Now we're gonna add 100 grams of spring water.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.160
I have my little sourdough starter,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.840
and now we will wait about 24 hours

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.256
and then feed it again.
