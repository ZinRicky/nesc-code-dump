I hate the taste of water,

00:01.521 --> 00:05.721
so I always need to keep my liquid IV hydration multipliers on hand.

00:05.722 --> 00:07.241
Obsessed with their new packaging

00:07.242 --> 00:10.401
and their pear flavor has been my favorite one lately.

00:10.402 --> 00:13.761
So naturally that inspired me to make one of my favorite things,

00:13.762 --> 00:15.861
which is bread and pear jam.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.640
I combined all of my ingredients in my stand mixer

00:18.641 --> 00:20.881
and gave that a mix until it came together

00:20.882 --> 00:23.441
before gradually adding in more flour.

00:23.442 --> 00:25.601
Once it reached the consistency I wanted,

00:25.602 --> 00:27.961
I transferred it over to a greased bowl

00:27.962 --> 00:30.641
and let that rise until it doubled in size.

00:30.642 --> 00:33.961
I cut my dough in half since I was making two loafs,

00:33.962 --> 00:37.441
and rolled those pieces up to fit into my loaf pan,

00:37.442 --> 00:39.281
then let that rise for another hour

00:39.282 --> 00:41.761
while I got started on making my pear jam.

00:41.762 --> 00:44.001
I like using different varieties of pears.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.721
I just make sure that they're ripe.

00:45.722 --> 00:46.921
Start by peeling them

00:46.922 --> 00:49.881
and then wrapping them up in small pieces

00:49.882 --> 00:52.361
before transferring them over to a bowl.

00:52.362 --> 00:53.961
I have all my pears in a bowl.

00:53.962 --> 00:56.521
I add some sugar and lemon juice.

00:56.522 --> 00:58.481
Let that sit for about six hours.

00:58.482 --> 01:00.121
You can also do it overnight.

01:00.122 --> 01:01.641
Once my bread has risen,

01:01.642 --> 01:06.261
I pop it in the oven for about 30 minutes until it's golden brown.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.040
Once it's done,

01:07.041 --> 01:09.761
I transfer it over to a wire rack to cool.

01:09.762 --> 01:12.561
I decided on making a Rosemary and pear jam,

01:12.562 --> 01:16.661
so I chopped up some Rosemary and added That to a pot with my pears

01:16.840 --> 01:18.920
that boil for about 15 minutes.

01:18.921 --> 01:21.121
And once it reached the temperature I wanted,

01:21.122 --> 01:23.961
I transferred it over to a glass jar to cool.

01:23.962 --> 01:25.201
While my jam was cooling,

01:25.202 --> 01:28.321
I sliced up my bread and spread some butter on top.

01:28.322 --> 01:29.961
Lastly added my jam.

01:29.962 --> 01:33.161
And this was so good and so worth it.

01:33.162 --> 01:36.201
There's nothing better to me than fresh bread and a cold

01:36.202 --> 01:36.968
hydrating drink.
