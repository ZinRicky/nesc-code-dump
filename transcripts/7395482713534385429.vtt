00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.518
this is part 2 of turning my 

00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:03.098
Weird Barbie of a downstairs hallway

00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:04.240
 into something functional

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:05.960
and maybe not totally hideous

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:07.537
the concrete blocks that you can see was 

00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:09.000
actually the old exterior of the house

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.320
before they built the extension

00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:13.360
some 60 odd years ago which is why there's a window in it

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:14.443
*was* a window in it 

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:15.940
cause she really needed to go

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.840
I did have a couple of comments from people in part 1

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:19.533
which I've linked in the caption telling me 

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:20.880
that I should have saved the window

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:23.680
and aside from the fact that that glass was old and brittle as hell

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.720
and we've got kids constantly running around here

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:26.920
so it could be a hazard

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:30.000
just having a window in the middle of an interior wall is weird to me

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.320
it makes no design sense and it means I can't use the wall for other things

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:34.130
so it had to go 

00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:36.560
once we had finished simply demolishing, prewiring

00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:37.840
insulating, framing

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:39.000
GIBing, plastering

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:40.720
Panelling, sanding and priming

00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:42.400
then we were finally ready to paint

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.832
and I chose this unsurprisingly controversial colour

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:45.440
 called Tiki Tiki from Dulux

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:47.200
if you know me

00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:48.680
you know that prior to moving in here

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.360
I spent three years living in a sad beige new build of my own making

00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:55.800
this house is a beautiful big mid century home and she really suits colour

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:58.080
I think she would be an autumn or a winter girlie

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:00.040
cause she just looks so good in the jewel tones

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:02.000
I played around with different colours in the past here

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.760
and she's definitely not a pastel girlie

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.640
which means we need to be all in without colour or all out

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:08.160
I don't make the rules, she does

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.960
but did you know that crimson in interiors was super popular

00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:14.560
from mid 40s to mid 60s, right around the time that this house was built?

00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:16.880
and there's a few reasons behind that apparently anyway

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:18.680
it had its moment for like 30 years

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:20.920
and then it fell out of fashion for another 60

00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:22.840
but I think we're seeing a resurgence

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:24.560
and maybe I'm just looking for confirmation bias

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:26.040
but I'm definitely seeing it everywhere

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:27.440
it's all over my Pinterest feed

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.240
and it's in just about every interiors article that I read

00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:32.760
So I know it's not just me saying that Crimson is making a comeback

00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.600
so I thought I might try it out in my home and see if I like it

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:37.240
and I know not everyone's gonna like it

00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:39.480
I already heard you in Part 1 but that's okay

00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:40.440
you don't have to like it

00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:42.440
I fkn love it. it's giving old money red

00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:43.440
it's giving heritage

00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:46.200
it's giving not afraid to try new things and I'm here for it plus

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.840
it's just paint if I ever get sick of it

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.547
I can change it 

00:01:48.548 --> 00:01:50.760
somebody asked me how we do the capping at the top

00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:51.680
so this is how

00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:55.520
I stand here and supervise while my husband puts these two bits of wood up

00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:58.060
then it was time to finish the wall with a nice big thick skirt

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.440
I love using big thick skirting boards in this home

00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:02.600
because that's what all of the original areas had

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:04.720
and it feels like a bit of an homage to time gone by

00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:06.360
which is kinda all I wanna do here

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:08.800
our amazing sparkies came back to do the final fit off

00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:11.640
and we did have to wait a little bit to get our hands on these copper lights

00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:12.669
but I think it was worth it 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.920
quick reminder of where we started

00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:15.480
and this is where we ended up

00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:17.960
Itâ€™s still not done because eventually we're gonna replace the carpet

00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:19.560
and I still need to decorate obviously

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.323
I'm gonna turn this space into Memory Lane 

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:22.800
with family photos all the way along

00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:24.200
and this is just hallway phase 1

00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:26.680
cause it's gonna take us a bit of time to get it up the stairs

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.712
and right to the front door

00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:29.336
but yeah what do you think so far?
