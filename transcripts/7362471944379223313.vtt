00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.720
So the question is what you actually suppose we do?

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:05.421
Um, what realistically can be changed?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.680
So what I'm gonna do is outline the 5 key asks, um,

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.561
for all of the rallies that are going on

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:14.321
in this campaign that's going on.

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:14.921
The first is

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:19.721
to clear this epidemic of men murdering women as a national emergency

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:24.141
so that it gets funding and attention and an expedition of solutions.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.960
The next one is

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:29.721
changing the media regulation on publishing images of victims

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:35.061
because the media have been publishing these faces of the victims

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.360
right after attacks

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:39.681
and this is very traumatic for families and without families consent.

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:43.221
Next one is mandatory victim blaming prevention training,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.280
um, for like first responders, um,

00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:50.461
because most of them aren't actually trained in how to um,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.160
properly deal with a situation and then they can reinforce the trauma.

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:57.861
It's often called secondary victimization

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.740
before is alternative reporting options and um,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.760
domestic violence specialist in the court system.

00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:10.441
This is because um, so many women don't report

00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:14.501
and they don't report because there are huge barriers to reporting

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.200
including mistrust of authority,

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.721
the perception is too difficult,

00:01:17.722 --> 00:01:20.521
which it is, it's re traumatizing.

00:01:20.522 --> 00:01:23.041
They have internalized, um,

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:24.721
blame and shame and I could go on

00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:27.801
but there's heaps of really valid and legitimate reasons why

00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:30.561
a lot of different women and different groups don't report

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:35.121
and this is all aiming to address that so that we have actual justice,

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:39.601
um, and better data and The fifth one is better funding.

00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:40.861
Fund it, fund,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.520
fund it. It's never been funded.

00:01:42.521 --> 00:01:44.061
It's never been funded properly.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.880
Male behaviour change has never been funded properly.

00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:48.721
Services have never been funded properly.

00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:50.161
Research has never been funded properly.

00:01:50.162 --> 00:01:51.901
So the idea is to fund it.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.360
That's it. On an individual level,

00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:57.041
if you are a man, um,

00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:58.881
some things you can do include,

00:01:58.882 --> 00:02:00.421
you know, not killing women,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.940
um, not harassing women,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.120
not assaulting women, not coercing women,

00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:09.021
not gaslighting women, going to therapy,

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.000
doing the work, becoming an ally,

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.801
calling out your male friends,

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:16.121
calling out a sexist language,

00:02:16.122 --> 00:02:18.181
not expecting, um,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.460
your wife or women in your life to do all of the household labour,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.920
not really adhering to outdated and traditional gender norms

00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.741
because those are the things that prop up violence against women.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.049
I hope that helps.
