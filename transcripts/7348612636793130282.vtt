00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.280
My kids have never eaten a store bought Pop Tart before,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.960
and that's because they're loaded with food dyes like Red 40,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.280
Yellow 6 and Blue Wine,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.520
high fructose corn syrup,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.120
soybean oil, and enriched flour.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.400
While they don't even taste great,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.600
they are you. And I do feel like my kids should know what a Pop Tart is.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.560
I got to work immediately that afternoon.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.040
I have eincorn sourdough discard piling up in the fridge,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.760
so I decided to make these with discard

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.280
along with freshly milled whole grain eincorn flour.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.680
Eincorn is the most nutritious wheat

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.960
because it's the oldest variety

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.080
and hasn't gone through hybridization like modern wheat.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.320
And freshly melt has so many nutrients and vitamins.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.000
For those with gluten intolerances,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.560
ironcorn is a really great option.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.360
I'm using my tree ripened peaches from last summer for the jelly

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.160
filling, sweetened lightly with low glycemic coconut sugar.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
Assembling these Pop Tarts was easy

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.720
and I used a little water on my finger to act as a glue

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.240
for the bottom and top layers.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.680
Those baked.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.400
I made a simple glaze with powdered maple sugar and rock cream.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.880
I tried to make the glaze red with dehydrated strawberries,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.560
but it didn't work.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.440
These were so much better than the version in cellophane wrappers.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.840
My kids really liked them

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.860
and I froze them in smaller pieces for school lunch boxes.
