00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.760
so now that we're done our first year of homeschooling

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:03.240
I wanna talk about things that work for us

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:04.840
and things that we're gonna change for next year

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:08.080
the biggest change is that we're gonna be doing a co op next year

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:11.320
a co op means that you can do in person with other teachers

00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:13.320
learning with the same group of kids every week

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:15.200
our kids will be going two days a week

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:18.360
and then the rest of the week will be home doing traditional homeschool with mom

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.000
and that will come with its own curriculum

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:23.360
which means I don't have to search and find the curriculums I wanna use

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:24.520
even though I liked that part

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:26.580
so I'm a little hesitant to see how this goes

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.480
one thing I loved was outsourcing

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:30.840
we found great lessons and extracurriculars

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.520
that were working with homeschool students

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:36.140
that really made it just such a fun year for my kids

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.600
my biggest struggle was time management

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:42.360
I found our days were actually so busy that by the end of the day

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:44.280
I like if I hadn't figured out dinner already

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:46.000
we were kind of flying by the seat of our pants

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:50.260
so I plan to implement using companies like Hellofresh in the coming year

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.120
honestly keeping up with social media was really difficult too

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:55.720
and I don't know if that's gonna be easier next year because the co op

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:57.640
but it may be something I have to re evaluate

00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:59.454
I have more to tell you so part two
