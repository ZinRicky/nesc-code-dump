00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.720
Growing up,

00:00:00.721 --> 00:00:03.201
I thought that if I just lost weight then people would wanna date me.

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:03.841
Like, I thought that like,

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:06.881
that was the one thing that was keeping me from like

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:09.681
being relationship dating, whatever. Um,

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:12.921
cause I. I grew up especially like a very like fat phobic area,

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:14.161
but whatever. Um.

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:16.041
Turns out the issue now

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:19.741
growing up is not the people are attracted to me.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.240
Finding someone to be attracted to

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:23.721
is not the most difficult part about dating.

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:28.681
The most difficult part about dating is like how boring people are.

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.781
It's like finding people that you find interesting

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.200
and you like their personality and they like yours.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.361
Like, the amount of people that I scared off,

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:38.181
not with my size, but with my personality,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.640
cause I'm like a little intense and amongst other things,

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.421
but also like, I don't find a lot of people like,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.560
interesting enough to talk to.

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:48.041
Like, if you're not funny,

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:48.921
if you're not intelligent,

00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:50.821
if you're not kind, then like,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.560
it's not gonna work.

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:57.581
And I didn't realize how important those factors were, um.
