00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.720
apparently I'm a sucker for punishment

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:03.578
so welcome to day 2 of our 5 day 

00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:04.761
kids bedroom makeover

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:06.001
quick reminder of where we started

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.712
and since I saw you last my husband has 

00:00:07.713 --> 00:00:09.081
plastered and sanded these walls

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:10.214
so now I can prep and prime 

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:12.481
and as somebody in the thick of a whole house renovation

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:14.142
I'm well aware that the most painful part of 

00:00:14.143 --> 00:00:15.361
the process is prepping for paint

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:18.641
but in every room I use this Dulux 1-step prep which is a primer

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:20.241
sealer and undercoat all in one

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:22.475
and it’s anti-mould which in my very damp

00:00:22.476 --> 00:00:24.001
67 year old house I need

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.241
I will say it's pretty thick

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:27.004
pretty viscous kind of a bitch to get on 

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:27.521
respectfully

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:30.001
but for the time that you save and the finish you get it's worth it

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.761
so the brief at this point of the project was just to get this stuff

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:34.641
literally everywhere and that was day two done

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:36.428
on day three we came back and it was time 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:37.961
to put some colour back in the space

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:40.041
and this is usually where I get my motivation back

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.121
because I can start to see my vision coming to life

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:45.921
so quick backstory but my first born is about to turn 12 which is crazy

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:47.441
and this bedroom is his birthday present

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:49.881
and he currently has no idea what we're doing in here

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.460
he did pick his bedding which helped us 

00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:52.961
with colour and he asked for panelling

00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:54.641
but aside from that he's totally in the dark

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:56.521
I don't know about you but whenever I look at a project

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.241
I always gaslight myself into believing

00:00:58.242 --> 00:00:59.921
it's gonna be less work than it actually is

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:01.281
and when it comes time you're like

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:01.841
wow fk

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:03.121
there really is a lot to do in here isn’t there 

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:05.481
 so I ended up painting that panelling three times

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.521
and what I think is the perfect shade of green

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:09.441
that's Te Horo by Dulux

00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:10.721
My husband did the ceiling and I did the windows

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:11.681
which are always a nightmare

00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:14.481
and now I'm doing the second coat of the best creaming neutral I've ever met

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:15.990
this is half glinks gully by Dulux 

00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:17.801
and I'm using it right throughout my house

00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:19.401
and that is days 2 and 3 done

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:21.081
but there are still so much to do

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:22.559
so come back for the update
