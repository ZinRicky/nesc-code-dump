00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.240
I'm five in this picture

00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:04.201
and this is what I looked like when I started hating my body

00:00:04.202 --> 00:00:05.921
and thinking that I was too fat and

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.101
like wanting to lose weight and like

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.600
just not being comfortable myself

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.921
this is this is what I look like

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:11.841
this is what I look like

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:12.641
this is what I look like

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:16.001
when the adults around me started telling me that I needed to lose weight

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.041
this is what I look like

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:17.881
like of course yes

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:18.761
I was a chubby kid

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:20.961
but oh my god

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:25.081
looking back at these picture makes me genuinely want

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.060
I don't want my video to get taken down

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.040
but it makes me very angry

00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:33.241
because this little girl should have just been worried about ballet

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:34.761
been worried about being a child

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:37.561
she shouldn't have been so worried about her

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:40.401
but I remember this photo shoot and feeling bad

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:43.361
because the way this dress fit me compared to all the other little girl

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:45.241
I felt bad about myself and my body

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:47.601
like I'm a child I'm a child

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:49.561
my heart genuinely breaks for this little girl

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:52.681
because she deserved so much better than what she got

00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:53.981
like she's a kid

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.160
she's a child

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:57.261
I can't imagine now

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.160
at my grown age

00:00:58.161 --> 00:00:59.121
being an adult

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:02.881
looking at a child like this and commenting on her weight

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:06.401
I genuinely do not understand how you can see this little girl

00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:07.721
and the first thing you think is

00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:08.721
oh she's fat

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:10.921
I need to tell her she's fat and make her lose weight

00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:13.561
everything that I do now as an adult

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:17.641
I do because this little girl didn't have an adult like me in her life

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:19.641
she did not have one person in her life

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:21.041
at this age I was 5

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:23.081
6 maybe you're allowed to just exist in your body

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:23.961
nobody said that

00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:26.721
and that's why I do not care how much hate I get

00:01:26.722 --> 00:01:28.521
how many videos are made about me

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:29.481
how much shit is

00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:30.521
like thrown at

00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:33.201
I will not stop talking about Celebration

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:33.841
body positivity

00:01:33.842 --> 00:01:37.001
because this little girl needed someone like me in her life

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:37.881
and now as an adult

00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:38.879
that is all I wanna do
