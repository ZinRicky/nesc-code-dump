How are millennials making friends these days?

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.281
I genuinely have to know.

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:07.181
I don't understand the first thing it comes to making friends.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.400
I work from home. I'm at home.

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:14.061
The only time I go outdoors is if I go to the gym. Groceries.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.466
Do you guys. Do we have friends?
