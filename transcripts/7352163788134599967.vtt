00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:15.440
Mẹ ơi. Mẹ đã Vượt Biên để Con Có Thể Bay Cao Mẹ Vượt đại.

00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:18.421
Dương để Hôm Nay Con Chậm Cả Bầu Trời.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.500
That heritage inspired me to study the stars at Harvard and NASA.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.440
But I was raped

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:26.501
and found out that the government would destroy my evidence.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.820
At the crossroads of justice or my astronaut dreams,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.380
I chose justice.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.880
For 10 years,

00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:37.181
I traded my telescope for a pen to draft laws protecting survivors.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.460
Congress in the UN passed my legislation unanimously,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.980
impacting 1.3 billion people across the world.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.900
When I started my activism,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.740
I made a promise to myself.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.060
One day I would return.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.100
I didn't need to sacrifice who I am to do good

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.220
to the girl who has waited your life for this day.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.680
The girl I was before I was hurt

00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:03.201
and carried the hurt of millions of others.

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:05.641
I honour my promise to you.

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:06.981
We make it through.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.660
Your dreams matter.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.340
They come true.
