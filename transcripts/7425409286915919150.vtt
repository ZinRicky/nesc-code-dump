Here are my five hacks for having a good time at the fair this fall.

00:03.321 --> 00:04.641
Our family likes to go every year

00:04.642 --> 00:07.161
and the biggest thing is to wear comfy clothes

00:07.162 --> 00:09.001
so you can walk around and have a good time.

00:09.002 --> 00:11.281
When it comes to rides, download the Fun Pass app.

00:11.282 --> 00:13.361
You can see all of the rides that they have

00:13.362 --> 00:15.201
and how many tickets they cost.

00:15.202 --> 00:17.161
You can also buy tickets. Plan out your whole night.

00:17.162 --> 00:20.561
We were able to hit so many rides in just a couple hours.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.081
The next thing is to share food.

00:22.082 --> 00:23.921
That way you can try a little bit of everything.

00:23.922 --> 00:27.621
And if you go on Fridays, they have food items for $3 which was amazing.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.880
When you need to take a little break in between the rides and the food,

00:29.881 --> 00:31.881
be sure to check out the concerts they have going on

00:31.882 --> 00:33.561
as well as the petting zoo.

00:33.562 --> 00:36.241
My kids absolutely love seeing the animals.

00:36.242 --> 00:38.681
It was so much fun. If you really want to win a stuffed animal,

00:38.682 --> 00:40.801
try and find the games that are more off to the side

00:40.802 --> 00:42.801
that have less people. Or

00:42.802 --> 00:43.441
my favorite tip

00:43.442 --> 00:46.361
is to just go with a guy who is good at shooting basketballs

00:46.362 --> 00:48.201
and you can get a stuffed animal that way.

00:48.202 --> 00:51.441
I think the fair is so underrated and we had such a good time.

00:51.442 --> 00:52.849
Recommend 10 out of ten.
