00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.880
With everything going on with the Charleston Wine

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.960
and Food Festival this weekend,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.020
it was amazing to have the Moxie Hotel

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.840
host me for a stay overnight.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.600
I love a Charleston staycation,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.920
and the Moxie Hotel was so chic and fun.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.880
It was the perfect place to rest and relax

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.900
between events.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.360
The Moxie has an eclectic,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.040
cool, upscale vibe,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.840
which is perfect if you're heading to Charleston

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.000
for a fun weekend,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.060
a getaway, or even a staycation.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.240
It's in a great location

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.920
to some of my absolute favorite restaurants

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.820
like Pink Bellies and Melphy's.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.760
They were also hosting the media happy hour,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.400
so I jetted up to their sixth floor bar and lounge

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.120
to meet some of the other influencers

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.480
and media personnel that are

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.540
covering the Charleston Wine and Food Festival.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.880
The view from the rooftop is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.200
the best I've seen in Charleston.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.100
You can see the entire Ravenel Bridge.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.280
And their cocktails at the bar were incredible.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.800
Definitely a little hidden gem

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.800
if you're coming to Charleston

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.540
or if you just need a night away.
