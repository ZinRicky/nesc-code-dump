00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.520
you know I don't think that a man who evades questions

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.560
about how many abortions he's paid for

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:07.580
should be preventing other people from getting them right

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.520
Donald Trump values his right to privacy

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:12.200
he didn't wanna answer that question from Warren Dad when he was asked

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:15.200
why doesn't that right apply to other Americans and to all Americans

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.280
this isn't just an anti abortion agenda

00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:19.040
this is an anti sex agenda

00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:20.760
if you look at Project 2025

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.400
they don't just wanna restrict abortion

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.880
they want to ban pornography

00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:28.020
I have quotes here pornography should be outlawed

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.120
quote the people who produce and should be imprisoned for young women

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:33.720
young men right

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.560
who do not wanna see their sex lives regulated and wanna keep the

00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:37.780
keep their you know

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.200
internet browser private this isn't just control of women

00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:44.030
it's control of you too and men men are included
