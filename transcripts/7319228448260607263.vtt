00:00.080 --> 00:01.680
Here's everything I eat in a day.

00:01.680 --> 00:03.720
As someone that loves to cook

00:03.720 --> 00:05.920
and is also 26 weeks pregnant,

00:05.920 --> 00:07.360
I hate the taste of water.

00:07.360 --> 00:10.160
So today I made a mint and lemon water

00:10.160 --> 00:13.180
because I couldn't stomach drinking normal water.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.960
I also have been loving apple tea in the morning,

00:15.960 --> 00:17.240
so I've been having that.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.760
I had these leftover croissants,

00:18.760 --> 00:20.880
so I made a croissant bake.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.240
I put all my sliced croissants in a loaf pan

00:23.240 --> 00:25.820
and then made my heavy cream mixture,

00:26.000 --> 00:27.440
top my croissants with it,

00:27.440 --> 00:28.560
pop that in the oven.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.400
And it was so yummy.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.280
It was so hot.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.040
I couldn't wait,

00:32.040 --> 00:33.860
and I burnt all of my taste buds.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.040
I needed a little pick me up,

00:36.040 --> 00:36.760
as you guys know,

00:36.760 --> 00:37.360
before lunch.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.840
So I had a culture pop

00:38.840 --> 00:41.660
and then got started on my fish and chips.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.200
I wanted fish and chips,

00:43.200 --> 00:44.960
but I wanted something a lot lighter,

00:44.960 --> 00:47.240
so I opted to make a blanched

00:47.240 --> 00:49.160
vegetable salad instead of the chips

00:49.160 --> 00:50.360
and made my fish batter

00:50.360 --> 00:52.880
and also blanched my asparagus and edamame.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.360
Then I fried my fish,

00:54.360 --> 00:57.980
let it rest on a wire rack while I assembled my salad,

00:58.200 --> 00:59.400
plated that all up,

00:59.400 --> 01:00.560
added my kimchi

01:00.560 --> 01:02.080
dill aioli on the side,

01:02.080 --> 01:03.960
and this was so, so good.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.440
It was everything I wanted for dinner.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.240
I was craving birria tacos so bad,

01:09.240 --> 01:10.560
but I didn't wanna get take out,

01:10.560 --> 01:12.640
so I just decided to make them myself.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.840
I seared off my chuck roast in My pan

01:14.840 --> 01:16.080
got it brown on all sides,

01:16.080 --> 01:17.200
chopped up some onion,

01:17.200 --> 01:18.320
tomato, garlic,

01:18.320 --> 01:19.720
deseeded my chillies

01:19.720 --> 01:21.340
and pop that in as well.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.240
Then I blended it all up and added it back to the pot

01:24.240 --> 01:26.560
with my chuck roast and some herbs and stock.

01:26.560 --> 01:27.520
This was so good

01:27.520 --> 01:29.800
that I kept stealing bites here and there

01:29.800 --> 01:31.820
cause I just couldn't wait until dinner.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.320
But after three to four hours

01:33.320 --> 01:34.480
I pulled my meat out,

01:34.480 --> 01:35.440
shredded it up

01:35.440 --> 01:38.320
and then diced up some onion and cilantro

01:38.320 --> 01:40.280
and then started assembling my tacos.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.620
Dipped it in the consomme,

01:41.840 --> 01:43.200
added all my toppings.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.080
This was absolutely delicious.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.160
It was better than any takeout I could get.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.040
I've also been on a horchata kick,

01:49.040 --> 01:51.280
so lucky got us one while I was cooking this up

01:51.280 --> 01:53.825
and ended my night with some whipped cream and berries.
