00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.040
I remember wishing my mom would stop fucking cleaning

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.121
and just sit and watch a movie with me.

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.541
Or, like,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.640
how much I didn't care what we had for dinner.

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:16.661
But I would have loved to, um,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.740
tell her a story with her undivided attention.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.680
And, you know,

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.161
I've grown up to understand that she was giving me love

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:28.521
in the way that she thought that was best delivered.

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:32.281
But that's exactly why I left my miserable marriage.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:35.581
I decided I was not gonna stay for the kids.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.640
Because I wanted my kids to know me.

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:39.661
I didn't want.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.300
I didn't want them to have to wait until they were adults

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.020
to start to get to know me.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.920
To be able to ask me questions and get to know my actual opinions. And.

00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:49.361
Oh, mom,

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:50.561
I always thought you liked it this way.

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:51.881
No, we just always did it that way.

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:54.001
Cause the way we. We did it,

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:55.161
that's the way your father liked it.

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:57.381
I didn't want that. I wanted them to know me.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.100
I also felt like.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.020
I think a lot of times women are in a shitty relationship

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.680
and then they decide,

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:08.561
maybe if we just move on to the next phase of the relationship,

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:11.801
things will get better. And that next phase is usually marriage or, like,

00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:14.001
having a kid. And you kind of just think like, no, no, no.

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.801
All the problems will go away when we just, like,

00:01:16.802 --> 00:01:18.521
get to the goal. The point

00:01:18.522 --> 00:01:19.801
Of all this once we have the kids,

00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:21.761
once we get the house, once we do, like,

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:23.101
whatever ABC.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.920
And then you reach that point

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:26.921
and then the relationship still isn't better,

00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:28.961
and you're just getting more and more miserable and lonely.

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:29.481
But you just, like,

00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:31.121
keep holding on cause you're like, no,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.580
it'll. It'll get better.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.700
And you don't realize that you're like,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.720
all that happened was

00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:43.201
you were in a shitty relationship that you should have broken up with.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:45.161
Like, you guys should never have stayed together,

00:01:45.162 --> 00:01:46.481
but you kept pushing forward.

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:49.861
And now you've brought children into that shitty relationship,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.460
and you are kind of ignoring your children

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.040
to focus on that shitty relationship.

00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:58.521
And now you're using the kids as an excuse

00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:01.381
to make that relationship the focus of your life,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.260
when in reality, you just need to,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.560
if you wanna be a, like,

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:08.301
have a good relationship with your kids,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.460
drop the shitty relationship that has always been a source of, um,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.760
pain in your life. A consistent source of pain.

00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:21.041
Even if it brings you pleasure from time to time,

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:22.401
it's been a consistent source of pain.

00:02:22.402 --> 00:02:24.481
So you need to let go of that relationship

00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:26.641
so that you can focus on your kids.

00:02:26.642 --> 00:02:28.961
Cause I think it's really shitty to bring people into this world

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:30.081
and then be like, sorry,

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:32.161
I got other things I'm focusing on right now.

00:02:32.162 --> 00:02:35.601
I got this guy I've been trying to chase for 15,

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:36.441
20, Years

00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:37.361
and get him to, like,

00:02:37.362 --> 00:02:40.641
like me. So you guys are gonna have to fucking wait with, like,

00:02:40.642 --> 00:02:43.501
your needs and shit and your, like, development. Okay?

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.600
You know, that just seems kind of shitty.

00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:50.661
So I'm sorry that you didn't get a happy mom.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.560
And I'm trying my best to be a happy mom, to, like,

00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:56.321
pay it forward in the world,

00:02:56.322 --> 00:02:59.701
to honor women like you. So

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.780
I love you.
