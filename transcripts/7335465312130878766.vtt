00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.440
I'm a stay at home wife

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.840
and I get asked all the time,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.280
what does your husband do for you?

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.540
And I just felt so loved tonight that I had to share.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.840
I am in a production of beauty and the Beast

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.240
with my local community theater,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.760
and I have a three hour rehearsal

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.840
that I have to drive to town.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.360
To town is only 30 minutes away.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.720
But I've already been in town today.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.600
My car is in the shop,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.800
so it won't be my car,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.060
it's my husband's truck.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.240
And I just did not feel like driving into town

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.160
to go to that rehearsal.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.480
But I have to go to rehearsal

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.600
and I asked my husband, hey,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.420
would you mind to drive me into town?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.680
And my husband does not normally drive me into town.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.940
It's a three hour rehearsal,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.880
but he said yes.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.640
And I just feel so loved

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.560
that he would carve out that evening

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.760
to drive me to my rehearsal.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.320
He's not even spending time with me

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.120
except for the car ride there and back.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.520
But he's gonna stay in town,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.880
do a couple errands, and I.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.680
I just feel so loved.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.120
And for anyone who says

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.440
that's the bare minimum,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.040
my husband does so many things for me.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.960
He's had a long day at work today.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.040
There's no reason why he should drive me into town

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.000
except for the fact that he loves me. Anyway,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I just wanted to share that

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.220
because I love My husband and

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.730
I just wanted to give him a little shout out tonight.
