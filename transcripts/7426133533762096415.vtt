00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.840
Hey, do you know that Project 2025 might ban video games?

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:03.601
Uh, yeah, right.

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:05.061
That just scare tactics.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.320
They're actually talking about cracking down on degenerate culture.

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:09.821
And guess what's top of mine?

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.880
Your games? Come on,

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:12.881
they're not banning call of duty.

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:13.921
They wouldn't do that. Well,

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:16.961
they think that games like that are promoting violence and moral decay.

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:18.281
But hey, don't take my word for it.

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:21.401
They're actually talking about monitoring your media consumption.

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:22.881
Media consumption? You know,

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:24.801
stuff like tracking the games you buy,

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:26.321
the content that you watch.

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:29.881
Maybe check your social media posts for on American activity.

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:31.441
I despise my games. Noob.

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:32.801
They wouldn't do that. Oh,

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:33.921
but they love surveillance.

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:34.281
I mean,

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:37.321
imagine them accessing your game history to see what you're playing.

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:40.001
Maybe flag if you're playing anything too violent or,

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:41.801
I don't know, Liberal.

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.621
Like Zelda. Zelda

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.200
what? Oh,

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:46.841
and let's not forget internet usage.

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:48.481
They might actually start tracking that too.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:51.361
You know, just to protect you from dangerous influences,

00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:53.001
like what sites you're visiting.

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:54.761
You know, if they're going to ban porn,

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:56.761
they're going to have to enforce that somehow.

00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:58.641
By spying on you. Doesn't matter to me, dude.

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:01.281
I don't even eat corn, let alone watch it.

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:04.561
Well, project 2025 is all about controlling immoral behavior.

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:07.361
Nothing's off the table if it doesn't fit with their agenda.

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:11.001
So they could just watch what I do on my phone at night

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.041
and in the morning? Yeah,

00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:14.761
they sure can. I Thought this was about,

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:16.281
you know, freedom of choice.

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:18.841
Sure, as long as your choices match with their values.

00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:20.661
Otherwise, they'll be right there watching
