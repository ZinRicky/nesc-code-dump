00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.320
Lately, I've been feeling this huge shift in energy

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:06.161
and this desire to simplify my life.

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:07.481
And I don't know if this is a reaction

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.601
to everything that's kind of going on in the news

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:12.561
and in the world, and with the election and all this stuff.

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:14.401
Just. It feels very unstable.

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:15.541
And I think

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.220
me and my husband have been talking a lot about simplifying our life,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.480
kind of insulating, changing a chapter.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.021
Potentially leaving Charleston.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.560
We couldn't go too far because my husband owns a business in the area,

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:32.281
so we couldn't be that far away.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.361
But where we live now is really busy.

00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:36.721
We've watched the city change a lot.

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:39.201
And as much as we still love Charleston,

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:43.741
I think we're kind of feeling that time of our lives shift.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.160
But what I find really interesting is we're feeling at the same time,

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:48.241
we both feel this push.

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:51.421
We don't know what the right direction to take is,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.360
but we know that something has to give.

00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:55.761
What? The lifestyle that we're living right now is unsustainable.

00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:57.661
And I don't necessarily just mean financially.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.240
The driving, a co ops,

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.481
the activities, him working like crazy,

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:04.701
everything just feels like a little bit too much right now.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.600
Um, and we wanna kind of pair it back.

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.721
Like, look at what's really important to us,

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:10.521
look at the things that we wanna accomplish,

00:01:10.522 --> 00:01:12.201
look at the lifestyle we wanna lead.

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:16.961
And with that comes this big sense of, like, anxiety.

00:01:16.962 --> 00:01:19.161
Because we don't know the right thing to do right now.

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.441
So one of the things I did,

00:01:20.442 --> 00:01:21.681
because I was getting really overwhelmed

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:22.681
with the homeschooling schedule,

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:26.481
is I took my kids out of co op just for December and January,

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:27.001
just for, like,

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:27.921
the two winter months.

00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:30.321
They weren't even really gonna be in person anyway in January

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:32.781
because it's so cold, and they do it mostly outside.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.200
So we're taking a break from that.

00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:37.681
And I wrote down a schedule for my days with my kids

00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:38.761
with homeschooling at home,

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:40.641
and I've gotten this, like,

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:44.501
huge sense of peace from it and productivity,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.720
and the kids are also not as hectic and stressed,

00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:49.001
and it's. It's actually been really great so far.

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:49.921
And another thing is,

00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:53.701
I've taken a huge step back from certain personal relationships.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.080
Um, if you've been following me a long time,

00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.781
you know that my family has gone through a lot of UPS and downs with,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.200
you know, toxic family structures and generational healing.

00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:07.041
My mom is now starting her journey

00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:09.201
of dealing with her generational trauma

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:10.181
from her mother,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.560
which she so lovingly passed down to the three sisters,

00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:16.261
me and my two sisters, so.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.560
And I've always kind of been there and walked with everyone through it,

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:20.401
and they, you know,

00:02:20.402 --> 00:02:22.941
certain members of my family have walked with me through mine.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.400
But I'm taking a giant step back from the, like,

00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:28.801
emotional labor of it. And again,

00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:32.281
I've gotten this Huge sense of calm and peace from it,

00:02:32.282 --> 00:02:38.601
because I don't feel a sense of expectation on me anymore.

00:02:38.602 --> 00:02:39.561
And I always have.

00:02:39.562 --> 00:02:43.361
I've always tried to meet these expectations and perform in some way.

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:46.101
Um, so I've been taking a step back,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.800
but I've always been in tune.

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:48.841
I've always been in tune.

00:02:48.842 --> 00:02:51.081
Me and my husband have always been aligned with our, like,

00:02:51.082 --> 00:02:56.041
vision and our feelings and our desires for change when we want change

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:57.981
and desires to hunker when we wanna hunker.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.520
So

00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:01.441
both of us are feeling the push for a change and a chapter difference

00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:04.121
and really re evaluating things.

00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:05.521
And I don't know where it's gonna lead,

00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:07.581
but something's brewing.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.040
Something is pushing us in a different direction.

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:12.401
You can call it god, you can call it fate,

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:14.441
you can call it instinct, um,

00:03:14.442 --> 00:03:17.941
but we have the tangles, and I'm interested to see how this shakes out.
