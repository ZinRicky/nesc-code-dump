00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.960
One of my most frequently asked questions is,

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.701
where do you get all of your gorgeous dresses?

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.000
Hi all. Victoria,

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.421
late here. Self proclaimed tribewife.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.640
They say if the shoe fits,

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:11.361
then wear it. So

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:14.041
I'm gonna be sharing with y'all my favorite milk made

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:16.321
inspired dresses. Triedwife approved.

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:18.321
This is my new favorite one.

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:20.541
Floral, kind of cinched waist,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.580
white. Floral.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.080
Perfect for summer, but honestly perfect for anytime.

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.841
And look at this dress. Loose and flowy,

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:30.441
cinches at the waist, compliments the bust.

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:33.401
Has a little tie here so you can tighten it or loosen it.

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:34.961
This is my favorite dress.

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:38.281
It is like Chef's kiss. Literally,

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:41.641
if I go out in this, I know everybody's head is turning.

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:43.801
Now here is another lovely dress.

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:45.561
Probably throw a sweater over it.

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:48.141
This is probably how I would wear it.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.520
Super cute, but floral white.

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.401
I love it. Here's another dress.

00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:56.921
This one is a little loud for me.

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:58.641
It has red even though it's white,

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:02.881
and it has floral. This is one that I probably won't reach for as much,

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:04.441
but it cinches at the waist,

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:05.881
loose and flowy at the bottom.

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:09.041
Okay, here's another dress that is truly the perfect headed me.

00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:10.721
A very soft, feminine.

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:12.881
You could dress this up or dress it down.

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:13.961
Wear it with tennis shoes.

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:16.921
I like to wear heels, throw over a sweater,

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:20.201
and then it makes it look a little more judged up,

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:23.901
if you know what I mean. Very Complimenting light, floral.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.760
That's a good dress. Okay,

00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:27.721
last, but certainly not least,

00:01:27.722 --> 00:01:31.761
is this a little milk made inspired dress?

00:01:31.762 --> 00:01:35.621
I would say this is 100% triadwife approved.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.960
It just gives you a cute little baby doll look

00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:39.321
with the puffed up sleeves,

00:01:39.322 --> 00:01:44.341
stitching at the waist. It just looks so pretty and girly.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.966
Makes you just want to go in the kitchen and cook a five course meal.
