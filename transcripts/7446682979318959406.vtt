00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.160
Oh my god, you're such a trad wife.

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:05.001
You're so demeaning on tik tok teaching women to be trad wives.

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:08.701
What is y'all's obsession with hating on trad wives?

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.760
Trad wife is just a buzz word for a traditional wife slash mom.

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:17.621
It kills me that this is even part of the debate on social media.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.000
Am I a trad wife? My answer is absolutely yes,

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.481
I am. Do I cook and clean for my husband?

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.761
Heck yes. Do I make sure my face is done

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:28.801
by the time he comes home from a long day of work

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:30.681
so he has something pretty to look at?

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:34.881
Yes. Do I rub his feet when he spent nine days planting at the farm?

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:39.001
Yes. Do I try to prioritize his happiness when he's home from work?

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:42.041
Yes. Do I serve him in and out of the bedroom?

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.201
Yes. But see,

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:45.661
all y'all are looking at this like a sacrifice,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.760
like I'm giving up my entire existence to serve this patriarchal man.

00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:53.281
Let me tell you what I get in return.

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:57.681
Most importantly, I get the ability to stay home with my children

00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:01.441
without having to clock in to an 8 to 5 at a corporate office

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:05.121
working for a man who doesn't give two craps about who I am

00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:07.041
or my future or my family

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:08.021
or my well being.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.640
I get a partner who equally puts me on a pedestal in different ways.

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:14.041
I get a roof over my head,

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:17.041
food to Feed both my children and my own belly.

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.401
And I get equity in our business.

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:21.941
Yeah, I'm not just out here working for a salary

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.600
for something that I could lose if they find out I'm not valuable

00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:28.601
the next day. I am my husband's partner.

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:30.881
Not just ethically and morally and in his eyes,

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:33.441
in the laws eyes, but most importantly,

00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:35.681
he treats me like a partner.

00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:39.721
He comes home every day and tells me how important what I'm doing is.

00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:41.361
He makes me feel valued.

00:01:41.362 --> 00:01:44.641
He lets me know that he would not be able to do anything

00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:45.761
that he is doing right now,

00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:47.401
creating and growing our business,

00:01:47.402 --> 00:01:50.161
if it was not for me taking on my gender roles.

00:01:50.162 --> 00:01:51.041
Oh, gender roles.

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:56.081
Another buzz word. By taking care of our children that we both love,

00:01:56.082 --> 00:02:01.301
taking care of our house, making sure that our home is a sanctuary.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.560
And listen, I'm not just in charge of, like,

00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:06.441
cooking and cleaning and other deeds, right?

00:02:06.442 --> 00:02:10.821
What women do is create the culture of our family.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.960
And the culture of those boys sleeping in their cribs right now.

00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:18.521
Because what I do will teach them what to do with their wives

00:02:18.522 --> 00:02:19.361
when they're older.

00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:23.681
They will take on my traditions and what I value when they're older.

00:02:23.682 --> 00:02:25.141
Yeah, it's indoctrination,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.480
but they're not being indoctrinated by the government in school,

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.721
they're not in daycare. And all the sacrifices I do right now,

00:02:31.722 --> 00:02:35.561
before the age of three, I do A lot of work, guys.

00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:37.841
Everything we talk about here in attachment theory,

00:02:37.842 --> 00:02:40.001
it's a lot of work. But guess what?

00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:42.621
I am making sure I create the best foundation

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.720
so that they don't end up on our couch at the age of 35.

00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:50.621
So that they can be successful and have a really good relationships

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.600
and merge into the world as they need to.

00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:53.681
Because at the end of the day,

00:02:53.682 --> 00:02:55.481
we're not of this world, but we are in it.

00:02:55.482 --> 00:02:59.281
And they have to function as real men in this society.

00:02:59.282 --> 00:03:01.941
Something I believe we truly lack nowadays

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.480
is really your selection of a man.

00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:07.641
So I take what I do very seriously,

00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:09.121
and you should, too, Mama.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:12.361
Every decision you make, everything we do,

00:03:12.362 --> 00:03:14.601
dictates the future. Not just of our family,

00:03:14.602 --> 00:03:16.041
of our sons, of our daughters,

00:03:16.042 --> 00:03:17.681
but of our nation.

00:03:17.682 --> 00:03:21.961
But so many of us just sit here and complain about how bad men are.

00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:23.701
So I'm not gonna sit here and complain.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.880
Even when my husband drives me up the wall,

00:03:25.881 --> 00:03:27.341
I'm gonna lift him up,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.480
and I'm gonna make sure that my boys are lifted up,

00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:34.161
and they are the princes of the next generation.

00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:34.601
So, yeah,

00:03:34.602 --> 00:03:37.841
I take what I do seriously as a trad wife or a trad mom.

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:38.801
Because at the end of the day,

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.981
I dictate that next generation.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.400
I am the king, creator.

00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:46.401
So I'm not up here crapping on women.

00:03:46.402 --> 00:03:49.081
I'm here to tell you that your Job is freaking important.

00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:51.241
And so all this discourse talking about, oh,

00:03:51.242 --> 00:03:54.601
Chad wives, and it's so patriarchal B S.

00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:57.521
Our job is so freaking valuable.

00:03:57.522 --> 00:03:58.361
So, yeah,

00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:00.921
I am a Chad wife, and I take it seriously.

00:04:00.922 --> 00:04:04.561
And I'm honored to be a mother of those two boys.

00:04:04.562 --> 00:04:07.801
And I am honored to be a wife to my badass man.

00:04:07.802 --> 00:04:10.261
That is my rant on tried wives.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.020
Thanks for coming to my TikTok.
