Husband has been loving Snickers bars

00:01.801 --> 00:03.281
and when he was craving one today

00:03.282 --> 00:06.041
I just decided to make him a batch myself.

00:06.042 --> 00:09.561
Started off by making some peanut butter by just blending up some dry

00:09.562 --> 00:10.601
roasted peanuts.

00:10.602 --> 00:11.801
Once that was all smooth,

00:11.802 --> 00:14.361
I set that aside and got started on my new GOT.

00:14.362 --> 00:16.201
I combined all of my ingredients,

00:16.202 --> 00:20.481
which were sugar and water, and let that come to a boil on the stove.

00:20.482 --> 00:21.601
While that was boiling,

00:21.602 --> 00:23.761
I separated my egg whites from my yolks

00:23.762 --> 00:26.681
and made sure to have them come up to room temperature

00:26.682 --> 00:30.121
before whipping them until medium stiff peaks were forming.

00:30.122 --> 00:31.161
Once that was the case,

00:31.162 --> 00:34.221
I took my sugar mixture off the stove and slowly

00:34.440 --> 00:36.120
poured it into the egg whites

00:36.121 --> 00:40.261
and mixed it on medium high speed until it turned into a marshmallow

00:40.280 --> 00:41.340
fluff consistency.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.960
Then I spooned it out onto my baking sheet

00:43.961 --> 00:45.601
and realized that it was a little big,

00:45.602 --> 00:48.481
so I transferred it over to my square baking dish.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.521
Once it was pressed down,

00:49.522 --> 00:51.921
I popped it in the fridge for about five hours

00:51.922 --> 00:53.781
before starting on my caramel.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.440
I combined some sugar and salt,

00:55.441 --> 00:57.361
let that melt on the stove.

00:57.362 --> 00:59.081
Once it reached this amber color,

00:59.082 --> 01:01.721
I whisked in some heavy cream and butter.

01:01.722 --> 01:03.481
Then I incorporated some peanuts

01:03.482 --> 01:05.521
and let that cool slightly on the stove

01:05.522 --> 01:07.881
before pouring it over my set nougat.

01:07.882 --> 01:10.361
I turned my baking dish to the fridge for the caramel

01:10.362 --> 01:12.761
to set for another 30 to 45 minutes

01:12.762 --> 01:14.561
while I melted some chocolate.

01:14.562 --> 01:16.841
Then it was time to dip my bars in the chocolate.

01:16.842 --> 01:18.361
So I pulled it out the fridge,

01:18.362 --> 01:20.721
cut it into 12 equal pieces

01:20.722 --> 01:23.961
before taking one of them and dipping it in the chocolate

01:23.962 --> 01:27.121
and letting it cool down on a wire rack in the fridge.

01:27.122 --> 01:28.881
And there we had our Snickers bar.

01:28.882 --> 01:31.081
Lucky was so surprised at how good they were,

01:31.082 --> 01:33.341
and he definitely approved.
