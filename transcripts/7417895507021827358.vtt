00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.960
As a homeschool mom, there are a few things that I always have on hand,

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.001
one of them being air dry modeling clay.

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:07.081
I love to use these for so many different activities.

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:09.361
And I found this pack of 24 on the TikTok shop.

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:10.601
It's got so many different colors,

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:12.481
and my daughter is so excited to try these out.

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:13.561
Okay, obviously,

00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:15.121
Maverick is really excited to use these two.

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:17.081
So there are 24 different colors,

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:20.041
and I like them because they can really get creative.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:22.281
Today we're gonna use these as a reading comprehension activity.

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:23.801
We just did a little bit of our read aloud,

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:26.241
and I'm going to have them make the characters,

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:27.681
which are little foxes,

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.441
and they're gonna use the mine clay to make them.

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:31.601
I just opened the pack, and it comes with little tools

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:33.421
that they can use to make their creations

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.480
and also these bags to reseal.

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:36.681
I was a little bit concerned about this,

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:37.881
so I'm so thankful that they include these.

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:40.241
You can use up the clay and then slide them right in here

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:41.921
so they stay air tight and they won't dry out.

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:43.441
There's also this little users manual

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.241
that has different things that they can make,

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:48.041
which I love. And I think the letters is a great idea,

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:50.241
especially if you have an early learner who is just getting

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:51.761
start with the letters. And this would be a really fun activity

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:53.685
to practice letter formation and letter sounds.
