00:00.120 --> 00:01.400
Let's do our makeup together

00:01.400 --> 00:03.040
while I tell you a few facts about me.

00:03.040 --> 00:05.120
Because there's so many new people on here.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.600
So. Hi, everyone.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.000
My full name is Nora Aziza Smith.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.160
I was born on September 27th, 2,001.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.800
So I'm 22 years old,

00:14.800 --> 00:16.300
and I'm a Libra.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.280
I was born in Bloemfontein,

00:18.280 --> 00:19.160
South Africa.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.720
My mom's South African and my dad's German.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.120
And we moved to Germany

00:23.120 --> 00:24.960
when I was about three months old.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.860
Because I guess they wanted me to grow up in Germany.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.280
I've lived in Freifor,

00:29.280 --> 00:31.000
Germany, my entire life.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.080
We never moved.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.840
And I speak two languages.

00:33.840 --> 00:34.720
English and German.

00:34.720 --> 00:35.560
Dutch on English,

00:35.560 --> 00:36.600
then vitamin and motosh.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.200
Pothom. Then

00:38.200 --> 00:40.000
as soon as I turned 18,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.120
I moved to California,

00:42.120 --> 00:44.300
even though I've never been before.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.320
I'm the oldest of three siblings.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.320
I have a younger sister who's 18,

00:48.320 --> 00:51.100
and then I have a younger brother who's twenty.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.520
I also have a half brother on my mom's side

00:54.520 --> 00:55.880
who lives in South Africa.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.320
When I was 14,

00:57.320 --> 00:59.520
I got scouted by a modeling agency.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.840
And I've been doing modeling ever since then.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.980
That's also how I met my husband.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.320
After six months of dating,

01:06.320 --> 01:07.880
we got married

01:07.880 --> 01:09.840
and then had two kids

01:09.840 --> 01:11.620
and were pregnant with our third.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.200
We have a daughter.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.440
Her name is rumble.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.680
And we have a son.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.140
His name is slim.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.760
My husband also has a daughter

01:18.760 --> 01:20.820
from his previous relationship.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.200
I've always wanted to be a young mom

01:23.200 --> 01:24.120
because growing up,

01:24.120 --> 01:24.880
my dad would

01:24.880 --> 01:27.720
Always tell us that he regrets having kids

01:27.720 --> 01:28.980
later in life.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.480
So I took that advice,

01:30.480 --> 01:32.760
and it's one of the best decisions I could have made,

01:32.760 --> 01:34.640
and I know it's not for everyone.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.320
I was always very mature and independent

01:37.320 --> 01:40.260
and did a lot of things at a very young age.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.560
So I never feel like I'm missing out on

01:42.560 --> 01:43.680
any of the partying,

01:43.680 --> 01:44.200
any of that,

01:44.200 --> 01:46.060
because I've done all of that.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.800
I grew up playing a lot of instruments,

01:48.800 --> 01:49.800
from the saxophone

01:49.800 --> 01:50.400
to the flute

01:50.400 --> 01:51.160
to the piano,

01:51.160 --> 01:55.400
but I ended up playing the piano for about eight years.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.880
I think I also worked at a smoothie shop

01:58.880 --> 02:00.120
while I was in high school.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.320
I was just so slow

02:01.320 --> 02:03.820
that no one really wanted to work with me,

02:03.960 --> 02:06.260
so I got overwhelmed and quit.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.120
I'm a very routine,

02:09.120 --> 02:10.560
organized person,

02:10.560 --> 02:13.960
so I do not do well if I'm not on a routine or.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.200
When I finished high school,

02:15.200 --> 02:18.640
my plan was to study marine biology,

02:18.640 --> 02:20.680
but my plan shifted,

02:20.680 --> 02:22.880
and now I'm cooking a lot more

02:22.880 --> 02:24.160
and being on social media.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.680
I know that my religion is a very hot topic

02:26.680 --> 02:27.360
on the internet.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.160
I don't know what I'm doing.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.060
I'm still learning and figuring out my own faith.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.500
I'm not in any way a hardcore Mormon

02:35.640 --> 02:37.160
or anything like that.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.200
I don't wear garments.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.100
I didn't get married in the temple.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.920
Both me and my husband are on our own journeys

02:42.920 --> 02:45.620
and figuring out how we Want to raise our kids.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.520
I've always loved cooking,

02:48.520 --> 02:50.260
but I just recently,

02:50.440 --> 02:51.520
in the past year,

02:51.520 --> 02:53.620
have gotten really passionate about it.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.800
It all started when I was dealing with

02:56.800 --> 02:58.120
really severe eczema,

02:58.120 --> 03:00.960
and I had to make sure that what I put in my body

03:00.960 --> 03:02.240
would be good for my body.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.640
And that's kind of how I got into nutrition

03:04.640 --> 03:06.620
and food and cooking

03:08.680 --> 03:12.520
also. My regular lip combo is MAC lip liner and Cork,

03:12.520 --> 03:13.940
and then I either do

03:14.080 --> 03:16.820
the benetint or the beneflora in the middle.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.960
And then sometimes I do a gloss on top,

03:18.960 --> 03:23.700
or I do the Brown Summer Fridays Dream lip oil.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.040
I line my lips,

03:25.040 --> 03:26.440
and then I go in with this.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.360
I've also never gotten anything done to my face.

03:29.360 --> 03:31.280
A lot of people think I've gotten lip filler,

03:31.280 --> 03:32.780
which I have not.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.660
And there we go.
