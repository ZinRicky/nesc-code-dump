00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.240
This is funny cause I've been to fat camp twice in my life.

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:04.241
The first time I was 8 years old, turning 9.

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:06.361
I had my 9th birthday at fat camp.

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:08.921
And instead of cake like any normal 9 year old,

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:13.641
I had a watermelon with a lemon on top in the shape of a pig

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:17.061
and like a bunch of like nut and honey balls instead of cookies.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.480
That was it. That was.

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:19.441
That was my ninth birthday.

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:20.161
I was nine years old,

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:21.561
I was in the mountains of Bulgaria,

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:24.681
and we were surviving off of basically a diet of fruits and tea.

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:26.681
And that was it for maybe three weeks.

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:28.081
I don't remember much of it the first time,

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:30.561
but the second time I did it, I was 16 years old, um,

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:31.721
and I did for about,

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:33.861
I don't know, three weeks. And I lost,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.800
I don't know, 15 kg,

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:36.561
something like that.

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:39.361
So yeah, in that three weeks or so that I starved myself,

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:40.241
I definitely lost weight.

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:40.721
Right?

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:44.341
The second that I re entered society and I like, was a person again,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.640
all that weight came back is like, it's not sustainable.

00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:49.161
Like, the problem with dieting is not that it's like

00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:49.921
you're not gonna lose weight.

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:51.001
Sure, you can lose weight.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:54.761
The problem is most people will gain back what they lose and then some.

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:56.161
That's problem with yo yo dieting,

00:00:56.162 --> 00:00:58.201
because like, whatever weight you start at,

00:00:58.202 --> 00:01:00.681
the likelihood is that you're gonna gain All the weight that you lost

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:02.001
and then more,

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:04.601
so you're gonna end up at a higher weight than you started off with.

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:05.884
That's the problem with yo yo, dieting
