00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.600
I heard a lot growing up of, like,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.560
how people know you're a Christian if you.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.000
If you wear women's pants or if you cut your hair,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.960
if you wear makeup.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.740
It's like, the Holy Spirit.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.160
Are you really that close minded?

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.240
And you put everything in a box

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.520
and you put god in a box that he won't dwell in you

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.920
and he won't work through you

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.600
and he won't speak through you.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.280
Because he is so good.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.680
Is he not magnificent?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.680
Is he not holy?

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.300
Is he not all knowing?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.560
Like, that's so wild to me

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.540
that I thought that I had to look so different

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.840
to be set apart.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.400
It's like, no,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.160
the Holy Spirit has already set me apart.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.957
I am set apart because I am a child of god. Period.
