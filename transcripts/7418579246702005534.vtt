00:00.440 --> 00:06.460
A few days ago, we lost our beloved milk cow, Tulip.

00:07.760 --> 00:10.220
It was sudden and unexpected.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.560
She was her happy self one day,

00:12.561 --> 00:16.941
and the next morning, we woke up to her passed away in the pasture.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.200
To say we weren't ready is an understatement,

00:20.201 --> 00:22.761
because Tulip has been a huge part of our life

00:22.762 --> 00:26.381
since the very beginning days of our farming journey.

00:27.760 --> 00:28.960
When I think about Tulip,

00:28.961 --> 00:33.121
I'm reminded of our morning and night milkings

00:33.122 --> 00:35.141
that we've had these past years

00:35.360 --> 00:40.340
as my kids and I and all of us would gather around her to milk her.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.520
And whether or not the kids were fighting or in a bad mood,

00:44.521 --> 00:47.481
whenever they would get underneath her and start milking,

00:47.482 --> 00:51.601
they would start to talk. There would be a spirit of peace,

00:51.602 --> 00:54.781
of camaraderie. Our troubles,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.960
it sounds silly, but they would kind of melt away.

00:57.961 --> 01:02.341
Tulip taught me and Daniel and all our babies how to be farmers.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.320
She was there from the very beginning of their lives until now.

01:06.321 --> 01:08.821
They were so gentle and so calm

01:08.840 --> 01:11.460
that I knew my kids were safe around her.

01:11.480 --> 01:17.260
They Learned how to. To walk animals and push cows and shut gates.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.320
But when she was done with kiddos,

01:19.321 --> 01:21.781
she was done. You couldn't change your mind.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.800
But she was a cow that didn't need a halter.

01:24.801 --> 01:27.841
So we could come up to her wherever she was in the pasture,

01:27.842 --> 01:30.961
and we could milk her. And she would just stand and

01:30.962 --> 01:33.801
Wait until you're completely finished milking,

01:33.802 --> 01:35.461
and then she would go on her way.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.600
I also love that in the very coldest of winters,

01:39.601 --> 01:41.501
in the mornings and the night,

01:42.240 --> 01:47.120
she would gather us all together and get us outside.

01:47.121 --> 01:51.021
She was so calm. All our chaos here on the farm.

01:51.320 --> 01:55.000
In fact, when we got our cows at the dairy a few months ago,

01:55.001 --> 01:57.441
we walked her down to see if she would like it,

01:57.442 --> 02:00.981
to see what she thought. And within a few hours,

02:01.240 --> 02:04.060
Miss Tulip was back in our front pasture.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.920
So that we could see her and milk her everyday.

02:07.921 --> 02:09.561
Because that's where she belonged.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.221
We're going to miss her terribly.
