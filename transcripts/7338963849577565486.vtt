00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.500
okay but no have you actually tried dating

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.320
because I sometimes don't understand why these men think that

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.241
it's so they could invite you back to their place

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:13.001
you go back to their place and you're like sir

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:14.961
how have you washed your ass ever

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:16.761
there's not a drop of soap in this place

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:23.081
I know you're not using that joy dishwashing liquid to wash your hands

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:24.581
your ass and your dishes

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.960
but usually that's the only fucking soap you'll find

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:27.961
that orange shit

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:29.301
not even the cadon

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.220
usually they don't have shit up on their walls

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.780
they think you're gonna be that distracted by the

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.660
that you're gonna like

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.240
it's a bit of a shit show out there

00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:47.821
I'm glad I found a real one a good one so far

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.580
keep you know what I mean

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.880
and and actually there's a lot of dudes that don't even have a place

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:56.321
and I don't mean they live with their mom

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.561
cause no shame in like

00:00:57.562 --> 00:00:59.001
multi generational living

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:00.361
that's a thing it's real

00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:02.561
it's valid and it's

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.721
it's beautiful and it's

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:05.761
you know the way the world is going right now

00:01:05.762 --> 00:01:08.121
it makes a lot of sense for the multi generational living

00:01:08.122 --> 00:01:09.721
if it's truly like a multi

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:12.801
generally generational living thing where he's contributing

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:13.821
and this is a big

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.460
you know a little home of family of people

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.200
generally speaking

00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:20.541
they're homeless

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.320
and just trying to get with you because they want a place to stay

00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:25.401
it's real quick

00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:26.781
easy to spot them

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.840
they're gonna shower you with love and compliments

00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:32.841
and fall in love with you really fast

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:38.001
and suddenly have some need to just stay your place for a couple days

00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:39.641
or maybe they help you move and they just

00:01:39.642 --> 00:01:41.201
like never leave

00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:45.081
but somehow they're like a little fucking vampire and they watch on

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:46.281
and then they don't leave

00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:47.841
so usually they're homeless

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:48.921
if they're not homeless

00:01:48.922 --> 00:01:50.521
they have a place and it has

00:01:50.522 --> 00:01:51.321
like a couch

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:52.821
one spoon and

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.040
like that's it

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:55.961
then mustard

00:01:55.962 --> 00:01:57.261
maybe if you're lucky

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.300
so yeah I was very very

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.200
very impressed at my boyfriend's house when I went

00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:05.621
and he's literally so

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.760
good luck out there

00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:07.551
ladies good luck
