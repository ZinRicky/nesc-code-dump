00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.060
Our NDP government is following through on our commitment.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.900
Free birth control will be available in Manitoba

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.500
beginning on October 1st.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.380
Our government will cover the prescription birth control costs

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.560
for pills, IUDs,

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:23.801
injections for anyone who has a prescription from a doctor

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:25.821
or another healthcare provider.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.140
We know that over a lifetime,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.780
birth control can cost thousands of dollars.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.820
This announcement today is about reproductive justice.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.840
Free birth control gives women,

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:42.261
girls and gender diverse folks freedom,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.860
the freedom to determine their paths that their lives take

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.180
and the opportunity to live their best lives.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.820
And in a world where reproductive rights are increasingly threatened,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.140
our government's announcement today affirms reproductive healthcare

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.860
as a human right

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.520
and as a means of empowerment and liberation for Manitoba women,

00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:11.221
girls and gender diverse folks.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.240
Today and always,

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:17.881
our government continues to affirm the reproductive rights of women

00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:19.301
and all Manitobans.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.120
Today's announcement will ensure that all Manitobans in need

00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:24.561
will have access to reliable contraception

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:27.901
and secures their ability to make a reproductive life plan.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.640
And it further empowers women to make decisions around their education

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.921
and careers that are solely based on their own hopes and dreams

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:37.061
and not around unintended pregnancies.
