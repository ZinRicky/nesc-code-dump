00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
I just wanted to show the reality of what it's like to have POTS,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.200
especially for me being pregnant with POTS.

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.401
Being pregnant makes my POTS worse.

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:10.921
So just to give an idea of what's going on here,

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:12.041
I've been standing in the kitchen,

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:15.001
I've been cooking. I'm not walking on a treadmill,

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.401
I'm not doing squats, really.

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:19.201
Quite just easy stuff.

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:21.521
Um, as I'm talking to you,

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:22.841
I'm getting a little out of breath here,

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:23.361
but anyway,

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:26.881
I was standing in the kitchen cooking for the past 15 ish minutes. Here.

00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:30.161
You can see my heart rate is about 160

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:32.061
just from standing here talking to you.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.700
Um, the 99 is my oxygen levels.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.360
So this is what happens when you have POTS,

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:41.441
is standing often causes your heart to race.

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:43.241
And even just standing and cooking,

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.941
even though I'm not doing anything strenuous,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.540
is causing my heart to race.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.240
A lot of women have shamed me

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:50.341
for not being able to do my dishes while pregnant,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.760
and this is the reason why I can't do my dishes.

00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:55.161
The heat makes POTS worse,

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:58.561
so people with POTS generally struggle more in the summertime

00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:01.281
in the shower. It's very common for people with POTS

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:03.561
to not be able to shower without a shower stool

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:08.161
because the heat causes the blood to rush to our feet even more.

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:11.081
I would be standing at the sink with hot water running,

00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:14.401
overheating, and my heart rate running at about a hundred,

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:16.741
sixty hundred, Sixty five for the duration.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.920
And I don't know about you,

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:24.321
but I can't have my heart rate at 160 for a long amount of time

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:25.881
before my legs start shaking

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:27.961
and I start to feel dizzy and lightheaded.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:30.073
So that's why I can't do my dishes.
