00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.320
I'm gonna ruffle a few teacher feathers when I say this

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:04.080
but I don't think it's that important

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.340
to teach my little kids to tell time on an analog clock yet

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.480
just hear me out there is a lot of other things that come with a concept of time

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:12.640
like an hour a minute morning afternoon

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:13.800
night am PM

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.120
those kinds of things and telling time on an analog clock

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:17.320
it takes a lot of additional skills

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:19.720
like skip counting and for my littles

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:21.920
they just don't have all of those skills mastered yet

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.580
so it makes telling time really difficult

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.600
but I did find this time to fly game

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:29.940
that has been so good in helping them practice those concepts

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.460
and learn how to tell time on an analogue clock

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.960
because it has this little airplane that helps teach them the correct time

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:42.800
and is a self corrector so there are these little cards that have a time

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:46.320
they have to be able to read it and make the time on the analog clock

00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:49.140
and they can play independently because this checks their time for them

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.720
so if you are teaching littles to tell time

00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:54.780
or just want to practice tell time at home or in the costume

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.622
time to fly is a great way to do that
