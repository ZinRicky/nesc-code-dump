00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.280
Here's some foods I made today to make sure we have food for the week.

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:05.641
I cut my sourdough into eight equal pieces,

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:07.761
then shaped them into small English muffin rounds

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.921
and allowed them to rise for two hours before cooking them in a pan.

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:13.401
I had been sprouting walnuts for the past 24 hours,

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:16.121
so I rinse these and put them in the dehydrator to crisp up.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.360
I washed some NYX minimalized corn that had been soaking all night

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:21.341
and made a big batch of fresh masa

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.880
using a Molino to grind the corn into a dough.

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.241
I made some pumpkin muffins which the kids loved,

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:27.761
but I wasn't happy with the texture,

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:29.481
so I'll be making these again soon.

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:32.161
I made some sourdough cinnamon rolls which had fermented overnight.

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:33.641
The dough was so nice and soft

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:36.561
and I spread cinnamon butter all over it before letting it rise again.

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:39.401
Then I spread a homemade cream cheese frosting over top.

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:41.761
I batched out two zucchini lasagnas.

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:43.801
These are low in carbs and high in protein.

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:46.241
Made a big batch of hamburger for quick snacks,

00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:48.361
a garden fresh salad for quick lunches,

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:51.881
and a Mayo dressing. Pasture raised egg bites for protein on the go.

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:55.081
Ice start some leftover lard from cooking pasture raised bacon

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:56.681
by straining the particles out.

00:00:56.682 --> 00:01:00.215
And then I made some sauerkraut.
