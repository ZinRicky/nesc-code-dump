00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
Today

00:00:00.521 --> 00:00:04.321
my husband asked for beef tacos and I didn't want to let him down,

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:07.321
so I slaughtered our cow and picked the corn myself.

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:10.441
As a tried wife, my family's health is my utmost priority.

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:12.441
This means that after the cow has been slaughtered,

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:13.681
we are sure to save its offline

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:16.801
as the organs are actually the most nutrient dense part of the animal.

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:19.001
While my husband won't be looking forward to this dinner,

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.241
I am making our family kidney stew this evening

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:22.881
using one kidney from Harry

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:25.121
as we need our daily dose of B vitamins, iron,

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:26.761
copper,  Colleen  and vitamin a.

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:28.361
I grew up with stories from my mom

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.361
telling me and my siblings

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.861
that she was obsessed with her aunt's kidney stew,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.120
so I figured it would be just as easy to replicate

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:35.921
even though I didn't have her family recipe.

00:00:35.922 --> 00:00:37.681
So after a two day soak in raw milk,

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:39.761
I cooked the kidney pieces with lots of onion,

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:40.641
garlic, spices,

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:41.481
veggies, broth,

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:44.201
flour to thicken, and many hours of simmering on the stove top.

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:46.881
I prepared some wild rice that have been soaked in advance.

00:00:46.882 --> 00:00:47.721
It was time for dinner.

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:51.281
I plated each dish with a bed of rice stew and garnished with parsley

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:53.721
as my children sat around me for the moment of truth.

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:55.841
I was so proud by what I had created.

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:57.741
Is it not what you expected?

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.900
Definitely not what I expected.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.220
It's not yummy. It's yummy,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.260
but not what I expected.
