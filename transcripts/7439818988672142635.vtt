We are back from Ireland after a very long travel day.

00:05.280 --> 00:08.480
Honestly, none of us ever got on Irish time while we were there,

00:08.720 --> 00:12.780
I feel like we're not as jet lagged coming back as I had anticipated,

00:12.880 --> 00:15.140
but it feels so good to be back to the farm.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.200
Last night we went grocery shopping,

00:17.201 --> 00:20.861
so we were ready for Charlie's birthday breakfast this morning.

00:21.360 --> 00:25.720
We always do a big birthday spread for the kids birthdays,

00:25.721 --> 00:26.121
and then

00:26.122 --> 00:29.861
Daniel and I have a speaking event tonight we had to get ready for.

00:29.880 --> 00:33.000
I had an interview that I had postponed from before the trip,

00:33.001 --> 00:34.681
so I did that this afternoon

00:34.682 --> 00:38.941
and then we were off. Our event was at the Grand America Hotel.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.600
Daniel and I always get super nervous before we public speak,

00:42.601 --> 00:44.621
and tonight was no different.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.120
But we had fun telling our story.

00:47.121 --> 00:51.361
I also shared our very first Instagram Stories

00:51.362 --> 00:53.321
that we ever posted on Ballerina Farm.

00:53.322 --> 00:55.401
It was the night we got our first four pigs,

00:55.402 --> 00:57.421
so that was fun to go down memory lane.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.480
And then we ended the night eating

00:59.481 --> 01:02.601
at one of our very favorite restaurants in Utah,

01:02.602 --> 01:06.101
which is Walters. We had their handmade pasta

01:06.200 --> 01:10.400
and ended the night with the most delicious hot chocolate drink.

01:10.401 --> 01:10.978
It was so good.
