00:00.120 --> 00:01.120
Four weeks straight,

00:01.121 --> 00:04.681
my toddlers have been asking me for chicken nuggets and fries.

00:04.682 --> 00:06.481
They usually don't request a lot,

00:06.482 --> 00:09.321
so I decided to make them exactly that today.

00:09.322 --> 00:11.401
I started by grinding up my chicken

00:11.402 --> 00:14.081
and then seasoning it with onion and garlic powder,

00:14.082 --> 00:17.401
paprika and salt. I formed them into little nugget shapes

00:17.402 --> 00:20.121
and put them on a Parchment paper lined baking tray

00:20.122 --> 00:23.161
before popping them in the freezer for about 30 minutes.

00:23.162 --> 00:23.921
In the meantime,

00:23.922 --> 00:28.041
I washed my potatoes and sliced them up into matchsticks.

00:28.042 --> 00:30.041
Repeated that with all of my potatoes

00:30.042 --> 00:32.921
before placing them into ice cold water

00:32.922 --> 00:35.361
and let that sit while I made my ketchup.

00:35.362 --> 00:37.201
I combined some tomato paste,

00:37.202 --> 00:38.801
honey, vinegar, water,

00:38.802 --> 00:43.001
salt and let that simmer until thickened before letting it cool.

00:43.002 --> 00:45.841
Dried off all of my potatoes as best as I could

00:45.842 --> 00:49.321
before seasoning them up and putting them on a baking tray

00:49.322 --> 00:53.441
roast in the oven. I left them in there for about 30 to 40 minutes

00:53.442 --> 00:54.881
and when they were almost done,

00:54.882 --> 00:57.501
I started on the batter for my chicken nuggets.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.480
I mix some cornstarch, flour,

00:59.481 --> 01:02.001
seasoning and some sparkling water

01:02.002 --> 01:04.041
my chicken nuggets and some cornstarch

01:04.042 --> 01:05.241
and then in my batter

01:05.242 --> 01:09.361
before frying them up until they were golden brown on both sides.

01:09.362 --> 01:12.881
I then placed them on a wire rack and it was time to plate.

01:12.882 --> 01:14.801
Plate it up. My chicken nuggets first,

01:14.802 --> 01:17.321
then my fries and some of that homemade ketchup

01:17.322 --> 01:20.261
and my kids were so Excited to have this
