00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.360
Did you know that your hormones and your cycle

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:02.401
are gonna affect your home school

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:03.761
more than anything else? It might sound crazy,

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:04.881
but it's true, because it affects you,

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:05.921
and you set the tone for your home.

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:07.761
As women, our cycle affects everything about us.

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:08.921
Things like our mood, energy,

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:10.081
emotions, how protective we are,

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:10.961
how we feel about ourselves.

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:12.801
And all of those things play a role in our homes.

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:13.761
Because when we're feeling our best,

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:15.481
we show up as our best. And vice versa,

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.161
we're not feeling great. It's hard to put our best foot forward.

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:18.441
I know for me, the week before my cycle,

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:20.241
I have zero patience. And when it starts,

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:22.761
I have no energy. And both of those drastically affect how I teach.

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:24.161
But the good thing is, I know this about myself,

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:25.561
so I can set my expectations accordingly.

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:26.361
When I don't have patience,

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:27.481
I don't teach hard concepts,

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:28.681
and I stick to familiar activities.

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.081
We do games and activities and things my kids already know how to do.

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:32.681
And I don't incorporate new things during this time.

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:33.641
And when I know I'm gonna be tired,

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.641
I stick to the basics. We do low stress activities,

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:36.921
a lot of lounging, a lot of reading.

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:39.421
Best thing you can do as a homeschool mom is start cycle sinking
