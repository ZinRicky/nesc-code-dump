00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.960
Clean my room with me. I am 22 weeks pregnant,

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.921
and I am just starting to get my spark back,

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:07.621
just starting to get some more energy and some more good days.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.160
Before you come at me for not keeping my room clean while I'm pregnant,

00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:14.861
let me tell you that my heart rate was 160

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.620
while I was cleaning this room.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.580
So that's on a good day. Anyway,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.560
aside from that, I've just had so many clothes go up dirty and clean

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:26.881
and, you know,

00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:30.101
that in between stage that just needed to be put away

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.160
and drawers that just got super messy that needed to be organized.

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:39.161
So it was so good to finally be able to clean up this room.

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.481
My husband and I both cannot stand the mess,

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:44.441
but this pregnancy has really thrown us for a loop,

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:46.901
so my little Darcy belly.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.280
Anyway, so happy to get this room clean

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:52.081
and put away some new clothes that I bought

00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:53.941
that are maternity friendly.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.040
And then I'm giving it a final

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.561
quick vacuum with my little handheld vacuum.

00:00:59.562 --> 00:01:02.181
I love this thing so much.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.780
And then are you ready to see the finished result?

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.782
Cozy, tidy, beautiful. I love it.
