00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.040
So C sections are super prevalent in this country,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.760
and I think, in my mind,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.620
the number one cause is,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.720
oh, we need to induce you.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.400
You're 40 weeks,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.280
or you're 39 weeks,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.280
or you're old,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.040
your baby's too big,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.160
your baby's too small.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.520
Oh, did you know that babies

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.400
are more prone to stillbirth after 39 weeks?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.400
Cause of the ARRIVE trial,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.180
which is a total fucking BS.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.520
Pitocin is a known

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.040
drug that causes fetal heart distress.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.920
I've heard several women say that when they had Pitocin.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.000
Afterwards, the doctors reported that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.460
the baby's heartbeat had slowed down. Yes,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.240
Pitocin is a uterotonic drug,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.120
so it causes contractions.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.600
It goes from zero to 60 real fast.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.200
So there's, like,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.080
no early labor.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.600
They can, like,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.480
try and pretend mimic early labor,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.040
but the contractions are strong no matter what

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.920
when you're on Pitocin.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.280
So the baby doesn't get that natural, gradual,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.360
we're doing labor now.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.022
Mmm. They don't adapt well.
