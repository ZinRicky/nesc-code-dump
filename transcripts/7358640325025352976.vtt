00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.020
Our house has been hit with the dreaded gastro again.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.760
So here's everything that I made to make my family feel better

00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:10.601
because it's hard to stomach food after you've had gastro.

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:12.841
First I started off with a chicken soup.

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:15.761
My husband says that I make the best chicken soup he's ever had

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:17.801
and he's a hard critic to please.

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:19.921
So there it is on the stove.

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:22.241
Then the kids asked for McDonald's style pancakes.

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:23.881
So I thought instead of going out,

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:27.481
I just make them at home. Little bit of oil,

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:28.841
little bit of flour, egg,

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:30.041
vanilla, sugar,

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:32.441
milk and self raising flour.

00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:34.161
And they turned out so good.

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:36.181
The kids love them. All of it.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.520
Then I made a green smoothie.

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:39.481
This green smoothie

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:42.361
is something that I drink when I'm feeling really sick

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:45.121
and depleted. It replenishes you.

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.301
It honestly makes your body feel so good.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.400
Then I made this green salad on the side to just have with our chips

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:51.882
and.
