00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
I used to share a lot about my toxic family dynamics on this app,

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:05.001
and I kind of stopped sharing

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.681
because somebody gave me really good advice.

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:08.401
Another creator that I admire

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:10.761
told me that you should always share from a place of,

00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:11.561
like, a scar,

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:14.281
not an open wound, because especially with the internet,

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:17.101
people can be nasty. People can tell you all sorts of things.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.080
After a while,

00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:21.721
hundreds of comments that are negative will get to anybody.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.601
And when you're having conflicting feelings about how you were raised

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:26.701
or your childhood or your family,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.320
you know, a lot of those are not just black and white, right?

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.801
There's a lot of nuance there.

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:33.321
There's a lot of guilt and, like,

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:34.121
confusion.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.120
And it was just not a healthy thing for me to continue sharing.

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:40.321
Since that point in time, a lot has happened in my family,

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:42.081
which is not my business to share.

00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:44.841
But something that just happened in my life with my mother

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:47.521
was a positive step that I wanted to share with y'all

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:50.401
because I never thought this would happen.

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:52.681
I told my parents. Excuse me.

00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:55.461
I told my mom about the book

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.480
Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents.

00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:01.641
It's a book that's helped me a ton,

00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:04.001
and I've talked about it on here at length,

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:07.801
and she's gonna read it because she never went through the process

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:10.161
that me and my sisters are going through now.

00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:11.921
And in some ways, it's too late.

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:14.681
It's Too late to repair or, um,

00:01:14.682 --> 00:01:17.841
change the relationships and the dynamics within our family.

00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:22.441
But it's not too late for her to start healing.

00:01:22.442 --> 00:01:24.881
And I just thought that was really surprising.

00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:26.661
And as the parentified daughter,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.620
very proud of her. As the hurt child, though,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.660
I'm holding my breath.
