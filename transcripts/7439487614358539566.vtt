When I got asked to make a magazine cover from scratch,

00:03.001 --> 00:05.201
I obviously had to say yes.

00:05.202 --> 00:06.961
So welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

00:06.962 --> 00:08.561
to my first who what wear?

00:08.562 --> 00:10.521
Cover shoot. Weeks before this,

00:10.522 --> 00:12.001
I came up with the mood board,

00:12.002 --> 00:13.921
the concept, the wardrobe,

00:13.922 --> 00:15.501
hair and makeup references,

00:15.560 --> 00:19.240
nail references. After the team put together all the mood boards,

00:19.241 --> 00:23.521
I approved them, then got on a plane to LA to shoot this cover.

00:23.522 --> 00:26.641
Knew that having a really good glam team was so important to me,

00:26.642 --> 00:28.561
so I only picked people I trusted,

00:28.562 --> 00:30.161
and obviously, whimsy Lewis,

00:30.162 --> 00:33.841
part of that team. First thing we did was film a YouTube video

00:33.842 --> 00:36.601
where I got to try all the viral Erewhon smoothies

00:36.602 --> 00:38.681
and definitely had my opinions on it

00:38.682 --> 00:42.441
before doing a quick outfit change and heading downstairs to shoot.

00:42.442 --> 00:45.121
Started off with this leopard look and the cutest cat

00:45.122 --> 00:49.601
before changing into this Gucci gown was the most stunning thing,

00:49.602 --> 00:53.081
and it definitely made me feel like a completely different person.

00:53.082 --> 00:54.641
This point, I was so hungry,

00:54.642 --> 00:57.401
so I had some lunch while Chris chopped off my hair

00:57.402 --> 01:00.481
and changed into one of the two looks that we were doing.

01:00.482 --> 01:01.981
This particular haircut,

01:02.200 --> 01:05.460
and it was time for a complete hair and makeup transformation.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.260
My inspo for this was Bridget Bardell.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.080
While we were doing this, my Scaparelli look came in,

01:11.081 --> 01:13.761
and it was a workout for every single one involved,

01:13.762 --> 01:16.041
but so worth it to get the shot.

01:16.042 --> 01:17.441
After getting The cover. Whimsy

01:17.442 --> 01:19.701
and I went outside to watch the sunset

01:19.720 --> 01:22.240
before changing into the last look of the day.

01:22.241 --> 01:24.321
This whole experience was so much fun,

01:24.322 --> 01:26.401
and I can't wait for you to see the cover

01:26.402 --> 01:28.701
and read my very honest interview.
