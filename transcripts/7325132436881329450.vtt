00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.520
I have a love hate relationship with my open shelving.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.360
I feel like sometimes I'm like,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.480
this is the best thing ever.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.760
And then when I'm messy and things get cluttered,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.080
it gets overwhelming.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.420
So our word for 2024 is simplify.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.600
Jake and I really wanna simplify our lives.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.920
And for me, today,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.760
that looks like decluttering my open shelving

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.320
and trying to get everything in its proper place.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.840
We've already done this to the kitchen,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.320
and it feels so good to just simplify our lives.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.840
Less really is more.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.880
My plan is to do this to the entire house.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.040
And I'm not even gonna lie,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.120
it's a pretty good start.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.293
This made me feel so good and accomplished.
