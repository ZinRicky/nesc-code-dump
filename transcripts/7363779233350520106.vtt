00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.440
eat breakfast with me at church

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:02.401
I'm Coptic Orthodox

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:03.921
so this Sunday was Palm Sunday

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:05.081
Next Sunday is Easter

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:07.601
Orthodox calendar is different than American Christian

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:09.801
and right now I'm showing you guys macarona bechamel

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:11.761
this is basically an Egyptian lasagna

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:15.361
it's penne pasta with a meat sauce and then a bechamel sauce on top

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:17.601
but since in our religion you're supposed to fast until Easter

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:19.441
meaning basically you're vegan till Easter

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:20.361
this is I believe

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:21.461
meat and dairy free

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.680
Egyptians love to eat with a spoon for some reason

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:27.541
so here's me struggling to eat this with a spoon

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.800
this is by far my favorite Egyptian food

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.241
next I'm washing it down with Egyptian apple soda delicious

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:35.161
honestly the sodas in Egypt are so much better than the sodas in America

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:35.876
10 out of 10 

00:00:35.877 --> 00:00:37.801
next I'm gonna show you guys mahshi

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:40.081
this is basically stuffed grape leaves

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:42.161
typically it's stuffed with rice and um

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:43.321
ground beef but because again

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:43.841
we're fasting

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:44.781
it's just rice

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.040
and these are honestly very good for being vegetarian

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:48.721
I guess vegan

00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:49.361
but to this day

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:51.721
the best mahshi I ever had is my aunts

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:54.321
she painstakingly rolls them all by hand by herself

00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:56.321
makes literally hundred passes out to family like

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.281
she is phenomenal

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:59.281
I'm wrapping up the leftovers to give to my family

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:00.681
this mass went on so long (longer than usual, past 1pm!)

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:02.721
it was 12:30 we've been there since 9:30

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:03.254
I was tired 

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:03.921
this is dessert

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:05.281
it's basically Egyptian kÃ¼nefe 

00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:06.081
I think there's another name

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:06.761
but I can't remember

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:10.221
and it's like shredded filo dough with cheese and then simple syrup

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.360
honestly phenomenal

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:12.681
to this day besides family

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:14.761
the Egyptian church is the only place that I've had

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:16.001
Egyptian food that's actually good

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:20.161
otherwise in a restaurant just never hit the same as church or family

00:01:20.162 --> 00:01:21.641
I don't like filming myself in public

00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:22.161
so I was like

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:23.361
looking around the entire time

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:24.441
but yeah it was all delicious

00:01:24.442 --> 00:01:27.301
and thank you for sticking around and watching me have breakfast in church

00:01:27.302 --> 00:01:28.241
Happy Palm Sunday

00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:29.232
I love you guys so much okay
