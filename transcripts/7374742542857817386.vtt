I know this is a totally innocent comment

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.740
and there's literally nothing against commenter

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.840
however I don't like it when we talk about issues with like

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.520
romantic love and the automatic response is oh

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:10.160
you have to love yourself

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:12.840
like self love is not going to replace romantic love

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.480
it's not gonna replace the desire for that and

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:16.560
you know the feelings that come with it

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.680
so um

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:18.200
I would just like

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:19.240
I don't know I I

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:22.520
I think a lot of people are struggling with dating and romance

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:23.280
and having a crush

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.160
like I think it's a very normal thing to do

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.560
and I don't think that you have to just like

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:28.480
learn to love yourself because I

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:29.240
I do love myself

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:33.086
that doesn't help with me being insane when I have a crush
