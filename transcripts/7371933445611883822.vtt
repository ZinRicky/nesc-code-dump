00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
I’m so happy that people are finally waking up to the idea that staying at home

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:08.000
having traditional values, cooking, cleaning

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.550
being feminine, wearing dresses 

00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:13.340
brings you in your feminine energy

00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:14.680
Because for so long

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.080
we've been taught by feminists

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:19.720
that we're not allowed to want to have a simple life

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:22.040
to want to take care of our family or home

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:23.960
We’ve been told to try and girl boss

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.160
be a boss

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:28.361
When there’s nothing wrong with wanting a simple life 

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.200
and enjoying your feminine side.

00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:34.380
So I'm glad that people are finally opening their eyes 

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:36.660
to the true, pure joys of life.
