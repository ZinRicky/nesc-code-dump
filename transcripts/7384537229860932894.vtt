00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.960
That's so cool. Look,

00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:02.201
an abortion clinic. Yeah,

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:02.681
no, that's a.

00:00:02.682 --> 00:00:03.881
That's a fake abortion clinic.

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:04.801
What are you talking about?

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:06.641
It says free pregnancy test.

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:08.221
It says women's clinic.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.520
They'll lure pregnant women with free pregnancy tests

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.081
and free ultrasounds, but they're really just there to,

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:14.841
like, talk you out of getting an abortion.

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:15.441
There's, like,

00:00:15.442 --> 00:00:16.761
doctors in there, right?

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:19.161
They'll walk around with lab coats and pretend like they're doctors,

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.161
but they're not. Okay,

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:22.321
well, I guess if they're just giving out information,

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.681
they can't really hurt anybody.

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:25.441
The information they were giving out was actually correct.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.121
But one study found that 87% of them lied to women,

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:29.761
telling them that abortion causes, like,

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.641
breast cancer. Damn.

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:32.521
Wow. Okay,

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:33.481
so a lot of them must be, like,

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:35.241
shutting down. Actually,

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:37.421
more and more of them are opening.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.700
Okay, so the government must be trying to cut the funding.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.220
No, the government actually funds them.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.160
What, 2022 alone,

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:47.521
they got, like,

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:49.741
$1.4 billion in taxpayer funded money.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.280
But there's not, like,

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:54.621
more fake clinics than real abortion clinics, though, right?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.520
Yeah. For every real clinic,

00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:59.761
there's three fake ones. Wow.

00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:02.401
Okay, so they have a lot of information about pregnant women.

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:04.781
They're keeping all of that private thing.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.560
Even though it's a fake clinic,

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:08.901
they still have to respect HIPAA.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.040
There's not even, like,

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.021
a data breach or something?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.391
I gotta go.
