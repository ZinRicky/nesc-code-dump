00:00.040 --> 00:02.860
Let's do a homemade kitchen restock.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.560
So I got started, actually,

00:04.561 --> 00:07.321
really early in the morning on two loaves of sourdough bread

00:07.322 --> 00:09.381
because my starter was ready and active.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.680
Um, so I baked that later on.

00:11.681 --> 00:16.941
And then I started by making my daughter these homemade popsicles.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.000
These are super nourishing.

00:19.001 --> 00:21.261
They have collagen, all the good stuff,

00:21.280 --> 00:23.000
raw milk. Um,

00:23.001 --> 00:24.921
and I just popped those in the freezer,

00:24.922 --> 00:26.721
and they turn out really good.

00:26.722 --> 00:29.481
Then I made us some gut healing,

00:29.482 --> 00:31.481
like, gelatin gummies.

00:31.482 --> 00:33.801
These are our favorite. I made mango flavor this time,

00:33.802 --> 00:37.961
and they turned out so, so good that we went through them in, like,

00:37.962 --> 00:39.981
two days because they were that good.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.520
Um, so these are super,

00:41.521 --> 00:45.161
super nourishing. And then I got started on, like,

00:45.162 --> 00:47.441
these, like, sourdough, uh,

00:47.442 --> 00:49.081
cheese crackers for my daughter.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.601
I was gonna let these ferment,

00:50.602 --> 00:53.161
but honestly, I just, like,

00:53.162 --> 00:53.681
you know, I was like,

00:53.682 --> 00:55.441
you know what? I'm just gonna bake them right away.

00:55.442 --> 00:56.961
And I did. I typically don't do that,

00:56.962 --> 00:58.721
but still, they turned out really good.

00:58.722 --> 01:00.961
I'll just probably ferment them next time.

01:00.962 --> 01:03.961
And then I made blueberry muffins for my daughter for, like,

01:03.962 --> 01:05.961
early mornings for her to have, like,

01:05.962 --> 01:07.321
a little, um, snack.

01:07.322 --> 01:08.981
These have a lot of protein,

01:09.080 --> 01:10.520
so I pop those in the oven,

01:10.521 --> 01:12.901
and she absolutely love these.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.120
And then the last thing is my, like,

01:15.121 --> 01:16.441
homemade honey lemonade,

01:16.442 --> 01:20.341
which I add a little splash of this to my herbal iced Tea every day.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.000
Um, and just to have in the fridge.

01:23.001 --> 01:24.161
We love this in the summer.

01:24.162 --> 01:26.937
So I made that and that was all.
