There's a few things I can't live without,

00:01.841 --> 00:05.601
and the people that have stuck around know how much I adore hourglass.

00:05.602 --> 00:08.641
Lately, I've been using the Veil Hydrating Skin Tint.

00:08.642 --> 00:11.601
Super lightweight and immediately melts into my skin.

00:11.602 --> 00:15.041
Now these Vanish Airbrush Concealers are my holy grail.

00:15.042 --> 00:17.001
Don't ever go a day without them.

00:17.002 --> 00:21.121
Mix Sienna and flax, let them dry a little bit before blending them out.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.641
It's a full coverage concealer that still feels very lightweight.

00:24.642 --> 00:27.308
Then I finish it off with the Phantom Glossy Balm.
