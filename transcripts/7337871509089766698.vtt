00:00.240 --> 00:02.680
This is the kind of thing that makes people lose trust

00:02.680 --> 00:04.120
in the medical community

00:04.120 --> 00:05.760
and in the journalism community.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.440
As a female who has breastfed two babies,

00:08.440 --> 00:10.000
I can tell you that there is a

00:10.000 --> 00:12.920
massive list of DOS and don'ts for breastfeeding.

00:12.920 --> 00:13.960
Every single doctor,

00:13.960 --> 00:14.760
every single nurse,

00:14.760 --> 00:17.340
every single medical expert I have ever heard from

00:17.440 --> 00:19.120
emphasize how important it is

00:19.120 --> 00:20.480
to watch what you are eating,

00:20.480 --> 00:22.080
watch what medicine you are taking,

00:22.080 --> 00:23.720
even the creams you're putting on your face.

00:23.720 --> 00:24.920
Because all of those things

00:24.920 --> 00:26.000
can get into the breast milk,

00:26.000 --> 00:27.440
even if it's just little traces.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.560
You want the breast milk to be as pure

00:29.560 --> 00:31.160
as possible for your baby.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.640
That is why we breastfeed,

00:32.640 --> 00:34.140
is to give them what they need.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.680
Mothers everywhere know this.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.000
They're very, very,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.560
very careful about what they put into their bodies

00:39.560 --> 00:40.960
when they are breastfeeding a baby.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.240
And the reason that we are so careful

00:42.240 --> 00:44.000
is because we prioritize the health

00:44.000 --> 00:45.640
and the well being of our babies

00:45.640 --> 00:47.560
above our own wants and desires

00:47.560 --> 00:50.860
for different substances and medicine and food.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.720
This is the exact opposite of that.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.080
This is narcissism on a level I have never seen before.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.560
Children are not props.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.760
Children are not lifestyle accessories.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.400
Children are

01:00.400 --> 01:02.480
the most important people in this entire world,

01:02.480 --> 01:03.897
and they deserve better than this.
