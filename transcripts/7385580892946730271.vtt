00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
Joe Biden can beat Donald Trump if he steps down.

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:07.281
As a lover of democracy and my female bodily autonomy,

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:08.621
nothing makes me more

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.400
then admitting that this is the beginning of the end for Joe Biden.

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.401
But Joe Biden has the opportunity

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:17.001
to turn his worst moment in his presidency

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:21.101
into his best one. By doing what Lyndon Johnson did in 1968

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.440
and step aside

00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:27.121
and let credit candidates bat it out at the democratic convention,

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:30.201
Biden could effectively fulfill his promise

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:32.101
of being a transitional figure

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.320
and create space for the next person to come in

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:36.841
and put his country first.

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:39.781
And prevent the democracy ending.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.240
Uh, possibility of Trump getting a second term.

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:46.281
And while there's not a lot of viable candidates,

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:48.121
there's not a lot of time before the election.

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:49.361
Like, I recognize,

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:50.981
all of those things are valid.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.480
Joe Biden stepping down right now

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:56.341
would actually also solve a lot of problems.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.120
It means that Democrats could finally go after Trump

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:02.381
for his biggest weakness apart from his 91 convictions,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.960
his age, and his unfitness for office.

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:08.841
Right now, they literally can't do that because, yeah,

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:10.481
Trump is old, but Biden is older.

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:12.041
To have a second Trump presidency

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:14.301
could just have irreversible consequences.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.060
Joe Biden has an opportunity to make his Mark in history.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.200
And opening up the field is risky,

00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:23.141
but so is staying in the game.
