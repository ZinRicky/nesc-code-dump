00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.960
Give me a second while I nurse my baby

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.661
so that I can respond to this very ignorant comment.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.080
So this must be the most ignorant comment I've ever gotten,

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.841
and I've gotten a lot of those.

00:00:10.842 --> 00:00:11.921
I really hope, ma'am,

00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:14.321
that you don't have a daughter you're giving advice to

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:16.881
and you give stay at home moms a bad name.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:22.081
The literal definition of a stay at home mom is a mom who stays home.

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:24.301
There are women who run their own businesses,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.700
who work remotely,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.740
and who have side hustles that are still stay at home moms.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.480
Second, you don't know my financial situation,

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:35.721
so don't ever make a bold Assumption like that.

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:38.401
With my first son, when I quit my corporate job,

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:42.801
I 100% stopped doing everything and just stayed home,

00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:44.061
including my side hustles.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.160
But I also built my social media like six years ago

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.501
because I knew the impact of digital marketing

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.300
and its projected growth

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.000
and how it could help so many women just like me

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:55.241
monetize social media

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:58.701
so that they could stay home with their children if they need to.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.160
Some make full incomes from it,

00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:03.281
I do not. Some make a little extra money here and there.

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:06.141
Most of my stuff at this point is passive

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600
from what I built before I had kids.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.721
And occasionally I repurpose a video.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.140
99% of the things that I recommend to women who wanna work from home

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.200
and I direct them towards I Absolutely

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:21.721
make zero money off of actually lose time from talking to them

00:01:21.722 --> 00:01:23.761
and trying to figure out what fits their personality best,

00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:27.201
because I've done it all. But I do it because it's a passion of mine.

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:30.601
And I post videos like this when my children are asleep.

00:01:30.602 --> 00:01:32.801
It's crazy that I'm not a stay at home mom.

00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:34.521
Um, even though I,

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:37.201
like, co slept and nursed my baby all night,

00:01:37.202 --> 00:01:39.521
I woke up at the butt crack of dawn with both of them.

00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:42.521
I work 24 hours and weekends and holidays,

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:45.261
and I literally don't leave my home.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.320
It's crazy. The whole reason I started digital marketing

00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:51.801
and monetizing social media,

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:53.821
especially when I work in the financial industry,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.640
was because I knew one day I wanted to stay home.

00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:59.601
So when I was in college, I literally said,

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:01.921
what is an industry that I know is flexible,

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:03.161
that I know I can be my own boss,

00:02:03.162 --> 00:02:06.961
and that I know I can make either a full time salary or even part time,

00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:09.741
or maybe just a side hustle and extra hundred bucks a week.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.880
I put a lot of thought into that way early on,

00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:16.061
into my early 20s, because I knew what I wanted.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
And back then, before I had kids,

00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:21.561
I was absolutely hundred percent monetizing social media.

00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:24.441
But regarding your other comment about how I get paid from TikTok,

00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:26.881
absolutely have never received a dime from these videos

00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:28.001
from any platform.

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:31.941
All I've done Is create a community of like minded people.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.480
And the hair products that I represent,

00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:36.221
it's definitely just affiliate marketing,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.100
definitely not a pyramid scheme.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.560
You literally know nothing.

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:43.121
I have reoccurring customers who just buy the product.

00:02:43.122 --> 00:02:45.661
I have no one that works the business for me or under me.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.440
And if they do want to, they approach me about it.

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:50.081
I don't advertise or market it.

00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:51.121
And from that,

00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:54.981
I'll make right now looks like an extra hundred dollars a week.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.900
Sometimes like 60 bucks a week.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.840
But when you're cloth diapering and you're eating alcohol year,

00:02:59.841 --> 00:03:02.081
and you are clipping coupons,

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:03.641
and you're living within your means,

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:06.621
an extra 60, 50 bucks a week goes a long way.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.480
So just because I bring in a little extra side money,

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.521
does not mean I am not a real stay at home mom.

00:03:13.522 --> 00:03:16.341
So you stop. And pertaining to your man.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.640
God, I feel bad for him.

00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:20.921
My man absolutely provides for all of our needs.

00:03:20.922 --> 00:03:22.081
I am fed, clothed,

00:03:22.082 --> 00:03:23.201
and I have a roof over my head.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.541
And both my babies are taken care of.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.400
Sorry, I had like a 6,

00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.481
7 hour intermission. Apparently we're all getting sick.

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:32.881
And I take care of babies and clean.

00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:36.061
Before the men came back from hunting anyway.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.240
Ma'am,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.280
just because a woman has a side hustle,

00:03:40.281 --> 00:03:43.241
or brings in extra bucks here and there,

00:03:43.242 --> 00:03:44.441
or even if she worked for Molly,

00:03:44.442 --> 00:03:47.361
it does not make her any less of a Stay at home, mom.

00:03:47.362 --> 00:03:49.361
So, like,

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:53.401
honest to god, now that I'm seven hours later finishing this video,

00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:56.461
I'm like, why do I even give you the time of day?

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.060
It's this. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.840
Um. Oh, yeah.

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:03.881
And as far as my Instagram, again,

00:04:03.882 --> 00:04:09.541
started that years ago, and I honestly don't even post on it anymore.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.760
I mainly just through my stories.

00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:13.201
So you would know that, though,

00:04:13.202 --> 00:04:13.961
if you actually, like,

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.001
followed me and knew me. But you're not.

00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:18.061
You're just a troll.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.711
Have a good day.
