00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
We're gonna make jam today. Jam?

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.900
And we're cutting strawberries right now.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.340
But you can stir it.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.380
Stir it? Stir what? The sugar.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.620
Eat the strawberry still.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.100
Oh, that looks like mustard.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.020
What are you doing?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.580
Mixing it.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.500
Haha.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.500
You made your change?

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.260
Was your shower discovered?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.780
Was your coffee right?

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.860
So we're still taking pills in the morning?

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.780
Did you lose pet long enough?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.540
Throw up in the ocean town

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.940
purpose? At a dark in the sunlight

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.200
nothing but the water. That sunrise now.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.581
Just to let you know that now.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.300
Cause this town's up in ocean now.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.120
Hey, I miss this place.

00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:51.441
Face your head and your heart.

00:01:51.442 --> 00:01:57.401
And my head still tells me when this pain in your songs would happen.

00:01:57.402 --> 00:02:00.521
At the way that you would say.

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:05.121
If only baby there were cameras in the traffic lights.

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:07.181
It'd make me a star

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.740
start.
