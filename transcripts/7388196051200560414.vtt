00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
You're already paying thousands of dollars for an attorney

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:03.761
for custody court.

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:07.441
A little hundred and something extra isn't what's breaking the bank.

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:09.041
The situation is what sucks.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.641
The fact that you need this is what sucks.

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:14.281
But buying this is not what's breaking the bank,

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.601
and it's not, you know,

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:16.401
hurting anything. This,

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:16.801
if anything,

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:21.201
is gonna help you maximize the larger investment of the attorney,

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:23.841
of the college classes, of the courses that you're taking.

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:25.641
And actually, right now it's $30 off.

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:29.201
It's normally 1 85 and it's like 1 55 right now on the TikTok shop.

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:31.801
It's linked right here. It is truly worth it, like,

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:35.301
cause the way it lays out all the information for you is like,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.720
it's just so much work done for you

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:40.801
and so much of the remembering,

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:41.361
you know what I mean? Like,

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:44.461
if I'm paying my attorney $500 an hour,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.440
when I talk to him on the phone,

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:52.361
I want every last detail of what he said so that I'm not forgetting it.

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:55.921
Cause what's the point of paying for all this money if it's like, ah,

00:00:55.922 --> 00:01:01.081
I'm too, I'm too chaotic to kind of do my part in the process?

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:01.961
So this is.

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:05.521
It's like you constantly have an assistant that's helping you,

00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:07.521
someone walking into every meeting with you.

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:11.961
You know, you have your little AI virtual assistant on your phone

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:13.281
walking into every meeting,

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.221
attending every phone call with you.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.280
And so, you know,

00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.861
it just helps You maximize the bigger investment,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.880
so. But okay.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.501
