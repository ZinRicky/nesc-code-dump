00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
I'm not usually a person who has trouble expressing herself with words.

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:08.561
I usually know exactly what I wanna say and how I wanna say it

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:10.781
around a lot of different topics.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.840
In the next few days,

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:13.041
if you are a follower of mine,

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:14.701
you are going to start to see

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.520
me promoting the gofundme of a family from Gaza.

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:23.621
I have partnered with Operation Olive Branch and passed the hat

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.560
and have been given a family to help

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:29.081
escape the violence that they are experiencing in Gaza.

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:34.861
As I do that, I'm going to also be trying to educate about how you can

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.780
support the people in Gaza

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.040
without succumbing to anti Semitism

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:42.721
and without spreading hate speech in your comments.

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:45.881
I have found, especially for progressive Jews,

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:48.481
that we are very, um,

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:52.881
supportive of the civilians right to self determination to civilians,

00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:54.281
right to dignity,

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:57.501
to humans, right to life.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.140
But we also have noticed that a lot of y'all have not yet unpacked

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.840
your antisemitism

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:08.821
or the antisemitism that exists within our culture

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.900
in order to be fully effective without doing Undo Harm.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.900
Now I'm going to do this purely for educational purposes

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.600
because I think it's important.

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:20.761
There are a lot of people talking about how to combat

00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:21.921
anti Semitism on this app,

00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:25.641
but a lot of them are doing it from a pro Israel standpoint

00:01:25.642 --> 00:01:26.641
in my opinion.

00:01:26.642 --> 00:01:27.001
Unfortunately,

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:29.181
I think that just causes more

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.440
black and white team type mentalities with both of these issues.

00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:39.441
Because you can believe in the dignity of all humans.

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:41.241
And there's a lot of people on both sides

00:01:41.242 --> 00:01:43.721
that are ignoring the humanity of each other.

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:45.421
I wanna help people.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.580
I want to help civilians.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.440
And as a Jewish American,

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.541
of course, that includes the hostages,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.360
but it also includes the gossems,

00:01:54.361 --> 00:02:00.381
who are undeniably being killed at a much higher rate at the moment.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.180
You focus on who needs the most immediate help immediately,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.760
and that's what I'm doing.

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:09.161
If you wanna find out more about Operation Olive Branch

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:10.681
or pass the hat,

00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:12.481
you can go to Aaron's page.

00:02:12.482 --> 00:02:14.061
I'm gonna tag her down below.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.480
And I hope that you will consider donating

00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:18.121
to the family that I've been assigned.

00:02:18.122 --> 00:02:21.301
And if you simply wanna have conversations about

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.240
activism without doing undue harm, um,

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:28.941
I hope you stick around, because I would like to navigate this together.
