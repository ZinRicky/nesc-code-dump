00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.440
Let's be real.

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:06.321
You're gonna want to do something cute and special for Christmas.

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:08.921
Like, we all wanna do this basket

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:10.861
if you're already gonna buy it for laundry.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.880
This is my plan for Christmas.

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:18.441
Like, I'm going to just fill it with all, like,

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:21.041
little Christmas gifts. The ones that aren't the big fucking deal,

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:22.001
the ones that aren't like,

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.241
holy shit, but, like,

00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:24.841
their gifts. Just to make it, like,

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:25.281
all, like,

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:27.201
cute and organized. Or, like,

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:29.281
she's saying, this could be the, like,

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:30.481
advent calendar, you know,

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:33.021
you pull out a book or you pull out a box.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.640
This little basket, I just fucking love it.

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:38.701
It's just so cute and pretty.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.800
To put other shit in and make it look like,

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:42.681
Ho, ho, ho,

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:44.021
like, what a Merry Christmas.
