00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.360
I've made this warm Chimichurri

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:02.780
chicken and orzo salad 

00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:05.200
probably twice a week for the last month or so

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.800
and in my opinion it's getting pretty close to perfection

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:09.560
and it's not just quick easy and delicious

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:11.529
but it's adaptable to whatever season you're in 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.760
or whatever protein you'd like

00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:15.480
and somehow the leftovers taste even better the next day

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:16.880
start by finding dicing garlic

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:19.280
half a shallot alongside coriander and parsley

00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:22.280
pop all that in a large mixing bowl and then add dried oregano

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:23.760
red wine vinegar olive oil

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.280
lemon juice and salt and pepper

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:26.160
give it a stir then

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.400
I like to reserve about half a cup at this point

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:30.480
and like anything the longer you marinate it for

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:31.280
the better it tastes

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.941
so you can make the chimichurri sauce 

00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:34.560
or marinate the chicken ahead of time

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:36.800
but today I'm in a rush so I've added seared chicken

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:38.520
transferred that to a cast iron dish

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.480
and pop that in the oven at about 200Â°C for about half an hour

00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:43.280
for my salad I've got orzo, chickpeas

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:44.480
rocket tomato cucumber

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:46.360
capsicum avocado and bocconcini

00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:49.000
pour over the reserved dressing and then give it a good mix

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.920
and then to plate I put a generous portion of that salad down

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:53.920
top it with my sliced chimichurri chicken

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:56.360
and I finish it all off with some extra sauce from the pan

00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:57.280
and I'm telling you right now

00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.680
this meal will not disappoint

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:00.440
each bite is a flavour experience

00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:01.760
it's herby, it's tangy

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.470
it's hearty and dare I say it 

00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:04.315
fkn good for you
