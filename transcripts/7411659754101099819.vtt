00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.280
You ever catch yourself complaining about your boring life?

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:07.640
because it's normal and stable and there's no chaos in it?

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:09.980
Then you think back about the crazy life

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.720
the unsure the uncertainty of your past

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:18.400
and you remember you wished that you were exactly where you were at now 

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:20.720
when you were going through all of that chaos

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.320
you prayed and you dreamed of the life that you have now

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:26.160
really puts everything in perspective

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.880
because I would rather take my boring

00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:32.040
normal life over the chaotic past 

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:33.880
that life isn't serving me

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:35.960
the life I'm living now is serving me

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:39.080
if you're ever feeling dull or bored

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:40.600
you're tired of your routine

00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:42.640
think back about that chaos

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.542
really ask yourself is that really what I'm missing
