00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.700
Okay, I want you to follow me on this thought process.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.640
The children would not be around an abusive person

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:09.781
if you weren't in an abusive relationship.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.060
So you're actually not keeping them safe when you're there.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.180
You are the person that brought them into an abusive situation

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.680
and is keeping them in that abusive situation.

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:26.441
Because you've tricked yourself to think you're helping

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:29.281
and you're doing good, when the most important thing you could do

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:32.261
is get your children to safety

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.520
at least some of the time.

00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:39.201
They deserve a break from the bullshit at least some of the time.

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:45.281
But to grow up under someone's fucking hard thumb and rules

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:51.561
and anxiety and tension and eggshells is.

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:53.561
You're not doing what you think you're doing.

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:56.501
You know what I mean? You're the one keeping them in that situation,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.360
never giving them a break from it.

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:00.361
And they could grow up and be like,

00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:01.301
well, mom,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.860
if you loved us so much and if you were so concerned,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.640
why didn't you get us out?

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:08.481
Why didn't you give us a break, ever?

00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:10.721
Do you know what I mean? I'm not trying to come at you hard.

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:12.261
I'm not trying to come at you rude,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.240
I. You know what I mean?

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:14.521
But you gotta think of it differently.

00:01:14.522 --> 00:01:16.381
You're not keeping them safe.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.920
That is their dad. That's the person that is their father.

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:21.401
You can't fucking control that.

00:01:21.402 --> 00:01:22.201
You had a chance.

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:24.161
That's the man that you picked to Be the father of their kids.

00:01:24.162 --> 00:01:27.581
Believe me, there's lots of us that have to repent for that.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.820
But staying in the situation,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.420
you're not doing them any favors.
