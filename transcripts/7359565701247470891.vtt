00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.560
Come with me as I go to WITS,

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.981
the women in Travel Summit hosted in Utah,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.400
it was a jam packed weekend of women learning from each other, sharing,

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:08.121
collaborating,

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:11.521
networking, and exploring the great outdoors in Utah

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:13.361
in both Park City and Salt Lake.

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:16.641
Not only did I get some really valuable information about how to grow

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:18.781
the travel side of my content,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.320
but I got to experience some of the coolest things

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.881
about this part of the country

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:23.801
the natural beauty,

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:24.401
the adventure,

00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:25.601
the shopping, the food,

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:26.601
the culture, the history,

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:28.921
the art. I will definitely be coming back to Utah,

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:31.768
and I cannot wait for next year's Width Summit in New York.
