00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.200
okay no offense to this creator

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.020
cause there's tons like her

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.440
but as somebody who's lived in Charleston for 13 years

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:10.640
not a born and raised local

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:13.080
but somebody who moved here before it had like

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:16.480
blown up on the map people moving here to pursue a like

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:20.960
Charleston influencer aesthetic are kind of ruining Charleston

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:23.960
don't mean to say that everybody who moves here is doing that

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:26.520
because a lot of people move here for a lot of different reasons

00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:28.080
and it's blown up since Covid

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:28.840
but I will tell you

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:32.560
that the people who come here with a preconceived idea of what Charleston is

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:35.000
without also assimilating to like

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:39.120
some of the cultural nuances here make it less fun to be here

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:40.160
I moved here from New York

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:43.320
I was one of the only people that had moved here

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:46.000
all of my core friends were born and raised Charlestonians

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.000
and as someone new to the area

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:49.600
you had to learn how to assimilate

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:51.040
you assimilated into the culture

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:54.000
you talked to the grocery store checkout lady at the Piggly Wiggly

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:55.080
walk a little slower

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:58.200
you get used to the fact that we didn't have Doordash and Uber Eats

00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:00.160
and all of these things that you're used to in a big city

00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:03.120
there's a slowness and a charm about this city

00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.080
that was so magical and so enchanting

00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:06.760
I swear to god

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:09.760
as soon as travel and leisure got a hold of it and started posting it as like

00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:12.220
the best small city in the United States

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.320
so many people moved here without taking the breath to become part of Charleston

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:20.840
they wanna video it they wanna get their outfit of the day

00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:22.800
they wanna go to every hot restaurant

00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:27.200
but they haven't really made friends with people who are locals here

00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:28.600
you see it with businesses too

00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.880
there's so many investor LED businesses that are moving to Charleston

00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:34.420
that is pushing out the mom and pop shops

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.280
the chef owned restaurants

00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:38.200
driving up rentals for storefronts

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.000
driving up housing costs

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.240
creating a massive problem with traffic and infrastructure

00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:46.680
because we have built for just all of the new people

00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:50.040
coming into these high density living situations

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:51.880
out any new roads or highways

00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:55.400
Carlton just doesn't feel the same as it did 13 years ago

00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:58.140
and my husband's been here like 25 years

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.000
and it just doesn't feel the same

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.480
this shouldn't be LA and don't get me wrong

00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:07.760
there's a lot of positives to money and tourism coming into the city

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.440
absolutely because you used to not be able to have a freaking job here

00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:14.880
unless you worked F&B but as someone who is also a newcomer to Charleston

00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:17.400
but has lived here long enough to see the changes

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:19.600
and somebody who moved here and became like

00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:22.480
extremely protective over the way of life here

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:24.680
and over the way people treat each other here

00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:27.160
and just over the the sleepy

00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:30.320
quiet town vibe that Charleston used to have

00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:34.440
just kinda makes me sad Charleston does not cater to the locals anymore

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:38.060
in price in what they're selling and how they're selling it

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.380
and it's really unsustainable for the people who've made their life here
