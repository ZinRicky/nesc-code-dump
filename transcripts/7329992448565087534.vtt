00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.360
So this was a comment on one of my reels

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.400
about being a stay at home wife and mother

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.480
and like, you know,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.880
being the keeper of a home and being just at home. And I.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.600
I want to address this one

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.400
because I feel like it's a really common misconception

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.320
that a lot of people have

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.760
that if you are like

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.700
that trad wife or mom

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.660
that you basically

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.600
all you're allowed to do is stay home.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.740
Literally. Like,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.960
you really don't do anything with your life.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.680
You just. You're at home all the time

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.720
and you're with your kids

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.280
and you're doing housework 24 7. And, um,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.900
that's really not true.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.640
Um, I. I'm a stay at home mom.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.720
I have four kids.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.580
I don't have like,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.020
a career or job outside of the home,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.880
but I do. I, um,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.940
design dresses and sell them.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.020
And having that creative outlet is really huge

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.180
and helping me to not become overwhelmed with, um.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.460
With that mundaneness that you can experience

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.100
of doing the same thing every day.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.680
And so, yeah, it.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.800
I totally understand what this lady saying

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.720
that it can be depressing

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.000
if all you do is you just stay home

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.980
because you think that's what you have to do to be.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.940
I tried wife or whatever.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.820
Um, but yeah, I mean,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.720
I guess where the line is for me is

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.180
if I am doing anything that

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.740
puts my husband or my kids on the back burner

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.800
and They're not first in my life.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.520
Then that's where I draw the line

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.400
and be like, okay,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.940
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.660
And I feel like if I did try to do a career,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.100
um, my husband and my kids,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.600
it would be very hard

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.000
to give them first priority in my life.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.280
So anyways, I just, um,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.880
wanted to put that out there

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.000
that being a stay at home mom is not.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.200
Does not mean you're cooped up all the time.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.120
You definitely should have some kind of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.460
creative outlets.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.760
You should go places and do things.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.200
You should get a babysitter every now and again

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.420
and go have fun.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.480
I mean, yeah,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.800
it doesn't mean that you're

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.080
cooped up at home all the time.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.580
So I just wanted to clear that up.
