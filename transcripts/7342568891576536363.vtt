00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
signs you're dating an immature boy and not a good man

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:05.121
I feel like we should all know this,

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:08.881
but here's some signs that you're dating a boy and not a man

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:10.281
Ladies if you're single right now,

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:14.501
listen up! because we all know that age does not equate to maturity

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.080
guys can still be in their 30s,

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:19.681
40s, or even 50s and still act like immature boys

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:21.801
and come on you probably know a couple.

00:00:21.802 --> 00:00:23.361
 we're not getting any younger,

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:27.281
so we don't have time to waste on immature boys right?

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:31.421
here's how you can differentiate the men from the boys

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.520
How you can tell he's an immature boy,

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:35.881
number one if he goes partying

00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:38.561
and post pictures of himself partying all the time

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:41.201
maybe he's going to a concert, rave,

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:43.221
Coachella, burning man,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.000
steer clear and run far!

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.181
unless of course you're also interested in that

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.580
If he’s posting pictures with bottles and girls and other Chad looking guys,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.440
run! he's a boy,

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:56.164
not a man!

00:00:56.165 --> 00:01:00.261
 number two- if they ask for your Snapchat before asking for your number

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.640
Should come as a no brainer,

00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:04.641
because oftentimes if you add someone's number,

00:01:04.642 --> 00:01:06.081
then you can find them on Snapchat.

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:08.641
why not just be a man and ask for the number?

00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:09.961
okay that is a boy,

00:01:09.962 --> 00:01:10.916
not a man 

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:14.421
No. 3 if he has to pregame before any social event

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.360
Men who are mature do not need a pregame

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:19.481
they can wait until said event and buy their alcohol there

00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:21.481
okay we're not 18 anymore

00:01:21.482 --> 00:01:23.021
we can afford the booze

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.340
That is a boy, not a man

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.360
No. 4 if they don't ask you on a date

00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:29.521
okay if a man is really interested in you

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.061
he's gonna ask you on a date

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.400
not continuously text you

00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:33.761
just to leave you on that

00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:35.541
is a boy not a man

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.880
No. 5 if he never pays for you

00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:41.781
meaning if he's taking you out on dates and you're always splitting the tab

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.500
then he's showing you that he's not able to provide for you as a man

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.140
That’s a boy not a man

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.560
ladies please pay attention to the signs

00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:54.161
and realize if you're dating an immature boy or a man!
