00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.803
okay so the documentary people came today

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:05.983
if you were on live

00:00:05.984 --> 00:00:07.663
you were like there when they like

00:00:07.664 --> 00:00:09.563
literally knocked on the door and they let them in

00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:14.383
and they spent a few hours with me just doing like

00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:15.103
talking to me

00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:18.263
talking about stuff like that we could talk about since my kids weren't around

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:20.683
and I showed them like old pictures and stuff

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:24.903
and then they actually came with me to exchange when I went to pick up my kids

00:00:24.904 --> 00:00:27.123
and they filmed like what that's like

00:00:27.383 --> 00:00:31.063
and in France there's like laws and shit where they can't show kids faces

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:32.583
like they don't need permission

00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:35.863
because they're not ever gonna show my kids in the fucking documentary

00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:40.503
so they're filming all kinds of shit but they're not gonna really put my kids

00:00:40.504 --> 00:00:43.363
like their faces on anything

00:00:44.103 --> 00:00:45.123
