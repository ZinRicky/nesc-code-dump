00:00.040 --> 00:01.400
We were about to go to bed

00:01.401 --> 00:04.401
when I realized that we were all out of toothpaste.

00:04.402 --> 00:07.001
So my husband went downstairs to make some.

00:07.002 --> 00:09.201
Lucky is very precise in his measurements,

00:09.202 --> 00:13.081
so he started out by measuring some bentonite clay.

00:13.082 --> 00:16.801
He added that to a bowl with a tablespoon of water.

00:16.802 --> 00:18.481
We weren't making a huge batch,

00:18.482 --> 00:20.081
so this was more than enough.

00:20.082 --> 00:22.441
He mixed until it was all smooth.

00:22.442 --> 00:24.481
Broke a spoon in the process.

00:24.482 --> 00:27.521
Then he moved on to measuring out some coconut oil

00:27.522 --> 00:29.921
and adding that to our clay mixture.

00:29.922 --> 00:33.081
He also added a teaspoon of baking soda.

00:33.082 --> 00:34.881
He gave that a really good mix.

00:34.882 --> 00:36.841
Made sure everything was combined

00:36.842 --> 00:39.441
before he added the last two ingredients,

00:39.442 --> 00:43.321
which were some stevia and peppermint essential oil.

00:43.322 --> 00:44.721
We love our toothpaste.

00:44.722 --> 00:47.561
Quite minty. So he added a lot of essential oil

00:47.562 --> 00:49.881
before mixing that up one last time

00:49.882 --> 00:52.941
and transferring that over to a glass container.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.760
Everyone's teeth are different,

00:54.761 --> 00:56.441
so this might not work for everyone,

00:56.442 --> 00:59.081
but the smell of this and the texture of this,

00:59.082 --> 01:00.941
I love having it on hand.
