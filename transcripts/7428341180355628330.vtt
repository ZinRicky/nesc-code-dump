Do you ever crave something

00:01.081 --> 00:02.961
and it turns out to be so much better

00:02.962 --> 00:04.521
than you could have ever imagined?

00:04.522 --> 00:07.881
That's what happened to me today when I was craving lasagna soup.

00:07.882 --> 00:09.601
It's getting a little chilly outside,

00:09.602 --> 00:11.841
so that means it's soup season.

00:11.842 --> 00:13.721
I started by making my mozzarella

00:13.722 --> 00:17.121
by combining some citric acid and rennet,

00:17.122 --> 00:19.081
heating it up, cutting it into cubes,

00:19.082 --> 00:21.841
letting the way separate, and then straining it.

00:21.842 --> 00:23.961
Return my curds back to hot water,

00:23.962 --> 00:25.841
let them melt, stretch them out,

00:25.842 --> 00:27.361
warm my ball of mozzarella,

00:27.362 --> 00:30.721
and set that aside while I got started on my pasta dough.

00:30.722 --> 00:32.321
I combined flour, eggs,

00:32.322 --> 00:34.401
olive oil, and a pinch of salt.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.441
Started needing my dough, but got tired,

00:36.442 --> 00:37.721
so lucky took over.

00:37.722 --> 00:41.601
I let that rest for about an hour while I got started on my sauce.

00:41.602 --> 00:44.801
I chopped up some celery, moved on to some onion,

00:44.802 --> 00:49.561
and lastly some carrot. I seared off some ground beef and ground pork,

00:49.562 --> 00:51.361
then added my celery, onion,

00:51.362 --> 00:52.121
and carrot.

00:52.122 --> 00:56.161
Let that saute for a few minutes before adding in my tomato paste.

00:56.162 --> 00:59.361
I let that go, added in some crushed tomatoes,

00:59.362 --> 01:01.781
some stock, some Italian spices.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.600
While that was simmering and getting to know each other,

01:04.601 --> 01:06.161
I rolled out my pasta,

01:06.162 --> 01:10.241
cut it into a regular shapes before I transfer that over to the sauce,

01:10.242 --> 01:12.241
and let it cook in the sauce.

01:12.242 --> 01:15.961
After about four minutes, started slicing up my mozzarella,

01:15.962 --> 01:17.441
putting that in the sauce as well

01:17.442 --> 01:20.201
so it Could melt. Once the mozzarella had melted,

01:20.202 --> 01:21.441
it was time to plate.

01:21.442 --> 01:25.061
I topped this with some Parmesan cheese and some spring onions.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.880
This hit the spot and was absolutely stunning.

01:27.881 --> 01:29.584
And I can't wait for colder weather.
