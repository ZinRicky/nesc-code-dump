Hey, mama goose,

00:02.241 --> 00:04.341
you're gonna go down to clean some water.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.740
Haha!

00:15.320 --> 00:16.120
Oh,

00:17.640 --> 00:19.620
they look like fast friends.

00:30.040 --> 00:32.434
Ã…h.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.460
Here's the initial reaction.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.740
She's moving in.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.080
She's like, wow,

00:42.081 --> 00:44.581
you've got a pretty nice house.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.900
Is that a real Willow?

00:47.480 --> 00:49.500
So it turns out they are in love.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.380
Papa Goose took her to the water.

00:57.080 --> 01:00.580
Dad, stop singing, friend.

01:22.280 --> 01:27.500
Haha!

01:33.200 --> 01:37.260
Haha!
