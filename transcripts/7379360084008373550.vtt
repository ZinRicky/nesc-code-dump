00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.480
iâ€™ve done a lot of things to finally get comfortable in my body and like

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:08.080
the person that I am

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:09.960
ironically one of the things that actually helps me

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.360
when I'm feeling kinda bad about myself

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:13.000
is thinking about people on Ed Twitter

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:17.800
because they at one point or maybe still use me in my fat body as fat spo

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:18.720
which is basically like

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:20.880
inspiration to starve themselves so they don't look like me

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:21.680
insane anyway

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:23.000
don't go looking for this genuinely 

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.200
one of the worst parts of the internet anyway

00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:27.600
it was like a summer where I spent a lot of time looking at Ed Twitter accounts

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.160
because I needed to block all of them

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:34.440
and it made me so sad because no one was good enough for these

00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:35.640
even the smallest

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:37.240
thinnest people I've literally ever seen

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:39.760
there was some 15 year old on a private Twitter calling her fat

00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:41.800
like that was one of the final times that it clicked for me

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:42.680
as long as I live

00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:48.100
there is genuinely nothing that I can do to make everyone like no

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.840
if I'm not gonna win why would I even play the game

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:53.760
because I know that there is no possible way for me to live up to that standard

00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:56.160
I don't adhere to it at all

00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:58.320
and there is something so freeing

00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:00.880
about knowing that you will never be good enough for them

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:03.960
genuinely the only thing that you can do is think about how you feel

00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:04.641
about how you look 

00:01:04.642 --> 00:01:05.000
figure out

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:06.814
if you can be comfortable the way you are
