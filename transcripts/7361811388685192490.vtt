00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.100
Driving my daughter to school,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.580
and she said to me out of the blue, mama.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.800
So, yes, baby.

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.901
She said, I'm the ugliest girl I know.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.500
And I said,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.080
huh?

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.040
And she was like, yeah,

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:17.261
I look like a boy with long hair.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.840
And my brain went to,

00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:19.321
oh, my god,

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:20.661
you're six. Why?

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.040
Where is this coming from?

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:22.641
Who said this?

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:24.801
But I said, when people make fun of me,

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:26.081
it's. That's what they use.

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:29.381
They say that I look like a boy, or I'm too masculine, or I'm too.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.960
I have too many opinions.

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:33.001
I. My body is too strong.

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.241
And I said to her,

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:37.201
I said, do you see me growing my hair so? No, mama.

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:39.381
I said, do you see me changing my body?

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.160
No, mama.

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:42.641
Do you see me changing the way I present myself to the world?

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.401
No, mama.

00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:46.201
Do you see me selling out arenas all over the world?

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:47.221
Yes, mama.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.460
Okay,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.540
so, baby girl,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.660
we don't change.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.740
We take the gravel in the shell, and we make a pearl.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.480
And we help other people to change

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:02.301
so that they can see more kinds of beauty.
