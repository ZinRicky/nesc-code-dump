00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.080
Here's everything I made today to make sure we have food to eat.

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:05.001
I started off the day with some protein

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.641
scrambled eggs from my backyard chickens

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:08.761
and then had a bowl of the only cereal I would buy

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:10.641
because it's got friendly organic

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:12.841
made with only real ingredients and unrefined sugar.

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:15.841
It's also gluten free with prebiotic fiber from casaba root.

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:17.641
It's so good and I had it with raw milk.

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.881
Next I shaped a freshly milled sourdough bowl

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:21.361
that I had started the day before.

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:23.201
After fermenting all night at room temperature,

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:26.001
I did a quick counter, then shaped it into a round

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.021
and sewed it up to do its final proof in a flowered banaton.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.880
Later I made my OG banana bread.

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:33.081
It's gluten free free and made with fermented buckwheat.

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:36.001
Fun fact this is one of the first recipes I ever developed.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.361
It took me so many times to get it right and it's honestly so perfect.

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:40.601
You should give it a try too!

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:42.921
The buckwheat ferments for 24 hours on the counter

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:45.961
and the final batter whips up in one bowl in just a few minutes.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.201
Flowed up with healthy fats from pasture raised eggs

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:49.121
and shredded coconut

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:51.681
and tastes delicious with coconut oil or raw butter.

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:52.561
Towards dinner time,

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:55.601
I prep some 100% grass fed beef from my parents farm

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:59.001
by combining 4 pounds of meat with the variety of dried spices, herbs,

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:00.201
salt and pepper, eggs,

00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:01.481
raw milk, and shredded cheese.

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.881
I bake The meatballs at 4:25 for 20 minutes.

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:04.641
While those baked,

00:01:04.642 --> 00:01:07.641
I made some pickled onions and then started on preparing a Greek salad.

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:09.161
I threw a bunch of chopped basil in

00:01:09.162 --> 00:01:12.221
and then whisked up a simple salad dressing of pickled onion, vinegar,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.440
olive oil, Dijon,

00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:16.161
and salt and pepper. This salad was so fresh and crisp.

00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:17.801
Dinner was freshly milled iron cream,

00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:20.319
sourdough, and a Greek salad with meatballs on top.
