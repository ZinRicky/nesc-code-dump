00:00.440 --> 00:02.580
So now has been wanting this bag,

00:02.840 --> 00:05.000
and I decided to go get it for her today,

00:05.001 --> 00:06.941
cause she's the best and she deserves it.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.860
So I'm at Bottega kind of waiting around.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.720
The guy who's helping me was packing it all up

00:12.721 --> 00:14.401
and then walked past his jewelry store.

00:14.402 --> 00:14.881
And I was like, oh,

00:14.882 --> 00:15.721
she needs jewelry, too.

00:15.722 --> 00:17.221
So I went and got her some jewelry.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.760
And she's been wanting this bag for a while now.

00:20.761 --> 00:23.161
She. We went and looked at it a couple different times

00:23.162 --> 00:24.341
while she was pregnant,

00:24.560 --> 00:26.880
and she couldn't make up her mind.

00:26.881 --> 00:30.881
And I just. Sometimes she's too nice and doesn't want to get stuff.

00:30.882 --> 00:34.181
So I just took upon myself to just make it happen today.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.200
And look at her opening the bag.

00:37.201 --> 00:39.121
I didn't know what color she wanted.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.001
I forgot. And so I just went with my gut.

00:41.002 --> 00:42.201
And I hopefully did it right.

00:42.202 --> 00:44.581
Well, I think I did, because her face says it all.

00:45.040 --> 00:45.920
Look at that bag.

00:45.921 --> 00:46.561
Wow, wow,

00:46.562 --> 00:46.961
wow, wow,

00:46.962 --> 00:47.761
wow, wow, wow.

00:47.762 --> 00:49.221
And then we open up the jewelry.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.480
I just wanted to do something kind of simple.

00:51.481 --> 00:54.701
And so I just got her a simple, um,

00:54.880 --> 00:56.400
petite diamond ring

00:56.401 --> 00:59.121
that she could stack and layer with all of her other jewelry.

00:59.122 --> 01:02.261
The top one I got for her around Christmas time.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.763
And yes, this is
