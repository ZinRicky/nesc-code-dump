00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
I'm a single mother to 4 kids,

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:05.761
and obviously money gets tight and I needed to find extra income.

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:07.361
And this is not some fucking scam.

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:09.281
I'm not gonna sell you shit in this video,

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:11.301
but you can listen if you wanna learn something.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.000
I literally just contacted the Small Business Association for my state.

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.521
I live in Colorado. Contacted the Small Business Association,

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:20.001
was like, hey,

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:23.481
I need to do something. They set me up with a counselor,

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:24.561
like a business consultant,

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:24.921
basically,

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:28.201
like a woman who's been in business who can offer me counseling and,

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:29.621
like, resources and stuff.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.720
Hooked up with her and she said, oh,

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:33.481
there's actually this grant going on right now.

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:35.301
If you take these three classes,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.760
will give you 12 dollars

00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:39.121
to reimburse you for all the startup costs for your business.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:40.441
And I was like, shut the fuck up.

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:41.701
So sure enough,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.740
she set me up that day, I took the first class.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.360
The next week, I had another meeting with her,

00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:47.481
she set me up for the second class,

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:48.441
I had another meeting with her,

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:49.521
and she set me up for the third class.

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:50.201
And I mean, like a meet,

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:51.241
like, it was like a virtual.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:52.121
Like, I was in my pajamas.

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:52.521
I was like, hey,

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:53.481
what's up? She was like, okay,

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:56.161
here's the next class. Click through that shit.

00:00:56.162 --> 00:00:58.081
And then it gave me money to.

00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:00.761
It reimburse me all the costs for, um,

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:03.081
like a business address, like to Get a PO box,

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:04.721
my website, uh,

00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:06.201
somebody to build the website,

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:08.041
a computer. So

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:09.161
now all I have to do today

00:01:09.162 --> 00:01:11.621
is submit all my receipts for the things that I've paid,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.200
and then the government is gonna give me a grant,

00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:15.481
reimbursing me for all that money.

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:18.001
So it cost me zero dollars to start this business.

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:21.961
And pretty soon, I will have my website up and running,

00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:23.361
and you'll be able to buy products from it,

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:26.361
and I'll be able to support my family more.

00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:29.441
So you don't. It doesn't always have to be scammy.

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:31.081
You don't have to have everything figured out.

00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:32.681
You can sometimes just start with a phone call,

00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:35.101
start with a question, and see where it leads you.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160
And I'm, like,

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:40.401
beyond proud of myself. So I wanna encourage you.

00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:42.141
You can fucking do it.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.656
You can fucking do it.
