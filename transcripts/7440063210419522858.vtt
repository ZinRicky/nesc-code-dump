There are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to being low income,

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.361
and that's kind of why I wanted to start talking about it more,

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:05.441
because it is a taboo topic.

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:07.281
The only reason we were able to afford a home

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:10.121
is because my husband worked his butt off while I was in college

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:11.281
to save up for a down payment.

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:12.321
And by the sheer Grace of god,

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:14.121
we found a house that was an estate sale

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:16.080
and that was dirt cheap and needed a lot of fixing up.

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:17.401
You even bought it without me seeing it

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:19.161
because the housing market was that insane at the time.

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:22.161
My county's low income limit is 66 grand a year.

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:23.321
We make way less than that.

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:24.641
We live paycheck to paycheck,

00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:26.881
and we don't get to do all the fun things that we would love to do.

00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:28.521
But that doesn't mean that we can't own a home

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:29.921
or we can't have nice things.

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:31.481
And maybe we won't always be low income,

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:33.601
but I have no reason to lie about my financial status,

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:35.601
especially because there's shame and stigma around it.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.688
Cheers to us who are low income but make it work!
