00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.520
watch how easy it is to wipe out this dirty pan

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:06.641
I'm literally using a baby wipe and only one hand

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:08.001
cause I'm recording with the other hand

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.601
and look like nothing was ever cooked in there

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:12.061
and you know what I did cook in there

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.000
chicken thighs

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.841
greasy skin and bone in chicken thighs

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:18.081
and they came out like nothing

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:19.001
look at this Mac and cheese

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.201
it's bubbling hot

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.341
loaded with cheese

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.080
I cooked it on the stove and then moved it to finish in the oven

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:28.761
look how easy it slides out the

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.401
I'm not even using two hands

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:32.641
and nothing sticks at all

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:33.681
nothing like brand new

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:35.661
like straight out of the cabinet practically

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.360
they're super space shaving because the handle comes off

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:39.361
which I thought was weird

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:42.821
but it's super easy how it clicks on and clicks off

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.680
it is compatible with all of the pans

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:47.001
so you can take it off of one

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:48.181
put it on the other

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.520
and then for

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:52.041
especially if you have a house with little kids

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:54.481
you can just safely set the handle off to the side

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:56.481
so it's not like little hands are gonna grab it

00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:58.161
and be in any danger while you're cooking

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:01.221
I that part is really amazing for me

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.280
the handle is really sturdy though

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:07.121
you can still carry the heavy hot pots over to the water to drain if you need to

00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:08.681
or use them in any other way

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.721
also since it has these

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:12.621
this clippable handle

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.240
you can put things in the oven

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:17.041
and you don't need to worry about where your hot pad is

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.561
and no little hands can reach in there and accidentally grab it

00:01:19.562 --> 00:01:22.441
you just use it to pull the item out of the oven

00:01:22.442 --> 00:01:23.841
or to push it back in the oven

00:01:23.842 --> 00:01:24.961
you clip it off

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:26.961
and again you just set it safely to the side

00:01:26.962 --> 00:01:28.221
not only that

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.240
but because of the handle

00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:32.981
they stack neatly and space saving inside of each other

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.480
this set is amazing

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:35.359
