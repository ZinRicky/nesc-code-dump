00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.120
I don't buy processed cereals for my children

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.440
because they're filled with ingredients

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.560
that I don't consider food.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.400
They've been processed and refined in the lab

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.800
and loaded with sugar and glycosate

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.760
sprayed flour.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120
Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal will light up the nucleus

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.160
acumbent region of the brain like a Christmas tree,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.580
creating a drug like effect.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.280
Surge of dopamine creates addiction

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.080
and the incredible desire for more sugar.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.040
Ever been able to stop at just one small bowl?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.120
There's a reason for that.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.080
It's not our children's fault for bad behavior,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.040
learning disabilities,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.400
yo yo. Mood swings are unhealthy,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.480
weight gain when they're fed these types of food.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.120
When I make wheat products for my family,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.280
I always use eincorn

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.720
because it's the oldest form of wheat

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.920
still in its original form.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.640
Today's modern wheat has been hybridized,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.120
thus the gluten is much higher

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.600
and it has a different genetic makeup,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.440
causing many kids

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.260
and adults to have gluten intolerances.
