You ever smell a scent and get reminded of a very specific dessert?

00:04.201 --> 00:09.021
Olivia Bell Elixir has top notes of raspberry and cocoa butter.

00:09.160 --> 00:12.960
This warm and fruity mix immediately brings a smile to my face

00:12.961 --> 00:16.981
and makes me think of a little chocolate cake and raspberry coolies.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.080
After making my raspberry coolies,

00:19.081 --> 00:20.481
I chopped up some chocolate

00:20.482 --> 00:22.841
and let that melt with some butter on the stove

00:22.842 --> 00:25.801
while I got started on whipping up some eggs and sugar

00:25.802 --> 00:28.641
with a pinch of salt. Once my chocolate had melted,

00:28.642 --> 00:30.961
I put some flour in my egg mixture

00:30.962 --> 00:33.401
and poured my melted chocolate all up in there

00:33.402 --> 00:36.881
before gently folding it in until no streaks remain.

00:36.882 --> 00:38.721
I poured that in my little ramekin,

00:38.722 --> 00:41.881
let that bake, and topped it with my raspberry coolies.

00:41.882 --> 00:44.521
This is exactly what the scent reminds me of.

00:44.522 --> 00:45.441
Thank you, lancome,

00:45.442 --> 00:47.023
for partnering with me on this.
