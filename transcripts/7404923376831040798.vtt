00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
If you're like, I wanna fucking start a business,

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.601
the only thing that's holding me back is I don't know what to do.

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:05.581
And I kinda want somebody to hold my fucking hand.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.020
I'll hold your fucking hand.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.000
So let's go. Last summer I got accepted into this, like,

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.881
program with a small business association.

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.321
And it helped kind of literally

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:17.881
hold my hand and walk me through the process of starting an LLC

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:21.961
so that I could start earning income as a side hustle and grow that

00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:24.681
and benefit from all the tax breaks that you get as a business owner.

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:26.881
And it just allowed me to earn money

00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:29.241
in ways that I could work around my schedule

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:32.081
for my children. And I've been very successful at that

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:34.161
and I've been very happy with what I've done.

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:35.841
And a lot of women have reached out to me and said,

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:37.121
I wanna leave too. I need.

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:39.821
I need to figure out how I can get my finances in order.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.940
And I have started a little challenge.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.300
It's a 30 day challenge. The

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.100
you know where to sign up.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.920
And basically I have kind of

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:54.721
taken everything I Learned from the Small Business Association

00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:55.881
and what I've done, all the like,

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:58.801
different little businesses and side hustles that I've done.

00:00:58.802 --> 00:01:01.321
I partnered with my friend who owns a business.

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:04.701
She runs a very successful advertising company.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.120
So over 30 days, you will learn how to start your own business.

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:11.161
Like you Will start an LLC.

00:01:11.162 --> 00:01:13.601
One of the lessons that we will teach you

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:15.701
is how to go to your secretary of state website,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.480
find LLC. This is not how to become an MLM or master resale rights.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.581
We're not gonna like.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.960
This isn't like somebody else's course that we're just, like,

00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:26.281
teaching you. This is real shit.

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:29.141
There's gonna be a live seminar every week.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.200
So for 30 days you're gonna get a 20 minute recorded lesson.

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:35.961
Either me, myself or Nikki is gonna be, like,

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:36.921
teaching you. That day.

00:01:36.922 --> 00:01:37.361
There'll be, like,

00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:39.081
a little bit of homework for you to do.

00:01:39.082 --> 00:01:40.161
And what we're trying to do

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:42.441
is get you into the habit of working on your business

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:44.841
every single day. And when you're starting up a business,

00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:45.961
there really is, you know,

00:01:45.962 --> 00:01:47.661
some time that you have to put into it.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.600
And by the end of this 30 days,

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:52.601
you're gonna be very confident in the skills that you have

00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:54.201
in the business, that you have,

00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:57.021
the offerings that your business provides,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.520
and least have all the skills to start making sales.

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:04.121
The rest is up to you. So if that sounds interesting to you,

00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:06.201
for 30 days, you'll be hearing from me,

00:02:06.202 --> 00:02:07.881
seeing me. And then every week,

00:02:07.882 --> 00:02:09.841
once a week, there will be a live session.

00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:11.241
If you can't attend the live session,

00:02:11.242 --> 00:02:13.421
it'll be recorded and you'll get it in your email.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320
So I really, really,

00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:17.841
genuinely wanna help women get on their feet.

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:20.361
And Take their power back.

00:02:20.362 --> 00:02:22.941
