00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.940
We're almost at the end of staging at Airbnb

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.540
RV here on the farm,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.700
and we have one more thing that we need to get done.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.340
Um, we had a.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.200
We actually got a free pillow set with the.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.440
Already came with the mattress,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.480
and we upgraded the mattress.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.140
So I thought, why not upgrade the pillows too, because

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.180
it's hot balls in here.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.300
We don't have the air conditioning on yet.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.760
Still waiting for the wiring to be wired up.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.320
But we're gonna be in here for a few minutes

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.160
just checking out, um,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.560
the pillows that arrived today.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.440
So we needed to upgrade the pillows

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.160
as along with the mattress,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.680
we did get free pillows with the RV,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.760
but they were like these weird,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.480
cheapest, like,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.760
display pillows I've ever seen.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.680
So I thought,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.380
why not go on TikTok shop

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.980
and look to see if there's any pillows on there.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.520
So in there.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.960
Like, they must be compressed in there,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.420
cause this is two queen pillows inside here.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.440
So like, yeah,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.000
this is a small box,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.960
a vacuum seal.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.480
Um, kinda break the vacuum.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.660
Oh, breeze open some windows.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.240
That feels nice.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.540
It was like freezing.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.500
Now we have this warm front come through.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.560
I know, it's so hot in here.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.240
I have the heat on here

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.000
in here and I will save it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.020
And now it's hot. Okay,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.120
these are the three pillows that I got with the RV.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.060
They're like,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.580
like little bit of foam

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.480
mixed With the polyester lumpy.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.160
And that's not gonna be satisfying to like to,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.520
I guess. Here it feels.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.780
It feels like down.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.900
Very nice and soft.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.700
Pillow is nice and soft.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.060
It's hundred percent cotton

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.220
and the inside is a polyester gel.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.200
It feels so soft and like form fitting.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.900
And see, it just bounces right back.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.180
Definitely an upgrade compared to the.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.380
The cheap, this clay pillows we got for free.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.420
Nothing. Spray on this one.
