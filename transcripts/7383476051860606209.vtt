00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.892
this room has been straight up torturing me 

00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:02.840
for the last six months

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:05.120
and I won't lie, I got a bit over it at times

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:06.080
but today I'm happy

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:08.179
I'm fkn elated actually because I can 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.560
officially say she's done

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:12.600
this is our very mid-century split-level dual lounge

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.600
which is another way of saying it's two rooms in one

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:17.400
with a lot of different surfaces and spaces to think about

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.400
so I've tried to make it functional first and foremost

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:20.840
hence why there's a bar in it

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:23.760
I've tried to use colour both to delineate the two spaces

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.080
but also to tie them together

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.440
I leaned on white primarily and one half of the room

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:29.320
because I wanted the view to speak for itself

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:31.520
and I wanted the darker half of the room to feel cosy

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.920
sophisticated and elevated

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:34.120
we've got a mix of old and new

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:35.720
some objects are upcycled

00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:38.412
and some are from each of our parents or grandparents 

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:39.460
who aren't related by the way 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.080
and after a really long time of struggling in the space

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:43.960
I'm actually quite pleased at how it's come together

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.240
I'm sure you'll let me know what you think

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.960
actually I just realised we're not quite done

00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:49.040
cause one day that fireplace will get replaced

00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:50.507
but good enough is good enough

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:51.780
 and that's enough for now
