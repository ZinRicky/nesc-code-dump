I get to keep up with my kids all summer in these halal shorts because,

like, they're double shorts.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.240
There's deep pockets on this inner shorts that's, like,

00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:17.181
tight and fit to your body so nothing's gonna be falling out.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.440
They have a tight,

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:20.561
stretchy waistband, and you feel like you're, like,

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:21.681
