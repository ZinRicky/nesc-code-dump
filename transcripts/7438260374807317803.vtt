00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
Today I'm gonna make a steak and kidney pie,

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:03.161
but I couldn't find any kidneys,

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:05.801
so I'm gonna settle with just steak.

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:08.201
This is something I ate all the time growing up in England.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:09.561
Even when I go home to visit, I'm.

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:11.021
I eat a lot of steak pies.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.180
Steak and L pie, steak and kidney pie,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.000
Guinness pie. They're all really good,

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:17.921
and it's just not something you can buy here in the US,

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:19.441
so I have to make it myself,

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:20.681
and it is pretty time consuming,

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:22.281
but it's well worth it. Here,

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:26.521
I made enough pie crust to make four pies.

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:28.561
If I just did tops or two pies.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.301
If I did a bottom and a top,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.760
then they reminded me about saving me pudding,

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:36.581
which is not a pudding, but it is a pudding

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.840
in a dish and put them in the oven,

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.361
and that kind of made me wanna do that, too,

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:45.401
but I need to calm down and just get this one done.

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:47.681
I have ADHD brain, so when I'm cooking something,

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:50.221
I'm constantly thinking about something else I can cook.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.000
I put carrots in this and onions,

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.021
and I've used some bone broth that I made previously,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.680
and then I rolled up the pie crust.

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.881
The pie crust was sitting in the fridge overnight

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:02.181
because I actually burnt the first pie filling

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.040
because I was trying to do gardening

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.921
and cooking pie filling at the same time.

00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:06.441
It takes, like,

00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:09.661
three hours to cook The pies filling to make it soft.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.600
So in my ADHD brain, I was like,

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.121
I'm just gonna go outside and weed the garden.

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:14.561
And then I was out there for like,

00:01:14.562 --> 00:01:15.361
45 minutes

00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:19.161
and didn't realize that the pie filling was burning on the stove.

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:21.281
So we end up going to Texas Roadhouse,

00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:23.321
which is just crazy, cause we never eat out,

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:26.161
but my husband's like, let's just go to Texas Roadhouse.

00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:28.401
And then put two pie crust in the freezer,

00:01:28.402 --> 00:01:29.441
and I put the one in the fridge.

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:31.813
And then I remade it the next day, and it was perfect.
