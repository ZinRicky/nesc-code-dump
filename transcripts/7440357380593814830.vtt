00:01.160 --> 00:03.720
I am finally vertical again

00:03.721 --> 00:06.661
after being under the weather for a couple of days.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.840
I'm prepping some things tonight in the kitchen,

00:09.841 --> 00:15.161
because tomorrow The New York Times is coming for an interview

00:15.162 --> 00:18.641
and photographs and some recipe content.

00:18.642 --> 00:22.981
So I'm getting things prepped for that and into the fridge.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.360
The next morning, I realized that I needed some mustard

00:26.361 --> 00:29.021
for one of my recipes that we were shooting today.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.480
So I hurried and made some.

00:31.481 --> 00:33.601
I added some turmeric to this,

00:33.602 --> 00:37.321
and it turned out to be the most gorgeous bright yellow color.

00:37.322 --> 00:40.101
I loved it so much. And then we got rolling.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.640
They came, we started cooking.

00:42.641 --> 00:46.661
They were photographing and interviewing simultaneously,

00:47.080 --> 00:49.880
and I think it went well. Obviously,

00:49.881 --> 00:53.501
you never know on these types of things until the article comes out,

00:53.520 --> 00:55.720
but for me, it went well.

00:55.721 --> 00:57.121
And then after that,

00:57.122 --> 01:00.801
we did some photographs in front of the AGA and in the kitchen.

01:00.802 --> 01:05.841
And then we were off for a farm tour LED by Daniel.

01:05.842 --> 01:08.601
We went up to one of the lookout spots on the ranch,

01:08.602 --> 01:10.701
and this is one of my favourite views.

01:11.120 --> 01:14.140
So beautiful. You can see everything from up here.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.940
And then we went to the dairy and met some milk cows.

01:18.480 --> 01:22.784
We had some photographs with Daniel and the cows, and it was
