00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.535
if you're feeling kind of frustrated 

00:00:01.536 --> 00:00:02.480
with the pool renovation

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:03.680
and you're just hanging in there

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:05.280
waiting for that final result

00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:06.516
can I just say same 

00:00:06.517 --> 00:00:08.000
I miss life as I knew it

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.246
but I'm pretty sure that this is the final update 

00:00:10.247 --> 00:00:11.280
before *the* final update

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:13.200
so settle in cause we've got a bit of ground to cover

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:14.794
in previous updates we've dealt with some of 

00:00:14.795 --> 00:00:15.680
the more aesthetic stuff

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.080
like the tiling and the coping

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:18.520
and I can't believe I'm actually saying it

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:20.080
but the end is officially in sight

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:21.160
but first we have to deal with

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:21.640
you know 

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:22.440
the actual pool

00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:23.360
First order of business

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:24.939
was to hit the surface with a really good 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.880
cleaning and prep product

00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:26.680
to get rid of any residue 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.302
and oh my goodness this process was more satisfying 

00:00:29.303 --> 00:00:30.200
than my wedding night

00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:32.094
so this product is called True Prep and we 

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:33.680
purchased it from a brand name Cotec

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:35.536
but can I just say that Grant and his team 

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:36.400
have been phenomenal

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:37.040
a few weeks back

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:38.500
they came out and did a site visit and 

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:39.960
recommended what products we would need

00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:41.400
they even sent across data sheets

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:44.200
and technical specifications and tutorials to watch

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:44.760
which you know

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:46.452
naturally I forwarded to my husband 

00:00:46.453 --> 00:00:48.520
and after a lot of phone calls and questions

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:50.437
Cotec made us feel really confident that we 

00:00:50.438 --> 00:00:51.440
knew what we were doing

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:52.840
which is a bloody miracle

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:54.398
we've also had another pool professional 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.376
coming out and checking on our progress each week 

00:00:56.377 --> 00:00:57.960
and I think I did mention that in part 1

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.080
but just to reiterate if you're insane like me

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:01.536
and you're thinking of undertaking a 

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:02.520
project of this magnitude

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:04.587
please reach out to your local network of experts 

00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:04.960
side note

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:06.264
but a lot of people have been concerned 

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.080
that my pools gonna crack

00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:08.600
or even pop up out of the ground

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.120
and I'm not gonna lie - valid concern

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:11.320
I've been worried about it too

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.400
just to put your mind at rest

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:14.243
before we started we did check that we have 

00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:15.040
a hydrostatic valve

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.976
which should hopefully make that not happen 

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:18.720
anyway if you remember in the previous update

00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:20.398
we were making holes in the bottom of the pool

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:21.158
 terrifying I know 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.320
and now it's time to fix them

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.664
and we're using another product 

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:24.840
from Cotec called Tuff Floor

00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:26.240
and this is your trigger warning okay

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:28.720
cause apparently it's gotta look worse before it looks better

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.640
I always tell myself when I'm doing projects like this

00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:32.640
so you gotta break a few eggs to make an omelette right

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:33.160
but yeah

00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:34.637
it's gonna look pretty rough after 

00:01:34.638 --> 00:01:36.200
but we've got to fix that pool cancer

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:37.160
the way I understand it

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:39.640
pool cancer is essentially where the plaster is cracking

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:42.160
and pulling away from the actual concrete shell of the pool

00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:43.840
and that can be really problematic obviously

00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:45.560
cause you don't want chlorinated pool water

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:47.360
getting down into that concrete shell

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:47.962
or something 

00:01:47.963 --> 00:01:49.120
And when the holes were filled

00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:50.706
our nephew came to lend a hand sanding 

00:01:50.707 --> 00:01:51.560
cause she's a big job

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:54.200
he must have heard that I'm only inviting helpers to the pool party

00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.880
but seriously the last six weeks have been so physically demanding

00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:59.280
Mark and I are exhausted and we were so grateful for the help

00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:01.280
the next step was to mix up a product called Trowel-It

00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:02.520
which was actually so fun

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:03.600
the way that I think of this is

00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:05.800
it's like putting on a primer underneath your foundation

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:06.454
you know what I mean

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:06.880
 so hopefully

00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:08.640
it's gonna make my poolâ€™s pores looks smaller

00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:11.080
so that her makeup fits nicer and last longer

00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:12.440
K so one question I've had a lot is

00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:14.760
what are we gonna do with the weird gap underneath the tiles

00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:16.640
where our previous tiles went down to

00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:17.840
we kinda had two options

00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.640
we could either hand cut thousands of tiles to fit in the gap

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:22.680
which wasn't really an option if you ask me

00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:24.960
or we could fill it with this stuff before sanding and painting

00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:26.560
there was a question mark over a third option

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:29.720
of maybe gouging out that gap to make it big enough to fit a full tile

00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:31.760
but we're advised that maybe it wasn't the best option

00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:33.400
and also I'm running out of fks to give

00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:34.960
so I'm just gonna take these easy road

00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:35.960
so we're gonna fill that gap

00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:38.240
and also cover up all of the worst spots in the pool

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.840
which turns out to be most of it

00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:41.541
including literally all of the spa 

00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:42.320
I don't know why

00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:43.520
but the spa I was so rough

00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:45.920
there were literally gouges taken out of the wall anyway

00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:47.080
so when the pool man came back

00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:49.480
he told us that we might have gone a bit overboard with that step

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:50.520
but I don't actually mind

00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:51.162
cause guess what?

00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:53.088
 it's the last thing we need to do before we paint 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.544
okay I lied 

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:54.760
we have to sand everything again

00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:55.306
then we paint 

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:56.400
and I'm posting in real time

00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:57.884
so I'm so sorry but I promise the 

00:02:57.885 --> 00:02:59.326
next updates gonna be a goodie
