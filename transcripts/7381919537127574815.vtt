00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.803
ask what can I do to be more forgiving of myself and more in love more easily

00:00:05.903 --> 00:00:09.283
how to fall in love more easily or be in love more easily

00:00:09.703 --> 00:00:13.923
accept my wife for who she is

00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:15.483
a champion who she is

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:18.923
not make her a version of that I think she's supposed to be

00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:26.183
but rather embrace and highlight and champion and elevate who and what she is

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:27.683
and when I do that

00:00:27.983 --> 00:00:28.543
which um

00:00:28.544 --> 00:00:30.183
I feel like I do pretty well

00:00:30.184 --> 00:00:32.203
but always a work in progress

00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:34.143
um you find that you're in love

00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:35.623
you're not comparing her to what

00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:37.023
the version that you think she's supposed to be

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:40.183
or to someone else's spouse or partner right

00:00:40.184 --> 00:00:42.263
um I think you fall in love much more easily

00:00:42.264 --> 00:00:45.143
when you accept the person that you are trying to be in love with

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.340
wow that's pretty profound
