if you're having a third baby and you're older

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:05.160
two or much older this is me telling you that it's gonna be okay

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:06.600
it's gonna be more than okay

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:08.760
I never would have thought that my youngest would catch up

00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:10.880
and be as close to his older siblings as he is

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:12.500
and I know thirds get a bad rap

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.440
but that third baby is gonna bring everyone together

00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:17.320
and your older kids are gonna become their best selves

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:19.080
because they have somebody to look out for

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:21.080
don't get me wrong three is a lot of kids

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:25.260
but the love added is exponential and definitely makes it all worth it
