00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.820
For generations,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.120
indigenous women, girls and two spirited have endured misogynistic,

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:28.301
degrading, marginalizing and harmful narratives,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.580
systematically denying our worth and withholding protections from us.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:43.020
This mural serves as a direct and profound act of resistance,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.940
liberation and reclamation of our own narrative.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.700
She dismantles this harmful discourse in a real,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.740
beautiful and unapologetic way.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.840
This is the era of matriarchy where we lead,

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:08.661
we heal and we thrive. As indigenous women,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.520
we are matriarchs, we're activists,

00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:17.241
we're leaders, were storytellers,

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:20.501
were mothers and grandmothers and aunties and allies,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.380
were artists and artisans.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.060
Elders were judges and lawyers and teachers and nurses and caregivers,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.260
were students and academics,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.100
were leaders, were chief and councils.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.860
And yes, some of us are even ministers of the Crown.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.420
To our women, girls and two spirit relatives,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.180
I hope that when you see this mural,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.660
you feel it resonate deeply,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.020
both in body and spirit in how truly powerful and beautiful you are.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.120
We are more than what we've been constructed as

00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:10.341
and we are more than what is done to our bodies.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.180
Let this mural remind everyone of us,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.760
but especially indigenous women,

00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:21.821
girls and two spirited relatives that you are seen,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.580
you are respected,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.140
you are celebrated.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.080
This art is for you

00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:35.821
in honor of all that you are and all that you continue to become.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.700
You are loved. Big watch.
