00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
The Hollywood reporter recently wrote an article about tribewives.

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.361
It was interviewed for the article,

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:08.481
and I absolutely love the quote that they chose.

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:13.021
I wanted to be the mom I dreamed of instead of the wife he wanted.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.320
I was searching my soul into why motherhood,

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:23.601
while it was something I had dreamed of since I could think,

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:25.801
some might say I was groomed into this life,

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:29.721
but that's another story. But why was I not finding the joy

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:31.401
that I thought I was supposed to find in motherhood?

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:32.841
Why did it seem like so much work?

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:36.461
Why was I so tired? Why was I unable to, like,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.600
not lose my temper with my kids?

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.440
why was. Why are two year olds able to get under my skin?

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:44.161
You know what I mean? Like,

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:46.361
what's going on here that I can't keep my cool?

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:47.921
They're my children that I love.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:49.881
What's going on? That I'm so frustrated.

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:53.241
I'm waking up at such anxiety and frustration levels.

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:54.721
And when I did some soul searching,

00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:57.401
I realized I'm not able to mother them the way that I want.

00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:01.841
My focus as a tribe wife is my husband and how to keep him happy.

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:03.481
And that means keep the kids quiet.

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:04.161
And that means

00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:07.241
I don't get to mother them and enjoy them the way that I want.

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:08.841
I'm looking for ways to escape

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:10.681
and to leave the house and to do other things.

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:12.761
And so I realized I had To pick.

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:16.041
I got to that point. I had to pick my husband or my kids,

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:18.041
and I chose my kids.

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:20.841
I would rather my kids have the mother that they deserve

00:01:20.842 --> 00:01:22.801
because I brought them into the world.

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:24.421
I owe that to them.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.700
Then cling to a failing relationship

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.457
just because I brought kids into the world with him.
