00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
I can't explain why,

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:05.261
but every time December rolls around I start craving pavlovas.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.160
Baked them multiple times all throughout the month,

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.881
but today it's my first.

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:13.201
I start by whipping my egg whites until soft peaks form

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:15.661
before gradually adding in my sugar.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.400
Once that all looks glossy,

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.301
I add in my vanilla paste and let that go for another minute.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.160
This point I add in my cream of tartar and some cornstarch

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.081
before folding that all in

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:29.761
and transferring that over to a baking sheet.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.641
Make sure there's a good dip in the middle,

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:34.201
and then put it in the oven at 3:50,

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:37.421
but then immediately turn the heat down to 200.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.400
Let that bake for about an hour and a half

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:41.921
while I get started on my cherry compote.

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:43.001
While that's reducing,

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.201
I make a quick whipped cream by combining some heavy cream,

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:47.941
vanilla, and powdered sugar.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.520
Once that's all ready to go,

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:51.901
I take out my cooled pavlova,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.720
spread the heavy cream on top and the cherry compote as well.

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:59.061
I love a good orange zest in my cherry compote.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.905
Garnish it with some Rosemary and there we go!
