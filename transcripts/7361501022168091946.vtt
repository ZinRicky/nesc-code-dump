00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
if you invite a man out on a date

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.361
maybe grab a drink

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:06.161
grab some lunch, dinner

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:09.321
he should not have to pay the entire tab

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:10.861
now before you get angry

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.240
put yourself in his shoes.

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.981
if he asks you out on a date

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.760
would you expect him to leave you with an entire tab

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.001
no, no you wouldn't

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:22.561
so why are you inviting him out expecting him to pay the entire Bill

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:24.161
if you ask someone out

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.221
you generally pay the Bill

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.600
YOU are asking them out

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:28.601
or you could split it

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:31.161
but generally if you're asking someone out

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:33.881
you're inviting them out to treat them

00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:35.561
This really shouldn't be a debate

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:37.081
it's common decency

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:39.961
And for the love of god and anything sacred

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:43.994
stop expecting a relationship to work if it's only one sided
