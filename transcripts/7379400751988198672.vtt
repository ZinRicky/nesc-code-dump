00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.000
so the math is mathing with this question

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.960
I'm 32 I have three children

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:05.240
they are 12 9 and 5

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:08.040
which means I had my first baby when I was 20

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.780
and it wasn't exactly part of the life plan

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.450
it was a happy accident

00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:14.460
 it was an unplanned miracle

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.800
not gonna go so far as to say it was immaculate concession

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:20.020
because that would be a lie

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.320
but did you know that birth control is only like 98

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:25.840
99% effective there is a very

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:30.560
very small chance that it doesn't work every time and

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.240
I can attest to that

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:33.640
so the story goes

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:38.040
I was 19 in my first year of university and I went to my uncle's wedding

00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:44.080
and at my uncle's wedding was a wedding singer and I thought he was cute

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:48.280
he thought I was cute we started hanging out and really

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:53.600
really liked each other and after a pretty short period of time

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:57.320
I was getting sick I was waking up sick

00:00:57.321 --> 00:00:59.440
I was throwing up in the mornings and I was like

00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:03.780
oh no I just have a tummy bag and his mum was like hmm

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.360
sounds like she's pregnant

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:07.040
maybe she should take a test and I was like

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:09.880
I'm so not pregnant there is absolutely no way that I'm pregnant

00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:11.120
I'm so not pregnant

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:14.360
I'm gonna prove to everyone how not pregnant I am by taking a test

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:16.240
so went to the university nurse

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:20.360
and I took a pregnancy test and I found out that I was pregnant

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:21.920
and I was so surprised

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:25.160
which now with my like actually fully developed frontal lobe

00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:29.720
I'm like you fkn idiot it was so obvious but anyway

00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:31.440
so I actually got pregnant when I was 19

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:35.520
but I didn't find out till I had just turned 20 and that was when I got sick

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.200
and we were just madly in love

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:37.840
loved each other

00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:44.340
loved the baby decided to go ahead with it and even get married so 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.040
I think back at this and I'm like

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:49.000
you were so naive and so young and just

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.000
just full of hope and optimism for life

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:54.400
and love and the world and all of the things

00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:56.260
but anyway that's what we did

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.040
and we got married and we had our baby and we were super happy

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:03.960
and two years later we had another baby so meanwhile

00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:07.680
I like I said was at university so I had done my first year

00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:09.680
I found out I was pregnant in my second year

00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:11.040
I finished my second year

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:14.960
and then I took the third year off and just stayed at home with the baby

00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:19.300
and then I took my third year and I split it up over two years

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.640
so by the end of the second year

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:25.600
I had a toddler and I was breastfeeding a Newborn at my graduation

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:29.480
which was pretty fkn epic now that I think about it now

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:32.040
but at the time I was just super embarrassed

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:33.600
because I was already

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:37.620
a couple of years older than the rest of the kids in my graduating class

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.040
and I was heavily pregnant

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:43.180
and occasionally I would have to take my toddler to class with me and it just

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.360
I got a lot of stares do you know what I mean

00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:47.120
but I was like whatever I'm here for a purpose

00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:49.040
I'm here to get my degree and I did

00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:51.680
I got the best grades and I worked really hard

00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:55.880
and I will just say that like nothing makes you work hard like being a mum

00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:56.520
you know what I mean

00:02:56.521 --> 00:03:00.840
like you can effectively use your time because you know how precious time is

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:02.280
whereas before when I was at uni

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:04.560
I was just sort of fkn around and finding out anyway

00:03:04.561 --> 00:03:06.660
so then I had two children

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.280
2 and under and it was a lot

00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:09.440
it was a lot I was like wow

00:03:09.441 --> 00:03:10.760
this is um so many kids

00:03:10.761 --> 00:03:11.200
and also

00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:15.380
we had no money because we were both students when we started our family

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.240
and so we were just trying to work and earn and pay the bills

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:21.960
and feed our children and clothe them

00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:23.340
and all of that sort of thing

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.480
and then after about three years was like I want another baby

00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:29.622
and then anyway so I went and made one 

00:03:29.623 --> 00:03:31.600
and that was when we got my daughter

00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:34.580
so there's a four year age gap between No. 2 and number three

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.160
and that was it for me like family done

00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:40.320
so I had finished having babies by the time I was 27

00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:42.240
and actually now that I'm in my 30s

00:03:42.241 --> 00:03:45.760
I struggle so much to think that my baby days are behind me

00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:47.840
because I am always so clucky

00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:49.240
I'm a very maternal person

00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:52.320
I absolutely love babies I love toddlers

00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:55.120
I love breastfeeding I love all of it

00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.780
and to think that like I'm still so young and that part of me is over

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.800
but then also the flipside of that is

00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:03.760
I get to really enjoy spending time with the children that I do have

00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:06.100
and they are absolutely my best friends

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.660
and because they're a bit older

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.440
they're really easy to do cool shit with

00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:12.880
like shit that you can't do with small children anyway

00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:14.280
I'm getting a bit off topic now

00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:18.500
so that is roughly the story of how I got pregnant

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.160
ha ha well

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:22.160
actually there's another story of how I got pregnant

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:25.760
but that is the story of how I became a mother at 20

00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:27.840
if you have any questions

00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:30.846
lay them on me because I don't really know what you wanna know
