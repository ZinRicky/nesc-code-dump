00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Two incredible things happened to me today

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:03.921
while I was early voting in Charleston County.

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:05.161
By the way, if you want early vote,

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:06.321
you can go to see Coast Church.

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:07.841
It's mega evangelical church,

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:09.641
which we can unpack that later.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:10.681
But the first thing is,

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:13.321
the man standing in front of me was an old veteran,

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:16.281
and the Republican candidate for treasurer came along the line

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.241
and started saying, hey,

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:18.601
does anybody have any questions?

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:21.521
This man grilled this candidate

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:24.041
about the fact that he joked a couple people up

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:26.041
about lowering taxes to zero.

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:27.281
Not only did he grill him,

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:29.601
he fucking torched this candidate.

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:33.521
And I have never seen male audacity used as a power for good,

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:35.081
and I fucking loved it. Secondly,

00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:36.441
on my way out from voting,

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:38.361
I saw a guy walking in, the wrong way,

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:39.441
I might add, uh,

00:00:39.442 --> 00:00:41.081
with a let's go, Brandon T-shirt.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.061
So I kindly let him know. I go, dude,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.800
they're not gonna let you in there with that shirt.

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:45.721
He's like, why not?

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:47.141
I said, cause it's political.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.440
He goes, I don't know what's political about it.

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:51.861
And I said, I guess we'll have to see what they think about that,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800
because, sir,

00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:55.281
come on. I'm not even sure you're aware

00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:57.541
that Joe Biden's not on the ballot this year.
