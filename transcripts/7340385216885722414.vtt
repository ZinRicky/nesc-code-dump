00:00.120 --> 00:01.960
All I've been craving is buffalo wings

00:01.960 --> 00:03.240
with homemade ranch.

00:03.240 --> 00:04.000
And yes, I've

00:04.000 --> 00:06.600
had this meal more than I should have in the past week,

00:06.600 --> 00:07.520
but here we are

00:07.520 --> 00:08.480
making it again.

00:08.480 --> 00:09.680
I know it's controversial,

00:09.680 --> 00:11.280
but you don't have to wash your chicken.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.360
It's a preference thing,

00:12.360 --> 00:14.420
so do whatever you want.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.640
Patted my wings dry and then added some cornstarch

00:17.640 --> 00:19.600
and whatever seasoning your heart desires.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.240
I do smoked paprika,

00:21.240 --> 00:22.000
garlic powder,

00:22.000 --> 00:23.360
Cajun seasoning,

00:23.360 --> 00:25.600
and then I let those hang out on my wire rack

00:25.600 --> 00:27.180
for at least 30 minutes.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.400
Meantime, I make my ranch with some Mayo,

00:29.400 --> 00:31.040
sour cream, buttermilk.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.520
You can also use regular milk,

00:32.520 --> 00:35.240
some dill. Can't forget the parsley and chives.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.240
Squeeze of lemon,

00:36.240 --> 00:38.980
and then I season it with some salt and pepper.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.600
Usually I bake my wings,

00:40.600 --> 00:42.400
but today my husband wanted them fried,

00:42.400 --> 00:43.400
so I did that.

00:43.400 --> 00:46.160
I fried them off in batches and did a double fry

00:46.160 --> 00:48.360
just to get them really nice and crispy.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.400
Once those were done,

00:49.400 --> 00:51.160
I melted some butter in my pot,

00:51.160 --> 00:53.640
added my favorite hot sauce, some honey,

00:53.640 --> 00:56.680
and let that simmer for a little bit just to thicken up.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.000
When it was time to coat the wings,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.760
I put them in a big metal bowl,

00:59.760 --> 01:00.960
poured my sauce over,

01:00.960 --> 01:02.720
but also reserved some on the side

01:02.720 --> 01:04.000
just to drizzle on top.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.700
Gave that really good toss.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.840
Put all of them on my big serving plate

01:07.840 --> 01:10.320
and I like to top them with either cilantro

01:10.320 --> 01:11.760
Parsley or spring onion?

01:11.760 --> 01:13.460
Today we did spring onion.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.500
Can't forget about the ranch I made.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.840
And the ratio of wing to ranch is very important.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.120
But these were so good

01:20.120 --> 01:22.500
that I'll probably be making them again tomorrow.
