00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.360
17 dirty diapers strewn around a house?

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:08.301
Absofuckinglutely. People should be embarrassed about that.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.000
The people who were tasked with supporting that mother

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.841
in the first few weeks of birthing that baby.

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:19.401
Why is she the one going around the house

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:21.301
to pick up all these fucking diapers?

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.720
Why were the fucking diapers left there?

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.821
She didn't have that baby by herself.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.400
She didn't. She's not the only one related to.

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:30.681
There's this baby. This baby didn't, like,

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:32.341
hatch from a fucking egg.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.040
There should have been other people around her

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:37.161
helping so that there weren't 17 diapers,

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.321
because we're. We're forgetting the fact that

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.781
not only did she change the fucking diaper,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.280
now she's the one that's cleaning up after.

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:45.321
She's doing the whole fucking thing.

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:47.681
So who are you to give her shit about when she picked him up?

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:49.661
What the fuck does it matter to you?

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.840
What does it matter to you?

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:54.841
And do you know how many times a Newborn baby shits in one day?

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:58.361
17 diapers can be collected pretty quickly

00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:00.761
depending on what's going on with the baby and with the mother

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:01.861
and with all that.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.520
But the people who should be embarrassed and ashamed and,

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:07.841
you know,

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:11.601
rethinking their fucking life and decisions for the 17 diapers

00:01:11.602 --> 00:01:13.601
is most certainly not that mother,

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:16.441
but every single fucking person around her

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:19.081
that was so excited that she was gonna have a baby.

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:22.761
All the people that showed up to her baby shower and sent Her congrats.

00:01:22.762 --> 00:01:26.781
All those people should be fucking mortified.
