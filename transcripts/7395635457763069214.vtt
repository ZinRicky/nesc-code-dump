00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.360
Cookie dough ice cream was always my first choice when I was younger,

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:05.841
but since I'm not able to find one with healthy ingredients,

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:08.681
I like to make my own. I find that many people are shocked

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:10.801
when they find out what it takes to make ice cream.

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:13.081
This ice cream maker attachment is a must.

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:16.721
I pour my raw, uncooked ingredients into a frozen bowl as it turns

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:18.841
and within 20 minutes I have thick

00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:21.481
yet soft vanilla ice cream with an orange hue.

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:23.201
Thanks to my pasture raised chickens,

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:24.841
I let that firm up in the freezer

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:27.641
and then freshly mill my regeneratively grown flour.

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:29.241
I want my kids to know what a true

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:31.321
cookie dough ice cream experience tastes like,

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.721
so this is an important part.

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:34.801
Combine my wet ingredients melted butter,

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:35.561
egg, vanilla,

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:38.801
and four tablespoons of coconut sugar with my dry ingredients

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:40.321
whole grain flour, baking soda,

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:41.801
and unrefined salt. Lastly,

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.281
I massage coarsely chopped

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:45.841
good ingredient chocolate chunks into my cookie dough,

00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:47.041
making little cookie balls

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.521
that I organize on a Parchment lined baking sheet.

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:51.641
This is put in the freezer for a short while

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:54.241
and then I store them in a jar until they are ready to be.

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:55.321
This is homemade ice cream,

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:58.001
so it requires some extra time to soften up on the counter

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.961
before scooping. There's no gums or stabilizers.

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:02.561
One or two scoops per bowl

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.321
topped with fresh cookie dough brings me back to my childhood

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:08.201
and it makes me So happy that my kids have a healthy treat

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:10.821
that they can themselves make for the rest of their lives.
