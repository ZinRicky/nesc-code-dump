There is nothing like a breakfast sausage,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.920
but when you choose to avoid pork, your options are limited.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.280
That's why I decided to make my own breakfast sausages

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.280
using 100% grass fed beef.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.760
The reason I don't like to eat pork

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.240
is because it's an animal that carries a bunch of toxins,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.520
parasites, and viruses.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.560
Not to mention they're raised in factory farms

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.320
where they live to bringly unhealthy lives

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.000
without ever having access to daylight or pasture.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.560
Nutrient dense beef sausages are really easy to make

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.040
and you can make a pretty large batch for additional meals

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.866
all week long.
