00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.240
So I started pmsing today,

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:03.441
and I don't know if this is like,

00:00:03.442 --> 00:00:05.941
a universal experience. I feel like it is, though.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.920
Um, I've turned into just a feral cat that lives under a porch

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:14.081
that is potentially ready to just murder people.

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:16.241
And I need someone to explain this. Honestly.

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:17.921
It might be Doctor Jolene Brighton.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:20.161
She's a mutual of mine on here on TikTok,

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:22.121
and she's a genius. But, like,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:26.561
I remember making fun of the idea of PMS when I was pre kids,

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:27.781
like, early 20s,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.840
and now all of a sudden, I have three kids,

00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:30.981
I'm in my, like,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.760
I guess we were. We're calling it late 30s now.

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:36.201
I'm 36, turning 37, um,

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:41.181
and my PMS comes on like a absolutely psychotic episode.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.120
Like Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde,

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:47.961
I am full of rage and sass and attitude and ready to, like,

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:52.601
watch Westeros burn. And I would either like to know if this is like

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:55.041
everybody and this is just how things go

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:57.841
and I need to go to some sort of commune for a couple days,

00:00:57.842 --> 00:00:59.275
or do I need to get my hormones checked
