00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.800
Did feminists ever stop to consider that some of us did not wanna leave the kitchen?

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:07.041
like I would make all the sandwiches and grab all the beers

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:08.661
if it meant I could stay home

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.800
Iâ€™d be content with that

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:13.921
I don't want a man in my kitchen spraying the Pam all over the counters

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:15.761
or seasonings covering it

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:17.861
guys can't multitask and clean as they go

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.780
Iâ€™d just be more stressed about the state that they leave my kitchen in

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.220
stay out of my kitchen

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.220
and I will stay out of the workplace

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.520
I'd be okay with that

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:26.861
I don't want Equality

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.160
obviously I don't want someone to like

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:30.501
physically hurt me

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.100
but I don't wanna sit there and split all the bills

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.460
I wanna be someone's dainty princess,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.900
feminine princess

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.380
I want them to come home after hard day

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.160
they see me they kiss me

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:44.141
and all their stress just melts away

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.080
I have dinner ready on the table when he comes home and he says

00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:48.541
this smells delicious

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.420
it's the best meal I've ever had,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.740
enjoys every last bite,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.980
tells me how much he loves me

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200
that's what I want

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:57.901
I don't want Equality

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.860
you can have the workplace

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.100
leave it to the men

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.900
I'll stay in the kitchen
