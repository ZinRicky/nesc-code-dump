00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.560
Welcome

00:00:00.561 --> 00:00:03.401
to a whole day of my life as a social media director for Dean Butler,

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:04.961
best known as Almanzo slash

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:07.041
Almanzo Wilder from Little House on the Prairie.

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:07.561
This weekend,

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:11.481
my husband Jacob and I jumped in the car and headed to Mansfield,

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:14.561
Missouri, for a special festival they call Wilder Days.

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:17.321
One of the things I really love about doing these events is

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:20.121
I get to meet fans from all across the country

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:22.241
that are obsessed with Little House on the Prairie.

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:25.881
And in the process, I also get to make a lot of fun content for Dean.

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:28.281
This year's the fiftieth anniversary of Little House on the Prairie,

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:31.581
the TV series. And we've traveled to so many different homesteads,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.520
and it's been such a joy to see the way Laura Ingalls Wilder

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:36.561
really lived her life.

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:39.521
And the way people resonate with Laura and her story.

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:42.121
So special, and it feels so nostalgic.

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:42.561
This is me

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:46.361
trying to convince Dean that he should do a video with Gen Z slang.

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.001
And if you haven't seen it yet,

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:49.881
you should. And the bloopers are coming,

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:52.041
and they're wonderful. As we wrap up this event,

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:55.801
it's so exciting because Dean's gonna be in Tulsa this week,

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:59.301
so stay tuned for all the Tulsa content coming.
