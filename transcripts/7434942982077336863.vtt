00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
While I did vote for Kamala,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.800
I'm not gonna completely cut off people in my life

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.321
that did vote for Donald Trump.

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:07.881
I'm a woman, I'm a Latina,

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:10.661
I'm like, definitely a hardcore fucking advocate.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.480
I have a daughter that's disabled,

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:14.361
she's on an IEP. You know,

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:17.821
she's at a higher risk for many things

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.040
because I was once that super close minded

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:26.001
but good hearted person that did not understand, like, true,

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.861
I know it sounds like you've gotta be fucking stupid to not get it.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.320
I promise you, I was one of them, I,

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:36.841
I was, I was one of those women that would say like, yeah,

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.881
I think it'd be okay if maybe just,

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:41.641
you know, the husband cast the vote for the family

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:44.641
and then like, for as many people in your family,

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:45.081
like, maybe

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:48.561
that's as many votes as your husband gets to cast in the election.

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:48.961
So, like,

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:51.641
for us, because we're married with four kids,

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:54.201
we would have like, you would get six votes

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:56.361
and we just all would submit to what your vote is.

00:00:56.362 --> 00:01:01.201
Like, there are people that are that brainwashed

00:01:01.202 --> 00:01:05.221
that think in their heart that that would make a better world.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.040
Like, you'll see.

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:07.961
Like, I promise you,

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:11.881
once we get there, you'll understand and you'll thank me.

00:01:11.882 --> 00:01:13.881
Like, exactly the same way you feel,

00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:16.781
they feel the same way, but just mirror that shit.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.320
But also the same kind heart that you have that you want to see.

00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:22.161
Good. In the world,

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:26.261
they have that too. And so if you completely cut them off,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.360
two things happen. Number one,

00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:30.041
it just creates such a deeper divide,

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:31.381
which is not what we need

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.820
ever. You know what I mean?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.440
I think that's a very rash decision

00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:40.541
and it's a very emotionally filled decision.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.100
And I don't really think it gets anyone anywhere.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.960
I think the better thing to do,

00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:46.921
and this is what I do.

00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:49.481
And unfortunately sometimes the relationships will still end.

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:51.901
No, we're still gonna be in relationship.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.800
I'm just. I'm not going to filter it.

00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:59.001
I'm not gonna put the rose colored tint on my stories

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:03.441
to make you feel better. I'm gonna talk about my life and my struggles

00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:07.121
and the things that I go through earnestly and honestly with you,

00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:08.141
my friend.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.680
And if I can weave in how certain politics maybe have affected that,

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:16.261
I'm going to. And I'm gonna let you sit with that,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.800
because that's the only way change happens.

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:19.161
Like I don't.

00:02:19.162 --> 00:02:23.141
There was a vice documentary about this black dude that has converted

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.080
like 400 KKK members or something.

00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:29.421
He's even gotten like a grand marshal or some shit.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.680
It's a fucking really wild story.

00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:33.561
It's available on YouTube and you can Google it

00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:34.921
cause it's a very fucking famous story.

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:36.801
I'm pretty sure the dude is still alive and well

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:39.141
and living in the south and still on his mission.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.640
He goes into their spaces and helps teach Them.

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:45.421
I just think there's different people

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.560
with different abilities in this world.

00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:50.201
That's what makes it a beautiful place.

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:51.881
We all have different dynamics,

00:02:51.882 --> 00:02:53.681
we all see the world through different lenses.

00:02:53.682 --> 00:02:56.761
And we can only speak to the people that we speak to.

00:02:56.762 --> 00:02:59.181
And so for me personally, I'm not like,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.200
fuck you, get out of my life.

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:02.681
Block, block,

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.041
block, block,

00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:05.281
block it now I'm illuminated.

00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:09.341
I did go and see which people of mine follow him on

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.920
you on fucking Instagram or whatever.

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:16.341
But you know, for me personally,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.760
that's my decision.

00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:20.401
And I just wanted to share it for other people to consider.

00:03:20.402 --> 00:03:23.861
Because if it weren't for my friends that stayed in my life

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.260
and helped me see the injustices.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.760
Because that kind heart is gonna speak to that kind heart,

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:32.601
you know what I mean? Everything else is details.

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:36.001
The kindness is the same, the heart is the same.

00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:37.921
And if those people would have deserted me,

00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:39.801
it would have only driven me deeper.

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:43.181
Cause I would have had nowhere else to go. So.
