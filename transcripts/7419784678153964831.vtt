00:00.040 --> 00:00.640
Okay.

00:00.641 --> 00:03.881
One of the things that I struggle with while I'm solo parenting is,

00:03.882 --> 00:05.081
like, getting out of the house,

00:05.082 --> 00:07.181
getting dressed up, and going somewhere for fun.

00:07.480 --> 00:08.720
Like, we go to the park and stuff,

00:08.721 --> 00:09.161
but, like,

00:09.162 --> 00:11.821
and run our errands, but other than that,

00:11.840 --> 00:12.760
we don't go. I mean,

00:12.761 --> 00:13.801
we don't have family or anything,

00:13.802 --> 00:15.261
so it's not like we can, like,

00:15.360 --> 00:16.800
go anywhere. Um,

00:16.801 --> 00:18.121
we don't have family here,

00:18.122 --> 00:20.241
so that's the hardest thing,

00:20.242 --> 00:20.921
because then it, like,

00:20.922 --> 00:22.861
you feel lonely. You're just, like,

00:22.960 --> 00:26.680
every day feels the same. The days go by slower today.

00:26.681 --> 00:28.601
Especially weekends. Weekends are like,

00:28.602 --> 00:29.921
I need to get out of the house and, like,

00:29.922 --> 00:31.701
do something. Um,

00:31.800 --> 00:34.200
so today I'm like, you know what?

00:34.201 --> 00:36.781
We're gonna get dressed, we're gonna, like,

00:36.920 --> 00:38.800
do our makeup a little bit,

00:38.801 --> 00:41.781
wear something cute, and we're gonna go to the mall.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.700
You see that?

00:58.360 --> 00:59.700
Tiene que salir normal.
