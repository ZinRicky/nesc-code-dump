00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
My mom was in and out of the mental hospital

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.121
and on pharmaceuticals my entire childhood.

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:05.121
Before she ended her life.

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:06.521
We were on government assistance

00:00:06.522 --> 00:00:08.761
and shopped at goodwill when we had enough money.

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:12.201
Childhood traumas had LED to behavioral patterns and lifestyle choices

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:14.421
that were actively working against my physical

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.120
and mental health.

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:17.921
I got to a point where my body could no longer handle the toxic burden.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:20.961
I was forced to flip a 1 80 with my entire diet and lifestyle

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.361
to escape the fate the system had designed for us.

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:24.801
I have all my medications.

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:25.921
Stop going to the doctor.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.721
Unplug from the news and conditioning.

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:28.921
Dove down the rabbit hole.

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:30.961
Focused heavily on nutrient dense foods

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:32.760
and their most bioavailable forms

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.281
while avoiding as many environmental toxins as I could.

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:36.481
Healed my menstrual cycle

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:39.441
and gained back more energy than I've ever had in my life.

00:00:39.442 --> 00:00:40.041
And with that,

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:43.041
I was able to build a business where I get to work whenever I want,

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.361
make as much as I want,

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:47.301
and attract the most incredible people and opportunities.
