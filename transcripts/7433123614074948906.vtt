00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
A Sunday morning in my life as a young Christian wife.

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:05.401
Jacob and I don't have children yet,

00:00:05.402 --> 00:00:08.921
so Sunday mornings are usually pretty low key and very chill.

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:11.081
And this morning was one of those days.

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:14.441
Except for a little mess that happened that you'll see in just a bit.

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:16.621
Here's Jacob telling me, NFL drama,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.380
but he's like, does he work for the NFL?

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.780
He works for, uh,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.540
ESPN.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.960
Yikes. My husband is not a big sports guy.

00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:33.121
It's been really fun to learn how football works

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:34.601
together with his fantasy team,

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:37.041
and I appreciate hearing all the little updates.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:40.301
And then this is where everything changed in my morning.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.680
I spilled my matcha all over my coffee table,

00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:46.241
and Jacob was so quick to come to my rescue.

00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:49.201
We started putting up all of our Christmas decor last night,

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:52.961
and we did not finish, so I do feel a little behind in that.

00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:54.041
But that's okay. We can.

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:55.081
We can get it done tonight.

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:56.161
It's not that big of a deal.

00:00:56.162 --> 00:00:56.881
On Sunday mornings,

00:00:56.882 --> 00:00:59.681
I like my makeup and skincare to be very quick and easy,

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:03.601
and my tallow based skincare is the perfect base for.

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:06.561
For this. And it's buildable so I can put makeup on top of it.

00:01:06.562 --> 00:01:09.241
And my skin looks so smooth and soft,

00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:11.321
and I've really feel it throughout the day.

00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:12.761
Love fierce nature.

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:13.841
Shout out to them. This morning

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:15.201
we're visiting my sister's church

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:17.081
because she's starting a new small group.

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:20.201
At her church, and I'm very excited to go and support her in that.

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:23.521
It's crazy how our lives have changed so much in just four short years.

00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:26.241
But the Lord is so faithful and has done so many good things,

00:01:26.242 --> 00:01:29.221
and I know he will continue to do so. Have a great Sunday.
