The other day me and my husband were talking about caramel apples

00:03.681 --> 00:05.901
when our kids overheard our conversations.

00:05.960 --> 00:09.440
They were begging me to try one since they've never had one before,

00:09.441 --> 00:11.801
so I just decided to make them some today.

00:11.802 --> 00:15.121
Started off by putting some skewers into Granny Smith apples

00:15.122 --> 00:17.001
and blanching them in some hot water

00:17.002 --> 00:19.361
for all the wax coating to come off.

00:19.362 --> 00:22.961
After about 20 seconds I rub them down with a paper towel

00:22.962 --> 00:25.081
just to make sure they were extra clean.

00:25.082 --> 00:29.001
I pop those in my fridge to cool while I got started on my caramel.

00:29.002 --> 00:31.761
We kept it really simple today with some brown sugar,

00:31.762 --> 00:33.801
heavy cream, and some butter.

00:33.802 --> 00:36.521
Melted all of that down while stirring it frequently,

00:36.522 --> 00:39.281
and once it was melted, I pulled it off the stove,

00:39.282 --> 00:42.581
added some vanilla and let it cool so it would thicken.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.580
I was happy with the consistency.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.640
I started dipping my cold apples into the caramel

00:47.641 --> 00:51.401
and I made sure to repeat that process at least two or three times

00:51.402 --> 00:53.401
to get a nice even coating on them.

00:53.402 --> 00:56.921
I then put them in the fridge for about 30 minutes to set

00:56.922 --> 00:58.681
and then it was time to slice them.

00:58.682 --> 01:02.254
The kids were so excited and kept asking for more after the first.
