00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.960
will say like oh

00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:02.840
it's cause they don't like you enough

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:05.320
and I just never felt like that was like

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:08.000
I fucking hate when people say oh

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:09.040
he just didn't like you

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.860
like that he just didn't like you enough

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.480
um you're gonna have to

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:14.200
or when people say this about themselves

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:15.280
about their own relationships

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:15.800
they're like oh

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:20.080
I'm gonna have to watch the next girl get treated the way that she deserves

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:21.720
the way that I deserved to be treated

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.720
just because he's gonna actually love her

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.220
and she's gonna

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.240
pull out all the traits and characteristics in him that I just couldn't

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:30.040
because I was just an inferior woman

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:30.760
like bitch

00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:34.960
oh my god obviously people aren't publicly saying out loud like

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:38.320
I'm just an inferior woman and that's why he treated me the way that he did

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:39.800
but that's like the underpinning right

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:40.960
that's the quiet part

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:42.720
cuz let me say something controversial here

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:46.120
I was treated so horribly

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:50.320
I was treated the worst by the one man that I've been with

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:54.120
who I think actually had really deep and true feelings for me

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.920
I think that those two things are like

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:59.240
not related I think that they're not correlated at all

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.380
I think that men

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.840
because of patriarchy

00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:03.560
this is how men suffer under patriarchy

00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:05.560
I think that they're willing to shoot themselves in the foot

00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:08.220
and they're willing to sabotage their own happiness

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.360
just to not lose their sense of control and power

00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:17.000
I think that a man can have really true deep feelings for a woman

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:21.560
like I think that a man can love a woman and still treat her like absolute shit

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:24.400
like I think that's what happened to me personally

00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:25.760
might be controversial to say

00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:28.200
but that's my lived experience personally

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:33.720
but also regardless of whether or not he had deep feelings for you

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:37.520
it's possible to not have really deep feelings for someone

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:39.100
and still not treat them like shit

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.000
the reason why men treat women like shit is because of patriarchy

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.860
hello it's because of

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.680
like the ways in which our system is set up to allow men to get away with shit

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.320
okay I'm just rambling now at this point cause I'm a little tipsy

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.720
but listen I've been watching Bridgerton

00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:55.600
like we all have been

00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:57.140
I watched Bridgerton today

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.960
and watching Bridgerton

00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:00.560
I think about the fact that like

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.700
when a man did something dishonorable once upon a time

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.420
if a man treated a woman in a dishonorable way

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.800
um meet me at dawn motherfucker

00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:09.480
pistols drawn

00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.120
like we're gonna duel over this

00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:13.280
nowadays it's not like that anymore

00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:17.080
men just do whatever the fuck they wanna do and their homies don't check them

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:20.160
and obviously women don't have the power to check them anyway

00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:22.620
stop taking the way a man treats you personally

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.060
men do not act rationally

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.200
the way that they feel about you

00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:31.120
the way they feel about a situation and um

00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:32.760
you and who you are

00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:34.940
and your character and your value and your worth

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.078
not correlated at all to the way a man treats you
