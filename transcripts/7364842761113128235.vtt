00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.474
Do you know that most men 

00:00:01.475 --> 00:00:04.601
don't actually expect you to cook three meals a day for them

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:06.461
Clean the whole house top to bottom 

00:00:06.462 --> 00:00:07.961
and cater to their every need

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:10.881
it's a little unrealistic to do all of these things

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:14.881
especially if you have to work a full time job and take care of the children

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:19.641
just like it's a little unrealistic to expect every man make over six figures

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:20.721
When men live alone

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:23.641
they eat prepped food or order take out

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:27.021
Do they really don't need to cook and clean for them all the time

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.740
IF and only if you like to THEN, it'll be appreciated

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.760
Theyâ€™ll love you for it

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.015
but it's not necessary to keep a man 

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:36.721
Men are such simple creatures

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:38.241
If you don't care to do the housekeeping

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:38.903
then don't 

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:42.761
there's tons of men out there that do most of the house keeping

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:46.361
Men I know personally that do a majority of the household chores

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.361
that's just what works for their relationship

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:50.201
so it's not just a woman thing

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:51.861
Men will love you the same

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.520
but they appreciate you whenever you do these things

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.961
clean for them, cook for them

00:00:57.962 --> 00:00:59.081
take care of them

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:03.241
I've openly expressed my opinions on cleaning and cooking for a man

00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:04.721
y'all know where I stand on this

00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:08.061
I just do it because I like to take care of my man

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.930
but I'm not saying you have to
