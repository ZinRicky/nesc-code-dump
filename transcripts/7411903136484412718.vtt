00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.940
So how do we fix this problem with our boys?

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.880
How do we fix it? What do we do?

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:06.281
How do we keep this from happening?

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:09.161
Because this has become a just widespread,

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:12.221
systemic issue with our boys and guns and schools.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.920
So, um,

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.641
I think there's two ways of fixing it.

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:17.101
Again, I'm not a professional.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm just a mom with two boys

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.141
and who's done a lot of research about parenting.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.400
Okay, uh,

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:25.661
but I'm a layman, I'm not an expert.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.800
These are my opinions. First,

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:29.461
at an individual family level,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.960
you have to raise your voice the same way you would raise a daughter.

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:34.161
And I don't mean with, like,

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:36.281
dresses and makeup. Although if he's into that.

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:38.121
Go fucking on, Bud.

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:40.321
Have a great time. However,

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:43.601
what I mean is being able to identify emotions

00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:47.821
and the entire wide range of emotions, um,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.420
accept those emotions as innately human,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.020
and then have healthy coping mechanisms

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.420
for when those emotions get to be overwhelming.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.080
Now, you can start this as a toddler.

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:01.561
I have a two and a half year old right now

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:04.921
who's having a really hard time controlling his hands when he's angry.

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:06.801
I'm sure a lot of people with two and a half year old

00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:09.001
or three year old boys can understand.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.021
He's hitting me, he's hitting his siblings,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.120
he's throwing things. And all of this is developmentally appropriate.

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:19.521
Right, but what we don't want this to do is continue on.

00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:22.041
We do not Want to accept this as just always,

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:24.801
just boys being boys. He's just rough,

00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:26.281
you know? It's okay.

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:27.501
It's not okay.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.440
So I have had for years because I have two older children.

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.901
I have books on what to do with big feelings.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.620
We have sensory toys, balls you can squeeze when you're angry.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.360
We have had multiple talks.

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:42.921
When he goes through a tantrum and he hits me,

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:46.161
I do not hit him back. I do not meet violence with violence.

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:49.681
We don't use violence as a tool of coercion or control in this house.

00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:53.261
Because why would I teach my children to use violence as a tool?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.460
No idea. Um.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.840
We have coping skills. We have calm corners.

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:05.621
We have discussions. We have discussions because it takes repetition.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.760
It is a practice. It is really hard

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.241
and almost impossible for a toddler at that developmental age

00:02:12.242 --> 00:02:13.801
to control their field, their.

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:15.841
Their body in that moment.

00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:20.401
However, repetition of a lesson will stay with them,

00:02:20.402 --> 00:02:22.081
and they will eventually learn.

00:02:22.082 --> 00:02:24.241
And he's already starting to get it.

00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:27.101
He apologizes after he is violent,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.520
I walk away. If he's violent once with me,

00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:32.201
I put him down. I walk away.

00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:33.961
I said, you are not gonna hurt Mama.

00:02:33.962 --> 00:02:36.041
Mmm. You're not allowed to hurt anyone,

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:37.841
and I'm not gonna let you hurt me,

00:02:37.842 --> 00:02:39.181
so I'm gonna go.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.880
My two and a half year old can now tell me the difference between

00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:43.261
when he's feeling frustrated,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.640
when he's feeling sad. And when he's feeling angry,

00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:47.541
I know grown men who can't do that.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.360
Now, systemically,

00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:52.021
we have a problem with our idea of masculinity

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.880
because it fits in such a tight,

00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:58.341
narrow box that almost no man can actually fit it,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.780
because it's inhuman.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.000
Our idea of masculinity is inhumane because it cuts people off,

00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:11.321
male people, from the wide range of human emotions

00:03:11.322 --> 00:03:13.161
and their ability to express them.

00:03:13.162 --> 00:03:17.181
How many times have we seen people disparage men who cry?

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.420
Just look at Tim Walters speech.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.000
Look how many people were talking about what a sissy his son is

00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:24.641
for being overcome with emotion.

00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:26.081
That is the world we live in,

00:03:26.082 --> 00:03:30.781
where a boy crying with pride for his father

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.060
is considered a sign of weakness,

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.100
considered a sign of being emasculated.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.080
If you don't express your emotions,

00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:41.601
they will express themselves through you.

00:03:41.602 --> 00:03:44.441
And we see this through the male mental health crisis

00:03:44.442 --> 00:03:45.561
that we have in this country

00:03:45.562 --> 00:03:49.761
because we have massive rates of men unaliving themselves.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:53.641
And that is toxic emotion faced inwards.

00:03:53.642 --> 00:03:57.781
And then we also have an epidemic of violence against women,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.760
against children and in schools by young angry men.

00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:05.921
Because the only emotion they know how to express is anger.

00:04:05.922 --> 00:04:09.281
And they are either gonna bring it in or they're gonna push it out.

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.121
And if they push it out too far,

00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:14.221
they're gonna take everyone with them.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.540
We have to allow our boys to be humans.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.100
And we have to allow Our men to be humans.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.660
And we have to stop acting like being human is innately feminine,

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.000
wild, uh,

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:29.981
that being human is innately emasculating,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.660
that being human is innately weak.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.880
Those are the messages that boys get when they go into this world.

00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:38.241
When they are told that they can be rageful,

00:04:38.242 --> 00:04:39.721
be angry, be tough.

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:40.921
But, my god,

00:04:40.922 --> 00:04:43.461
don't be sad, don't be weak.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.400
Don't need your parents, don't need help.

00:04:46.401 --> 00:04:48.841
My god, you're supposed to be the man of the house.

00:04:48.842 --> 00:04:51.381
That's insane. That's insane.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.380
We are trying to train boys to be robots,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.660
and instead, what we're getting is killers.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.660
Confidence comes from knowing who you are

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.880
and having control over who you are

00:05:01.881 --> 00:05:03.561
and how you express yourself

00:05:03.562 --> 00:05:06.461
and the way you carry yourself in this world.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.900
And insecurity is where violence and rage and anger and entitlement.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.260
All of that comes from

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.860
either feeling things you're not supposed to feel,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.940
um, or having no outlet for the feelings that you can recognize.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.300
We need to do better at both.
