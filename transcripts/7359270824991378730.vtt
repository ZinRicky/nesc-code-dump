Do any of you millennials remember the website Millsbury?

00:03.681 --> 00:05.401
I haven't thought about it in years,

00:05.402 --> 00:08.281
but I was in the grocery store the other day and all came back to me.

00:08.282 --> 00:11.061
So if you were born in the nineties,

00:11.400 --> 00:13.680
you probably played this as a middle schooler.

00:13.681 --> 00:14.881
It was such a fun website.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.041
It was so wholesome.

00:16.042 --> 00:18.601
You would create your own little character

00:18.602 --> 00:20.881
and then you would buy it like a house

00:20.882 --> 00:22.921
and you could put clothes on them.

00:22.922 --> 00:25.121
You could go buy clothes for them.

00:25.122 --> 00:26.361
You would go to the grocery store,

00:26.362 --> 00:27.161
get them their food,

00:27.162 --> 00:30.601
and the foods were like all General Mills foods.

00:30.602 --> 00:33.001
And so you kind of felt cool cause you knew the different foods.

00:33.002 --> 00:34.761
Like when you go to the grocery store with your mom.

00:34.762 --> 00:36.701
It was so much fun.

00:36.720 --> 00:40.640
I spent so much time playing the baseball game on here

00:40.641 --> 00:41.961
and the rope climbing game,

00:41.962 --> 00:43.681
winning all these prizes and. Oh yeah,

00:43.682 --> 00:46.481
you would do like, yard sales where you could sell your stuff to, like,

00:46.482 --> 00:48.521
other people. And so I'm pretty sure you could have like,

00:48.522 --> 00:52.061
a username and you could be friends with people you knew in real life.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.320
I don't know. I need to go do some research.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.161
But it was so much fun

00:56.162 --> 00:58.601
and I kind of wish that they would bring it back.

00:58.602 --> 01:00.101
It. Did anybody else play this?

01:00.720 --> 01:03.740
I felt like it was huge at the time and then it just kind of went away.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.180
But Anyway, lots of fun.

01:06.960 --> 01:07.900
Very nostalgic.
