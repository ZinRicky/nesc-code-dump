00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
I am excited to announce the establishment of an m m

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:10.381
I W G2S healing and Empowerment Endowment Fund.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.880
The Manitoba government is investing $15 million

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.501
into the creation of an endowment fund

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.260
in partnership with the Winnipeg Foundation.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.160
Our investment of $15 million will help support directly m m

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.181
I W G2S families.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.420
This endowment fund will help support families

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.060
access healing and ceremony.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.580
This endowment fund will also help support organizations

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.240
that are indigenous LED

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.001
and that are working on the front lines and working with m m

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:46.501
I W G families.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.560
This endowment fund will accept donations from citizens directly

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.981
from Manitobans across Canada

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.420
that folks that want to invest will be able to make a donation.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.100
We would like to see the endowment fund reach $50 million.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.720
We will be ensuring that

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:08.861
we are seeking donations from corporate entities,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.180
businesses,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.820
the like, anybody that says that they believe in reconciliation,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.580
that they're on the path of reconciliation,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.140
action that, action that and invest in the endowment fund.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.060
None of this would have been possible without the work of the families

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.480
and the courageousness of them.

00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:31.681
And I remember when I first,

00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:34.181
my sister first went missing and,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.500
you know, how hard, um,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.900
it was seeing family struggle,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.000
watching families sit by the phone

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.081
waiting for a phone call or for that,

00:01:44.082 --> 00:01:48.861
you know, that police officer to come and knock at that door

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.160
or like Minister Fontaine said,

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:52.581
excessively searching.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.120
Like there's so many other things that families are Doing that,

00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:57.721
they need so much more support.

00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:01.001
So this endowment fund is gonna help support those families.

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.641
My story is very much the same as,

00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:07.001
as many indigenous people across this country.

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:08.481
I think about my sister

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:14.481
and the injustice that was brought upon her during her life

00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:22.001
and even after her death. I think about my sister's death 23 years ago

00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:22.681
and how

00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:30.261
this endowment fund would have helped to bring her body back home.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.560
I am very happy to hear that there is this fund

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:38.781
that will help pave the way for that support

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.500
and for the ongoing initiatives that are transpiring across Canada.
