00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
I got this 24 pack of modeling clay for my kids.

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:04.881
It has a bunch of little colors,

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:07.001
and I'm gonna be honest, at first,

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:12.441
I was a little skeptical. It did sit outside in the Florida sun for,

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:14.981
like, almost 24 hours,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.600
and it was in a hot car, so I was kind of afraid that with the bubbles,

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.361
this was going to be messed up.

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:23.421
Oh, look,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.440
Mommy's already using it to make a banana,

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:26.841
which is his favorite fruit.

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:29.781
But it is really good quality.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.960
It feels kind of foamy,

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:36.341
so it's not quite like the hard clay that I have seen,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.200
but it's much easier to work with,

00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:41.801
according to Madison. It's much easier to work with,

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.801
and they are very excited.

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:46.701
There are 24 different colors.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.820
Got a bunch of them right here.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.220
Blueberry and a blueberry.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.520
Look at that. So

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:59.081
if your kids are really creative and love to make things out of clay,

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:01.547
I highly recommend you get this on the TikTok shop.
