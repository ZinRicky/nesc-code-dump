00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
I don't always have time for a luxurious bath time,

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:03.441
but whenever I get the chance,

00:00:03.442 --> 00:00:06.761
I'm always reaching for my Old Whaling Company products.

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:08.321
This is a local Charleston based company,

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:10.601
and they have the most delicious smelling

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:13.641
coastal inspired scents for all of their products, bathrooms,

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:14.821
soaps, and lotions.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.680
I just got an order in of their Floral Coast scent,

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:19.441
which is like hydrangeas at the beach.

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:20.441
And the best part for y'all

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:22.081
is that they just opened up their TikTok shop

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:23.341
so you can get this bundle,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.900
this three pack of goodies,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.600
sent to your house,

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:27.041
and you don't have to come all the way to Charleston.

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:28.401
They have tons of different scents,

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.041
so if Floral Coast isn't your jam,

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:31.241
you can go try something else.

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:32.481
However, this is my favorite.

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:34.961
So I'm gonna go ahead and link this bundle down here

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:37.321
for their TikTok shop so you can try all three products.

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:41.538
And especially, don't forget the body butter. Your skin will thank me.
