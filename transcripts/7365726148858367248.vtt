How to dress for the Female Gaze.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.640
The female gaze is all about comfort and creativity over flattery.

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.401
So let's start with a maxi skirt.

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:10.441
It can be any color, fabric or print that you like.

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:12.201
Time to add a layer on top.

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:14.161
Choose your comfiest, chunkiest,

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:16.161
oversized knit. For shoes,

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:19.541
let's make a statement with either a bold color or a chunky silhouette.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.860
Let's accessorize. The more bling the better.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.000
Then we'll add some interest

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.281
with a hat that doesn't match the vibe of the skirt

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:28.401
and some sort of Bandana or scarf.

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:32.521
Finally, let's add a bag that matches the vibe or color of our shoes.

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:35.601
And now that your outfit is focused on interest rather than flattery,

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.421
you're dressed for the female gaze.
