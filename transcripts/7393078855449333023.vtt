I always hear people say that you shouldn't homeschool your kids

00:02.441 --> 00:05.121
because they might not turn out normal.

00:05.122 --> 00:06.561
They might turn out weird.

00:06.562 --> 00:10.881
As if fitting in with the world is the number one priority of parents.

00:10.882 --> 00:13.641
Have you stopped to look around at this world

00:13.642 --> 00:15.841
and at what is normal in this world?

00:15.842 --> 00:18.601
Normal is being anxious. Normal is being depressed.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.001
Normal is being unhealthy.

00:20.002 --> 00:21.361
Normal is being divorced.

00:21.362 --> 00:23.641
Normal is working at a dead end job that you hate.

00:23.642 --> 00:26.401
That is normal. The average age for a child

00:26.402 --> 00:30.001
to first view explicit images and videos online

00:30.002 --> 00:32.561
is 11. That's normal.

00:32.562 --> 00:37.161
So heaven forbid any parent want to deviate from that norm.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.921
Heaven forbid anybody look at that and go,

00:38.922 --> 00:41.881
you know what? I don't want that for my kid.

00:41.882 --> 00:43.481
And of course, even homeschoolers,

00:43.482 --> 00:45.401
anybody can experience those things.

00:45.402 --> 00:49.241
But to pretend like normal is such an amazing thing,

00:49.242 --> 00:51.121
and it's like this high bar that we've set,

00:51.122 --> 00:55.321
it's just a lie. I think so many parents are recognizing this

00:55.322 --> 00:58.841
and realizing that there are far worse things in the world

00:58.842 --> 01:01.301
than your child not being normal.
