00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
You wanna know where people go wrong in relationships

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:04.305
where they go wrong is 

00:00:04.306 --> 00:00:07.061
judging their partners everyday choices

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.680
Saying, oh that's not how you do that

00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:10.641
or oh why are we parking so far

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:12.721
or oh why did you turn into this lane

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:14.201
oh that's not how you do dishes

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:15.521
If you mindlessly do these things

00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:17.925
then you're causing friction in your relationship

00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:19.201
 without even realizing it

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:21.081
or they end up not liking you anymore

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:23.521
or they just become disdainful towards you

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:25.521
when you question somebody's actions

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:27.801
whatever it may be, in everyday life

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.681
then feel like they can't do anything right

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:31.481
they feel like they're always in the wrong

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:33.001
nobody wants to be in a relationship

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:35.121
where they feel like everything they do is wrong

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:37.321
if you do these things and you don't even realize it

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:38.921
try to catch yourself before you do it

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.841
You want to make your partner feel special

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:42.681
not like they can't do anything right

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:45.841
stop questioning their actions and trust their judgment

00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:46.701
At the end of the day

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.280
It doesn't matter how you do things

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.801
doesn't matter where you're parking

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:52.401
and it doesn't necessarily matter how they do the dishes

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:53.281
they're doing it

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:54.681
that should count right

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:57.401
Instead you should start appreciating that they're putting an effort

00:00:57.402 --> 00:00:58.881
or that they're doing these things for you

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:00.801
if you don't want a failed relationship

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:03.401
then start looking at things in a positive light

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:06.541
start appreciating them for doing the dishes to begin with

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.800
For doing whatever project to begin with

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:09.913
to be driving you 

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:11.891
give them a little bit of credit

00:01:11.892 --> 00:01:13.561
 if you want a long lasting

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:15.281
loving relationship

00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:16.261
huh Frank

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.320
I love you, say it

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:20.331
say it back, okay bye
