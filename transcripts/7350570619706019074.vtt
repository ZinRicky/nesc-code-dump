00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.800
tell me you have high functioning anxiety

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.961
and perfectionist procrastination without telling me

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:04.536
I'll go first 

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:07.001
cause painting my wardrobe wasn't on my bingo card for today

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.361
or any day for that matter

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.043
but I guess that's what happens when you 

00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:11.521
allow an adult with undiagnosed ADHD

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:12.690
Make her own life decisions 

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:13.401
but in my defence

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:15.111
it did feel very important at the time 

00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:15.674
so there’s that

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:18.041
as you can see my room was - for lack of a better word - fkd

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:20.281
 And please excuse the fact that there's no sheets on the bed

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:22.252
I'm currently washing them and in hindsight 

00:00:22.253 --> 00:00:23.641
that's probably what set me off

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:25.517
actually I think there's a few things that set me off 

00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:28.261
firstly I'm going away next month and I have no idea what to pack 

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:28.761
and secondly

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.881
the seasons are changing rapidly here in Aotearoa 

00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:32.612
New Zealand and it suddenly gone from 

00:00:32.613 --> 00:00:34.161
mild to colder than a witch's tit

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:36.011
so I needed to do a stock take of sorts 

00:00:36.012 --> 00:00:37.121
An inventory if you like

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:38.081
which is another way of saying

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:39.543
I needed to figure out what the hell I'm 

00:00:39.544 --> 00:00:40.721
actually keeping in this cupboard

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:43.841
and it turns out the cupboard itself was actually another contributing factor

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:46.201
and I'm gonna go ahead and assume that you remember my last house

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:48.241
and the beautiful walk-in robe that I used to have

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:51.121
now I have a cupboard that reminds me of when I was a student

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:53.361
and it also smells like when I was a student

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:55.406
which means all of my winter clothes smell 

00:00:55.407 --> 00:00:56.881
like absolute ass unfortunately

00:00:56.882 --> 00:00:58.241
but we're gonna deal with the clothes in a second

00:00:58.242 --> 00:01:00.261
cause right now I'm just wiping out the cupboard with bleach

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.640
and that was about the time that I noticed that not only was it mouldy

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.222
but also all of the wallpaper had these tiny holes in it 

00:01:05.223 --> 00:01:05.721
Side note

00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:07.361
but one day I'm gonna rip this whole cupboard out

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:09.081
and bust through this wall into the next room

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:10.201
and turn it into a walk in robe slash ensuite

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.161
 but that day is not today

00:01:12.162 --> 00:01:13.201
today we're just gonna make it

00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:14.261
I don't know not disgusting? 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.944
and then my husband walked in and saw the 

00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:16.921
enormous mess that I've made

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:18.601
and the fact that I was painting a cupboard

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:19.511
and he was surprised 

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:20.681
but not surprised surprised

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:21.561
do you know what I mean 

00:01:21.562 --> 00:01:22.001
and fun fact

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:23.641
well fun if you're anything like me

00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:25.321
but this paint actually has a mould killer in it

00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:27.821
so I'm telling myself it's gonna help me in the long run

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.240
so while I was organising my clothes

00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:31.321
I made a few piles. I made a pile of summer stuff

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:33.441
which I don't need to see until pie season is over

00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:34.881
and I've put them into another cupboard 

00:01:34.882 --> 00:01:37.661
I made a pile of winter clothes which needed a bit of TLC

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.040
and so I got started on approximately 75 loads of washing and yep

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:42.069
I'm trimming a coat

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.721
 and I made a pile of things to sell slash donate

00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:47.361
once I successfully turned my entire house into a laundromat

00:01:47.362 --> 00:01:50.081
it was time to get started on visually merchandizing my shit

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:52.521
and I'm a big fan of visually merchandizing your shit

00:01:52.522 --> 00:01:53.721
cause even though my cupboard is tiny

00:01:53.722 --> 00:01:54.921
doesn't mean she can't still be cute

00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:57.201
and I wanna open this door and feel like I'm stepping into a shop

00:01:57.202 --> 00:01:58.746
do you know what I mean this shop looks like 

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:00.121
it's just been the victim of a ram raid 

00:02:00.122 --> 00:02:01.201
but we'll get there

00:02:01.202 --> 00:02:02.361
and by the end of the afternoon

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:03.761
after a lot of interruptions

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:05.401
everything was finally where it needed to be

00:02:05.402 --> 00:02:06.961
and I was putting fresh sheets on the bed

00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:08.401
called it a day, had a wee sleep

00:02:08.402 --> 00:02:09.961
and then this is how we pulled up this morning

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:11.121
Can’t believe I'm showing you again

00:02:11.122 --> 00:02:12.481
but yep this is how we started

00:02:12.482 --> 00:02:13.801
and this is how we're looking now

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:14.401
full disclosure

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:16.152
I do still need to pop a couple of coats and 

00:02:16.153 --> 00:02:17.281
jackets in here when they dry

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:18.241
but there's plenty of room

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:20.021
and now I actually know what I own, which is good

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.840
I also sorted out my t shirts

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.561
my singlets old jerseys and pants

00:02:23.562 --> 00:02:24.921
and I even have a whole spare drawer

00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:26.241
which is exciting and in this cupboard

00:02:26.242 --> 00:02:27.641
I've got tracksuits Pjs

00:02:27.642 --> 00:02:29.481
loungewear and some spare activewear

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.121
but I'm super into my yoga at the moment

00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:33.241
and the hardest thing for me is actually finding my gear

00:02:33.242 --> 00:02:35.681
so I've dedicated a whole rack to all my favourite activewear

00:02:35.682 --> 00:02:37.121
so I can just get up in the morning

00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:38.901
choose an outfit and get to class
