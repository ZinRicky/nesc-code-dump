00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.080
In case anybody was just wondering what's going on,

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:05.141
my daughter did get in the goddamn musical.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.620
I didn't understand how it works.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.360
Um, she didn't get a call back for one of the roles that she wanted.

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:11.841
Like, it's.

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:13.721
I think they're doing Cinderella or some shit,

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.601
and she obviously, she wanted one of the. Oh,

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:18.221
that's right. She was trying out for one of the stepsisters.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.760
Cutely, because when we had.

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.281
One of my daughters had a make A wish trip,

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:23.601
she has a congenital heart disease,

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:24.641
and she's a make A wish kid.

00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:26.481
So we got sent to Disney World,

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:31.761
and the stepsisters were one of our favorite characters to meet,

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:33.761
so that's why it was, like,

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:37.161
really special to her to. And I always sing the stepsister songs.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:38.561
Like, that's a thing in our House.

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:41.101
Sweet, Sweet Night.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.520
So that's why I was triple hurt, because, like,

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:50.401
I always sing, like,

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:52.601
the stepsisters, and it's, like,

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:55.661
special to our family. Kinda like it has a little meaning.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.780
So she was trying out for one of the stepsisters.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.920
She didn't get a call back for the part,

00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:02.521
like, a named part in the musical,

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:05.581
but she did get cast in the ensemble.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.200
So she is gonna get to be on stage,

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:08.401
she's gonna get to sing, and she's,

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.961
you know, there are no small parts.

00:01:09.962 --> 00:01:12.861
She's gonna be one of the other voices that's like, oh,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.740
helping it to be a great production.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.240
I felt bad that I missed the audition,

00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:21.081
and I didn't get to, like,

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:25.221
cheer her on before the audition, but, um,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.020
everything worked out anyway.
