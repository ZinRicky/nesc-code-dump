00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
Is there anything more nerve wracking than speaking in public

00:03.361 --> 00:06.101
on a panel in front of thousands of people?

00:06.160 --> 00:08.120
For me personally, there isn't.

00:08.121 --> 00:11.881
And I spent all night tossing and turning cause I felt so anxious

00:11.882 --> 00:13.721
but also very excited.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.761
When business of fashion invited us to London to speak,

00:16.762 --> 00:19.141
I obviously could not say no.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.080
Think there's something so powerful about being intentional

00:22.081 --> 00:24.281
about how and when you use your voice.

00:24.282 --> 00:27.321
So this panel felt like the perfect environment for me

00:27.322 --> 00:31.561
and lucky to sit down and have a conversation about our journey,

00:31.562 --> 00:34.561
why we do what we do, our individual careers,

00:34.562 --> 00:36.361
and everything that comes with it.

00:36.362 --> 00:39.021
But before that, we were in mom and dad mode

00:39.040 --> 00:40.080
wanting to unwind

00:40.081 --> 00:42.761
and took whimsy on a little bike ride around the property

00:42.762 --> 00:44.481
to see all the little animals.

00:44.482 --> 00:47.061
Since it was a lot colder than we anticipated,

00:47.120 --> 00:49.120
we decided to head back early

00:49.121 --> 00:51.281
and drop her off at the cabin with my brother,

00:51.282 --> 00:53.601
who came all the way from Germany to watch her,

00:53.602 --> 00:56.041
which I always appreciate so much.

00:56.042 --> 00:58.121
This point I realized that it was 2:00,

00:58.122 --> 01:02.041
so we headed over to the barn all mic'd up and did a quick sound check,

01:02.042 --> 01:04.081
and I was so nervous at this point

01:04.082 --> 01:06.881
that I needed a hot cup of tea to calm me down.

01:06.882 --> 01:09.321
Rehearsals were still going strong at this point,

01:09.322 --> 01:11.741
so we took a seat and watched them all.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.840
Not long after that, the talk started

01:13.841 --> 01:16.381
and Hearing stories about perseverance

01:16.440 --> 01:20.800
overcoming the most difficult circumstances made me so emotional,

01:20.801 --> 01:22.921
and I tried not crying off my makeup,

01:22.922 --> 01:24.721
but then it was our turn to speak.

01:24.722 --> 01:27.641
Once I got on that panel, all my nerves disappeared,

01:27.642 --> 01:29.956
and it was the most beautiful experience.
