00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
I'm super frustrated with TikTok this morning.

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:05.701
Like, just heartened frustrated.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.060
I post homesteading, home making,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.160
home schooling videos, and my niche is cooking from scratch.

00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:14.621
Like, extreme scratch.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.940
Like, I start off with the animal on my homestead

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.980
and throughout the video get to a cooked meal.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.880
And for the most part, people love my videos.

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.821
I get millions of views. Um,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.060
my videos often go viral

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.960
and every single one of my videos only gets reported. Um,

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:35.721
even though I don't show the dispatcher of any animal

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:40.461
or show any stress of an animal or abuse of an animal,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.400
my videos reported. Normally I just appeal the video, um,

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:48.001
because the violation is for animal abuse.

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.221
And since there is no animal abuse,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.220
my video gets put back up and everyone gets to enjoy it.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.380
Except my, um,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.220
two or three videos back, I just got a violation. Um,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.100
bear in mind the same footage is used in several videos. Um,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.060
it shows me putting a chicken into a place where it's called a cone. Um,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.140
dispatch cone, I guess you'd say.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.880
Obviously doesn't show what I do there. Um,

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:18.381
which is, you know,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.560
ending the chicken. Doesn't show that.

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:22.441
It shows right after it. There's no blood.

00:01:22.442 --> 00:01:23.401
You don't see any of that stuff.

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:25.781
You don't see any of the stuff you don't wanna see.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.520
Most people have it just pop up on your FYP page.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:29.641
Do not wanna see that part,

00:01:29.642 --> 00:01:32.161
which I understand you are Free to scroll along.

00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:32.761
But, you know,

00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:35.101
some people just wanna have to tell me or report me.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.700
That's not something they wanna see.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.200
And with the guidelines, you cannot post that,

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:41.101
even though it would be very educational.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.180
But I understand why. So this time I.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.580
I pulled the video decision and it got denied.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.520
So that video that I worked really hard on was totally wiped off.

00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:58.961
I deleted it because I cannot speak to anyone from TikTok shop,

00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:00.841
TikTok at all when I put in a ticket.

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:02.881
And I wanna report, I wanna report

00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:04.841
there's an issue. I wanna.

00:02:04.842 --> 00:02:08.561
I wanna speak to somebody about why this video.

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:08.881
Like what.

00:02:08.882 --> 00:02:10.401
What was so different about this video?

00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:12.821
Even though it was up for nearly a week,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.720
it doesn't have any issues.

00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:16.881
It doesn't show anything that any of my other video show.

00:02:16.882 --> 00:02:18.001
I'm very careful how I edit.

00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:18.921
I'm not just, you know,

00:02:18.922 --> 00:02:19.801
oh, I'm missing something.

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:21.181
Like, I'm not missing anything.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.360
But then you go to report and then it won't send the.

00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:26.841
They just says not sent. Every time I go to chat,

00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:29.081
it's not sent. Every time I put in a ticket,

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.601
not sent it.

00:02:30.602 --> 00:02:34.601
TikTok is literally refusing for me to speak to them right now.

00:02:34.602 --> 00:02:37.281
I've restarted the app, I've redownloaded the app,

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:39.041
I've logged in, logged out.

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:43.081
It's just I cannot put a ticket in

00:02:43.082 --> 00:02:44.621
to understand

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.140
or speak to somebody about why my content has been deleted.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.000
Yeah, it's not On the Creator Rewards program anymore.

00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:54.001
I really don't care. It's not about that.

00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:55.481
It's the principle of it.

00:02:55.482 --> 00:03:00.081
That I can spend all my time making these videos that people like.

00:03:00.082 --> 00:03:01.441
People actually like my content.

00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:02.801
It's not just something I'm just like,

00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:03.321
oh, yeah,

00:03:03.322 --> 00:03:06.121
like, it's just something I wanna do.

00:03:06.122 --> 00:03:07.841
People in. This is educational stuff.

00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:09.361
People wanna know how to cook from scratch.

00:03:09.362 --> 00:03:11.921
People wanna know how to process a chicken.

00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:13.901
People wanna understand what they're eating.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.940
You know, it just feels like another way that.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.160
I don't like to be cliche,

00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:21.461
but the government can control your food.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.520
Like, the local government,

00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:24.321
the state government,

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:27.161
and the federal government do not like people making their own food.

00:03:27.162 --> 00:03:28.801
And I just got something to do with it.

00:03:28.802 --> 00:03:30.641
I don't know. I'm not a conspiracy theorist,

00:03:30.642 --> 00:03:32.761
but I'm just tryna share the knowledge

00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:36.081
of how you can easily raise your own meat.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:42.021
And you're not required to be part of the government food chain.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.720
You can take back control.

00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:46.521
You can learn the skills that your ancestors knew,

00:03:46.522 --> 00:03:48.681
and it's very easy. Um,

00:03:48.682 --> 00:03:53.261
we're desensitized to creating our own meat as a society.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.620
Many other cultures still do it this way,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.920
and if you look into it, these cultures don't have as many diseases

00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:01.541
and health problems as we do.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.400
Most of my comments on my videos are just, oh,

00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:07.081
this is on my. Why is this on my FYP page?

00:04:07.082 --> 00:04:08.161
While I'm eating chicken nuggets?

00:04:08.162 --> 00:04:09.321
Or While I'm eating Popeyes,

00:04:09.322 --> 00:04:11.421
it's just funny. People find it amusing.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.960
People have their eyes, like,

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.241
awoken to it. They. Yeah,

00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:17.481
most people for most people ever wanna know

00:04:17.482 --> 00:04:19.861
because that is very educational and they want to know.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.840
Other people are just like,

00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:24.481
have not even all about where their food comes from,

00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:26.161
and this is just like a wake up call for them.

00:04:26.162 --> 00:04:27.001
They're just like, oh man,

00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:28.041
this is where my food comes from.

00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:29.281
So they find it interesting.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.000
there's a few amount of people that get absolutely disgusted by it.

00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:34.761
And they will let me know in my DMs,

00:04:34.762 --> 00:04:37.381
you know, how horrible person I am,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.100
how absolutely disgusting I am.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.840
Even though that I care for my chickens.

00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:44.341
They're completely free range.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.460
They can go where they want their whole lives

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.280
up until about five minutes before their life has ended.

00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:51.601
Very swiftly, I pick them up,

00:04:51.602 --> 00:04:53.521
I hold onto them, I calm them down,

00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:58.641
I put them in the cone, and then they're dispatched very swiftly.

00:04:58.642 --> 00:04:59.761
They don't know what's coming,

00:04:59.762 --> 00:05:01.001
they don't feel any pain.

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:04.141
Because it's done so swiftly that there's no more pain receptors.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.680
Um, there's no,

00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:06.681
you know, they're not heads,

00:05:06.682 --> 00:05:08.001
not attached to their body anymore,

00:05:08.002 --> 00:05:10.681
so there's no way of them feeling that.

00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:11.961
Chickens flap around a lot,

00:05:11.962 --> 00:05:14.161
that's why they're in the cone. Um,

00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.121
and that's just how they are.

00:05:15.122 --> 00:05:17.361
Because the nerves and energy still in their body,

00:05:17.362 --> 00:05:18.901
they're not alive anymore.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.040
So we Use the cone as it's, um,

00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:23.521
an easier way to do it. They're not flapping around everywhere.

00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:25.821
There's no huge stress to us or the animal.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.840
Before it happens, they're in there and they feel in snug.

00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:29.121
And if you know anything about chickens,

00:05:29.122 --> 00:05:30.241
if you hold them upside down,

00:05:30.242 --> 00:05:32.321
they kind of relax, they calm down,

00:05:32.322 --> 00:05:34.541
they don't do anything. Um,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.260
and they're in a relaxed state.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.160
So if you compare that to how factory chickens are done.

00:05:40.161 --> 00:05:43.841
They live their whole lives in these huge chicken barns, um,

00:05:43.842 --> 00:05:45.521
that are completely packed in with chickens.

00:05:45.522 --> 00:05:47.401
I mean, no room to. Sorry.

00:05:47.402 --> 00:05:49.581
My kids like going through all the drawers in the kitchen.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.680
They have no room to move around.

00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:53.441
Um, they spend their whole life inside.

00:05:53.442 --> 00:05:54.641
They don't even see daylight.

00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:56.601
No fresh air, no grass to peck.

00:05:56.602 --> 00:05:58.481
Chickens love free ranging.

00:05:58.482 --> 00:05:59.601
They love pecking the grass,

00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:02.221
eating the bugs and just being free.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.920
And then they're swiftly ended.

00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:05.521
And these are normally Cornish cross.

00:06:05.522 --> 00:06:08.941
They only live for about. I think it's nine weeks.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.680
Could be wrong on that one.

00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:12.381
I think it's nine weeks. Um,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.960
if you let them grow any longer than that,

00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:15.681
they get tumors, cancer.

00:06:15.682 --> 00:06:16.841
Their legs can't hold them up,

00:06:16.842 --> 00:06:17.761
their organs fail

00:06:17.762 --> 00:06:22.201
because they are genetically engineered to just grow breasts.

00:06:22.202 --> 00:06:24.961
So their breasts will start hanging on the ground.

00:06:24.962 --> 00:06:26.881
Um, they'll drag their bodies around.

00:06:26.882 --> 00:06:27.921
Pretty much they'll just lay around.

00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:29.341
They have hardly any feathers.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.320
Um, they have a Pretty disgusting existence.

00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:35.261
So people to tell me that what I'm doing is disgusting,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.900
but then again, they eat Popeyes,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.220
Chick fil A, then that's disgusting.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.280
Anyway, I would like to continue to share my knowledge

00:06:44.281 --> 00:06:46.241
of the way that I produce food

00:06:46.242 --> 00:06:49.741
in my own home and share that with you.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.780
Um, and if anyone else would like to share a lot,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.260
enjoy my education, then please follow.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.320
Um, right now my videos are pretty much shadowbanned,

00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:00.121
so not getting many views,

00:07:00.122 --> 00:07:01.061
but, you know,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.560
I'm happy to share my knowledge

00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:05.001
and continue to get past this point on TikTok

00:07:05.002 --> 00:07:07.421
and continue with my account.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.600
I also have a great blog that I started, um,

00:07:10.601 --> 00:07:12.681
that I've been wanting to start for so many years.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:16.081
And my recent test on TikTok has made me

00:07:16.082 --> 00:07:17.481
inspired me to get back into it,

00:07:17.482 --> 00:07:19.041
so I'm on there. Um,

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:22.961
I have more detailed instructions on how to process and cook

00:07:22.962 --> 00:07:24.641
and some recipes to go along with it.

00:07:24.642 --> 00:07:28.029
So I'm here, so hopefully you enjoy it.
