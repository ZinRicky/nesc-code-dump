Does your kid have a weird obsession?

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.100
Mine does, and it's the Titanic.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.320
That being said,

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:09.061
I grabbed this Titanic brick building set that I found on TikTok Shop.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.360
This set seems to be inspired by the movie

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:12.721
and even comes with Jack and rose.

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:15.621
My son added this little bit right here with the floating door.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.160
Inside is not to scale, but it does have some cool feature.

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:21.661
It has them staircase and Rose's apartment

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.040
and also has the safe in the cargo area in the back.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.321
This is also where the light switches.

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:27.701
So it does have a light kit.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.740
And of course, you couldn't be without the heart of the ocean.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.200
Even though none of this is the scout,

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.281
it's still kind of fun to have the stuff to put inside

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:38.221
and it's kind of a playable piece.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.800
My son did need help with this.

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:42.741
He is 7 years old and it was a complicated piece,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.140
so a great set to bond over with a parent.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.560
This set was so much fun,

00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:49.921
and it's gonna be a great display piece with the light kit.

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:52.561
