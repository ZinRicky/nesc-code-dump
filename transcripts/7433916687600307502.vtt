00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.400
this is my first time voting

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:04.760
my first election and I'm more than excited

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:08.000
I feel like my goal is my voice and um

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:12.540
I'm just excited to have been able to use it and express exactly how I feel

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.700
who I feel but best represent me and those that I love and care around

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.520
Itâ€™s the perfect opportunity to exercise your right as a United States citizen

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.640
and it gives you

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:22.320
the power to

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:25.080
dictate your own future and for me

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:26.640
voting just means

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:27.800
it's important to me

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:31.160
it's important to the people that laid the groundwork for me to vote

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:33.680
as a black woman and the people future

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:35.520
if I plan on having kids

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.600
this affects them for sure

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:40.120
this affects all the communities that I care about

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:44.600
so I just feel voting is just a very important mechanism to um

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:47.240
just take control of your future

00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:49.040
your past absolutely vote

00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:50.580
you should absolutely vote

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.520
this is one of the most important elections that will come across

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:59.540
it's a historic moment and to be a part of history is an amazing thing

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.600
no matter whether you don't like either candidate

00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:06.240
I feel like voting is so important for everyone around you

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:07.280
not just yourself like

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:08.920
this is not a selfish moment at all

00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:11.560
like this is a pivotal moment for the entire country

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:12.960
everyone you love and care about

00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:16.920
so it is so important to go out and vote and act like

00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:19.660
use your right as citizen what power you have
