00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.720
phew so a lot of you been asking me how I'm doing since the whole

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:06.600
I didn't realize that there was some Wick and Dorito cult that

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:08.119
well they're talking about this

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.640
I'm in Arizona see the cactuses

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.000
fighting for reproductive rights

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.240
trying to talk to any person that I can

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:16.900
to try and keep this country safe for all of us

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.680
the right wing media ecosystem thrives on concocting fake scandals like this

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:24.360
in order to keep their audiences engaged

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:25.480
and enslamed

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:29.360
so whether it's about feminist women or Haitian immigrants eating pets

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:33.520
it's all meant to distract and divide us

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:37.300
and these fabrications become real just because they keep talking about them

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.880
there are forces who want to divide us

00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:42.080
and one of them is running for president

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:47.160
a man who just threatened to use the military against US citizens

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.380
to fight the enemy from within

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.540
I don't see anybody in this country as Miami

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.560
but the man running for president is banking on us doing that

00:00:56.561 --> 00:01:00.480
and I've now seen firsthand how the right wing machine fuels that division

00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:06.420
in order to help him we cannot afford to let them tear us apart

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.440
women are dying from abortion bans

00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:11.520
people can afford their groceries because of price gouging

00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.120
and two hurricanes just decimated people's homes

00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:18.760
we need real solutions not division

00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:22.120
so let's take all of this energy and put it into the next two weeks

00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:25.200
I know this is a really close election okay

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:25.720
I know that

00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:28.080
that feels very terrifying

00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:29.660
but here's why that's exciting

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.920
every single little thing that you do matters okay

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:36.240
it means that this is gonna come down to a few votes

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:40.220
which means that if you can impact or influence one person's vote

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.480
you are making a really big difference

00:01:43.481 --> 00:01:45.400
every single small thing that you do

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:49.620
could be the tipping point that decides who gets the keys to the White House

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.140
let's take all of this energy

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.020
put it into talking to each other

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.080
deep canvassing day canvassing

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.520
the more we work together

00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:00.980
the less they can chip away at our future

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.200
sorry I had to

00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:03.145
I had to do it I love you bye
