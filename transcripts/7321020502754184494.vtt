00:00.080 --> 00:02.200
I had a company reach out and ask if I would like to

00:02.200 --> 00:03.200
try their juicer.

00:03.200 --> 00:05.580
Thought it would be perfect to try out.

00:20.000 --> 00:20.760
Okay. So far,

00:20.760 --> 00:22.080
it is working great.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.000
I'm loving it.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.040
I thought it would just be

00:24.040 --> 00:25.200
fun to experiment with some apples,

00:25.200 --> 00:26.600
so I'm just gonna add apple juice,

00:26.600 --> 00:27.840
mix it with my celery juice,

00:27.840 --> 00:29.420
and I'm gonna peel them first.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.800
Okay. I'm really impressed with this little juicer.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.400
I think it's great.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.120
It's loud, but it's just as loud as my other juicer.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.160
And this one takes up,

00:42.160 --> 00:43.840
like, hardly any counter space.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.040
My other juicer is massive, and it was, like, $200,

00:46.040 --> 00:47.200
so I like this.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.500
There's all the junk.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.640
We're all done with

00:54.640 --> 00:58.240
my first batch of juice from this little juicer,

00:58.240 --> 00:59.840
and I have to say, I am very,

00:59.840 --> 01:02.680
very pleasantly surprised by how well it works.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.120
And you can go check it out.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.480
I think it's on sale right now,

01:05.480 --> 01:07.360
so be sure to look into that.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.480
This one is so simple,

01:08.480 --> 01:10.300
and I love it so far.
