00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
All over the house. All I hear is it's Tim your.

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:04.961
I like it. So we looked it up.

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:07.281
It means effectively modest,

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:12.481
reserved or serious koi. Its meaning has only shifted slightly.

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:14.881
While it began solely as a descriptive term

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:17.401
for people of quiet modesty

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:19.661
and set, sedate reserve,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.420
those who don't draw attention to themselves,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.920
whether because of a shy nature or determined self control,

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:29.321
it came to be applied also to those whose modesty and reservation

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:33.221
is more affectation than sincere expression.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.080
While demure sounds French

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:36.721
and entered the language at a time

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:38.161
when the native tongue of England

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:40.541
was borrowing many French words from the Normans,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.840
the etymology evidence requires that we exercise restraint.

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:46.501
The words origin remains obscure,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.460
but now we know that demure means reserved, modest.
