00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.640
So this is the first day in about a week and a half

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.601
that I've actually been home

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:08.040
with the intention of staying home for the entire week.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.921
Matt and I went to Utah last weekend,

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:12.961
and then we had one day, and then we went up to North Carolina,

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:15.921
where we were donating supplies and helping with relief efforts.

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:18.241
So today is like a Monday reset day,

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:20.701
and I already. It's almost 2:00.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.560
I have made chili. I've gone to the grocery store.

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:25.601
I've taught my kids their lesson.

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:27.401
I'm about to do another load of laundry,

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:28.521
and I just can't wait to.

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:31.021
All five members of my family are home tonight.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.200
We're eating chilly in, like, sweatshirts.

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.201
It's still really hot here,

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:35.801
by the way. It's not like sweatshirt weather,

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.661
but we're gonna make it sweatshirt weather.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.660
And we're watching Twilight and cuddling.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.100
That's all I wanna do for the next five days.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.280
I'm also gonna need. Oh,

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:47.201
I also decorated the outside of our house for Halloween today,

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:48.961
so I'm gonna need the weather to get on board.

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:50.721
I'm gonna need it to be chilly now,

00:00:50.722 --> 00:00:52.201
because all I wanna do is, like,

00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:54.961
hide away like a Hobbit in a hole in my house.

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:58.361
I'm ready to go nowhere and see no one for a very long time.
