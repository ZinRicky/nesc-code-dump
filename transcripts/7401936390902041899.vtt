00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Is making your own butter better?

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.200
I think it is, but

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.121
there is certain requirements

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:05.941
for it to be better than store bought butter.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.280
Like buying regular

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:11.681
low grade cream from Walmart and blending it does create butter,

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:14.281
but it's gonna be the exact same quality of butter

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.621
that you get from Walmart,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.200
where there's nothing wrong with that butter.

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:20.161
I still buy that sometimes and I use it when I'm baking a lot.

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:21.601
If you want better butter,

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.981
you're gonna have to get better cream to create that butter.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.480
We have our own Jersey dairy cow,

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:30.321
so she has very high fat content in her milk.

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:33.281
And this is raw cream, so it hasn't been pasteurized,

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:36.601
has not been homogenized. So we milk the cow,

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:37.441
we put it in the fridge,

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.861
and the next day the cream will separate on top of the milk.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.560
Then I just scoop the cream off top of the milk

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:47.161
before the kids drink it, cause they don't like it full fat in that way.

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:48.481
It's just kinda too chunky.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:49.561
As you shake up the cream,

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:51.761
it's kinda like got chunks of cream in it,

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:52.801
and I actually don't mind that,

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:54.661
but the kids just don't like the texture, so.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
And I use the cream for my coffee.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:58.041
I absolutely love it. So right here

00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:00.761
I'm using ice water to press the butter

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:03.261
to make sure all the buttermilk is out of the butter.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.040
Because if you leave buttermilk inside the butter,

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:09.881
it will Go rancid fast because the buttermilk goes rancid or sour,

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:10.601
so you'll start having, like,

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:14.601
a sour butter taste. And the water from my faucet comes out warm,

00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:16.081
cause we're in Georgia, even on the cold setting.

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:18.201
So I do use an ice water bath.

00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:19.941
And then I'm gonna salt the butter.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.080
Um, some recipes,

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.441
I don't like to use salted butter,

00:01:22.442 --> 00:01:24.281
but if I want it to preserve,

00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:25.641
I'm gonna have to put some salt in it.

00:01:25.642 --> 00:01:27.201
Here I'm using a butter crock.

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:28.161
This stays on the counter.

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:30.781
This has got water in it, so it creates a water seal.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.920
So this will stay on the counter.

00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:33.361
I can use this for up to a week,

00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:35.521
and I can use it for anything I want.

00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:37.521
Soft butter on the rest of this butter,

00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:39.521
I'm gonna salt it. Even though I'm gonna put it in the fridge,

00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:40.521
I'm gonna salt it still

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:43.281
because it's got lots of moisture in it from washing it,

00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:45.361
and it might still have a little bit of buttermilk in it.

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:47.441
So I'm gonna use that salt to preserve

00:01:47.442 --> 00:01:49.641
and soak up any moisture that's in the butter

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.921
to stop it from going sour faster.

00:01:51.922 --> 00:01:53.281
I want it to last, um,

00:01:53.282 --> 00:01:54.961
I think it normally last about a month in the fridge.

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:57.241
I've not really had butter go sour in the fridge.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:00.001
I use it fast enough. If you want to preserve it longer,

00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:01.361
you could wrap it in this paper,

00:02:01.362 --> 00:02:03.421
put it in a ziploc, Bag and put it in the freezer.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.440
So from the cream I had for my cow,

00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:07.981
I have now got some butter and buttermilk to make some biscuits.
