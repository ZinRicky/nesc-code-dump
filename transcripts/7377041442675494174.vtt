00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.680
A day in my life as a tribewife content creator

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:03.941
what people think edition.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.480
I wake up at about 11:00am.

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:06.481
After sleeping in,

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:07.281
I checked my phone

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:09.881
and the algorithm smiled favorably upon me last night,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.480
I've gained 50,000 followers since I last checked my phone at 2:00am.

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:15.321
Since I am the main bread winner,

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:17.401
my husband makes us a gourmet breakfast

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:19.481
while I give him his to do list for today.

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:21.281
We have two videos to make for brands,

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:23.401
and while my husband doesn't really like to be on camera,

00:00:23.402 --> 00:00:27.721
I'm the boss, and these brands are paying me $20,000 a video.

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:28.441
After breakfast,

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:30.521
I get dressed in my Tread Wife cosplay

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:33.161
and we get started filming the first video.

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:36.341
Our goal here is to look like a happy couple in love,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which is hard,

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:43.381
but honestly, I'm so good at acting that no one even questions it.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.120
After we film the videos,

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:46.461
I change into a, like,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.560
normal outfit

00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:50.521
and we take our Mercedes to the dealership to get an oil change

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:52.521
and get dinner at a five star restaurant

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:55.541
where three people recognized me and asked for my autograph.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.120
Being an influencer is so hard,

00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:00.581
I wish I was just like a normal person.
