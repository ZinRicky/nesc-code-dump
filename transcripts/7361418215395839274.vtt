00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.280
my thing is once I love you

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:02.361
like I will love you forever

00:00:02.362 --> 00:00:03.921
and I feel like this is like for every situation

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:04.801
but specifically

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:06.161
specifically for friendships and like

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:07.161
platonic relationship

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:10.061
I just like there is a part of me that will always

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.180
care about the people that used to be friends with me

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.080
and like I don't know if it's because I have ADHD

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:18.401
so I like literally forget things that happen in my life

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:19.441
and I you know

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:22.681
luckily I think I'm able to remember the positive

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:25.281
and so what I do remember is positive um

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:26.841
but I do I think because of that

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.441
forget when people have done me dirty

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:29.121
but honestly like

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:31.401
I'm happy about it because I would much rather

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:34.201
I think move for the world with love than without

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:36.321
and I genuinely don't care what the situation is

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:38.481
like if at some point me and you are friends

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:39.401
even if we don't talk

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:40.441
even if we got into falling out

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:40.921
I what

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:45.241
I don't care if I had love for you at one point in my life and you need me or

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:46.961
like you need someone or like

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:48.841
you know something is going on and

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:49.641
or even if you feel like

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:51.001
wanna reach out and like

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:51.761
talk and like

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:53.441
talk it out and like

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:56.361
you know rekindle and apologize whatever

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:59.841
like I am always willing to hear someone out

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:02.561
especially if I have had love for them in the past

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.881
I just like because it

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:06.441
when I think back to that time period in my life when we were friends

00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:07.681
even if we're not friends now

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:10.981
like I will think of you and I will think of you fond despite

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.720
you know whatever might have happened

00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:15.001
and I think a lot of relationships that have been

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:16.281
in the past have run their course

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:17.001
you know but like

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:18.401
there were still always be

00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:21.401
you know pieces of my heart with these people that were like

00:01:21.402 --> 00:01:23.441
there for monumental like

00:01:23.442 --> 00:01:25.439
you know milestones in my life I don't know
