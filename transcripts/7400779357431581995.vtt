00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.480
List of things that make men instantly more hot

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:07.961
starting off with No. 1 when they're unaware of how attractive they are

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:10.961
when men are oblivious to how attractive they are

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:13.421
it's just an instant pantry dropper

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.720
men who are aware of this are kind of the worst

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.721
No. two when a man has five o'clock shadow

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:20.761
okay this is a personal preference

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:22.081
but it gets me every time

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:24.841
No. three when he has a low voice

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:26.421
not like a Barry White boy

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.240
but a nice low voice

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:31.521
can make someone's less attractive qualities way more attractive

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:33.681
Iâ€™ve developed a crush on a voice alone

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:36.721
No. 4 the ability to have banter

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:40.681
there's nothing worse than trying to have witty banter with a brick wall

00:00:40.682 --> 00:00:42.761
that actually makes guys less attractive

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:45.481
No. five smelling like a man

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:48.821
and not necessarily anything that's sold out of a bottle

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.520
just light pheromones 

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:53.801
that scent is so darn appealing to any woman

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:56.781
No. six when he only has eyes for you

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.840
if you're going out on a date with him and he's looking all around

00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:00.961
that's not attractive

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:05.380
But when he only has eyes for you that is so attractive 

00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:08.361
and if you do this you'll probably get lucky

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:12.421
No. 7 when he says your name unexpectedly

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.720
there's just something so powerful about when a man says your name

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:20.301
No. 8 when he can at least cook one meal well

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.180
He doesn't have to be Gordon Ramsay

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.000
but there's nothing better than waking up the next morning

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.641
and he's prepared you eggs, bacon pancakes

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:28.864
that's hot 

00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:30.378
No. 9 loving your pets 

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:33.801
there's nothing cuter than when a man likes your pet

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.647
is just so adorable 

00:01:35.648 --> 00:01:38.761
No. 10 not answering texts when he's with you

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:40.601
at least for the first couple days

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:42.483
Full attention means respect
