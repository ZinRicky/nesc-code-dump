00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.360
As a woman who spent 10 years as a tribe wife,

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:06.681
and I birthed four children unmedicated,

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:08.881
and I cloth diaper them, and I homeschooled,

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:12.081
and I baked our bread, and I made our meals from scratch,

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:13.381
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.180
That Ballerina Farms article was so triggering,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.460
because you can hear the sadness in her voice.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.060
You can.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.360
What's funny is to sometimes,

00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:27.601
like, hearing about other people's story,

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:28.761
it helps validate yours. Like,

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:29.881
I remember I would get this, like,

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:31.721
mystery illness, and that's what we called it.

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:32.561
We called it, oh,

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:34.081
Mommy's got her mystery illness.

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:36.781
Where it wasn't necessarily the flu.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.960
We didn't know what it was.

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:39.601
I just got, like,

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:41.241
really sick, and I'd have, like,

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:43.121
a fever on and off and chills

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.121
and just, like,

00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:46.601
like, literally couldn't get up and do anything for,

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:47.781
like, a week or two.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.620
And funny enough, once I got a divorce and became a single mom,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.280
I never got this mystery illness anymore.

00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:58.801
I, I was just thinking about that, like, wow,

00:00:58.802 --> 00:01:00.781
that doesn't happen anymore. Like,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.840
there are so many things to touch on in that article,

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:07.641
and I'm a little bit obsessed about it,

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:09.641
and I'm gonna talk about each and every issue.

00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:13.241
Because I lived her exact life.

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:14.641
Maybe I didn't have the same farm,

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:16.261
but I did have the same isolation.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.760
Maybe I didn't have eight kids,

00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:21.361
but I had four. Maybe I wasn't in a pageant after one of them,

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:22.321
but I Did have one.

00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:26.361
Have open heart surgery a week before I gave birth to the next one.

00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:29.101
Like, I've been in really similar situations,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.880
you know,

00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:36.441
I think a lot of women can relate to her story and what she's doing.

00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:40.241
And you can kind of see how we try to be the little

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:42.201
perfect trophy for the one guy that's there

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.401
that we thought was gonna provide us a beautiful,

00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:46.321
amazing life. But then when it comes time to it,

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:47.861
you get a fucking egg apron.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.900
You don't even get what he fucking promised you you were gonna get.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.820
Like,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.860
the fact that this woman has eight children at her age.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.240
Oh, my god.

00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:02.541
Some women are on their eighth fucking vacation

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.400
that they paid for themselves and shit.

00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:07.301
Like,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.160
we have so much more to offer the world

00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:13.421
than our fucking reproductive system,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.120
and that's so hard on your body.

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:17.021
Oh, my god.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.220
I don't even know where to begin,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.800
but I'm literally obsessed with this.

00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:23.912
I'm not. Oh, my god.
