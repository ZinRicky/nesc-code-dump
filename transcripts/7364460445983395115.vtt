00:00.080 --> 00:02.520
My husband and I are raising two kids on one income

00:02.521 --> 00:04.081
and here's how we make it work.

00:04.082 --> 00:06.521
The very first thing is that we don't spend a lot of money.

00:06.522 --> 00:08.281
Almost all of our clothes for myself,

00:08.282 --> 00:11.721
my husband and our sons are from thrift stores or second hand.

00:11.722 --> 00:14.961
I'm not above going into goodwill and coming out with a bunch of stuff.

00:14.962 --> 00:18.161
I also never buy anything at goodwill without the 20% off coupon.

00:18.162 --> 00:18.961
Get those in your email,

00:18.962 --> 00:20.081
you get one every month.

00:20.082 --> 00:21.881
I sell all our used clothes on Poshmark.

00:21.882 --> 00:24.921
We do not buy new cars, and for a long time we only had one car.

00:24.922 --> 00:26.201
I buy generic groceries

00:26.202 --> 00:29.761
and I do hardcore couponing and downloading all the apps.

00:29.762 --> 00:32.921
So I very, very rarely will buy anything. Food,

00:32.922 --> 00:36.441
clothes, anything that isn't deeply discounted.

00:36.442 --> 00:37.921
We don't go on crazy vacations.

00:37.922 --> 00:39.921
We just do a lot of fun things around the house.

00:39.922 --> 00:41.601
We try make our backyard fun.

00:41.602 --> 00:44.001
Like I said, I like to sell things on Poshmark.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.961
I also like to do little content creation things.

00:46.962 --> 00:50.361
I work for companies and I'll create content for them.

00:50.362 --> 00:52.401
It isn't like a full time income or anything,

00:52.402 --> 00:54.521
but it is enough to,

00:54.522 --> 00:56.401
you know, make things easier for us.

00:56.402 --> 00:58.961
So a lot of times while the kids are napping or after their sleep,

00:58.962 --> 01:01.161
that's when I'll kind of do my little like, side work.

01:01.162 --> 01:05.161
Well, where I'll sell stuff on the internet or I'll do TikTok stuff.

01:05.162 --> 01:06.441
I'll do Instagram stuff,

01:06.442 --> 01:09.281
I'll do just user generated content for different companies

01:09.282 --> 01:10.241
and I really enjoy doing that.

01:10.242 --> 01:12.921
It gives me kind of like a creative outlet. And, you know,

01:12.922 --> 01:14.501
a little bit of money doesn't hurt.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.360
Basically, a lot of those little money saving things,

01:17.361 --> 01:20.201
a lot of those little money making things add up to a lot.

01:20.202 --> 01:21.601
Especially when you offset it

01:21.602 --> 01:23.601
with how much we would have to spend on daycare.

01:23.602 --> 01:25.561
It's something we decided very early on,

01:25.562 --> 01:27.921
right before my first baby was born.

01:27.922 --> 01:28.521
Have a degree,

01:28.522 --> 01:29.441
I had a good job,

01:29.442 --> 01:31.241
but I wanted to be home with him.

01:31.242 --> 01:32.321
And we looked at the numbers

01:32.322 --> 01:35.441
and it was clear that we were going to have to live very, very,

01:35.442 --> 01:36.681
very frugally if we were gonna do that.

01:36.682 --> 01:39.641
But again, it was worth the trade off for us.

01:39.642 --> 01:40.761
And it might not be for everyone,

01:40.762 --> 01:42.921
it might not always work for everyone,

01:42.922 --> 01:45.721
but I do think it is a lot more doable

01:45.722 --> 01:48.441
and a lot more realistic than a lot of people think.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.121
You just have to be very disciplined

01:50.122 --> 01:53.761
and you have to kind of not think in the consumer

01:53.762 --> 01:56.744
materialist way that so many people think today.
