00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.480
something we do not talk about enough is the colossal scale of male violence

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:10.200
men are the majority of perpetrators of nearly every single violent crime

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:12.900
by a landslide— murder,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.280
SA, stalking,

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.880
mass shootings —you name it

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:20.820
and for some of these were talking like over 90% were committed by men

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.920
but every year we spend all of our time and energy

00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:27.800
debating to what extent we should control women

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:30.080
we call them murderers for their abortions

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:32.280
we threaten them we demonize them

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.920
and then you consider the fact that every year

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:37.960
tens of thousands of these women who are seeking abortions

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:38.920
are doing so

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:43.640
because they have been a victim of a man's violent crime against her

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:47.040
and then we have the audacity to label her murderer

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:50.400
to make her take off work and fly to a safe state

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.480
(and that's if she's lucky)

00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:54.080
at her own expense and if she can't do that

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.620
she'll have to risk her health and life

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.780
performing non consensual reproductive labor for her government

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.880
it is like the crime just repeating itself

00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:07.800
the man takes her body and then the government just does the same

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:12.040
and this collective focus on women and their abortions

00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:15.360
and what we should do about it is absolutely deliberate

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:18.080
it is a projection of male violence

00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:20.640
it is gaslighting on a whole

00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:24.440
another level and it's a way to distract from where the pain

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:28.420
and suffering in our communities is actually coming from
