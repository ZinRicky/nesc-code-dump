My husband and I met when we were working the same job.

00:02.921 --> 00:06.561
I was walking a fashion show that he was attending and watching.

00:06.562 --> 00:08.601
And I love how now, five years later,

00:08.602 --> 00:11.161
we still get to model together and work together.

00:11.162 --> 00:14.441
And this was our first family shoot with all of our kids,

00:14.442 --> 00:16.501
which felt so, so special.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.920
Shot this a few months back when whimsy was only six weeks old.

00:19.921 --> 00:21.801
And it's crazy to think about that

00:21.802 --> 00:24.801
she's been on almost 10 shoots ever since she was born

00:24.802 --> 00:25.841
three months ago.

00:25.842 --> 00:29.041
A lot of people don't realize that both lucky and I are models.

00:29.042 --> 00:31.721
And we've been working ever since we've been really young.

00:31.722 --> 00:34.021
I got scouted when I was fourteen.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.000
He started at a young age as well.

00:36.001 --> 00:38.801
So this is something that we've been doing for a while.

00:38.802 --> 00:42.961
Shot this GQ hype cover on a little ranch in Texas.

00:42.962 --> 00:45.361
We got to hang out with a bunch of different animals.

00:45.362 --> 00:47.201
The kids absolutely loved it.

00:47.202 --> 00:49.801
We also shot a GQ couples quiz,

00:49.802 --> 00:52.821
which was nerve wracking, but it turned out really nice.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.640
Shot a handful of Lux and it was so hot in Texas.

00:56.641 --> 01:00.161
It was over 100 degrees, so we were sweating all day long,

01:00.162 --> 01:02.521
especially carrying animals around.

01:02.522 --> 01:06.641
But it was all worth it. Last shot of the day was the hype cover.

01:06.642 --> 01:08.881
We shot this right when the sun was setting,

01:08.882 --> 01:11.801
which made it so magical. And as soon as we wrapped,

01:11.802 --> 01:14.863
I couldn't Wait to get home and have some ice cream on the couch.
