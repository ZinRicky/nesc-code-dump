WEBVTT

00:00.080 --> 00:05.780
We have. The UK Times is coming out and doing a profile piece,

00:07.240 --> 00:08.280
so we're getting ready for that.

00:08.281 --> 00:10.521
They're just gonna shadow us during the day

00:10.522 --> 00:17.521
just as we make meals and be a mom and create content.

00:17.522 --> 00:18.921
Just getting our makeup on,

00:18.922 --> 00:23.541
Miss Flora and I.

00:23.600 --> 00:30.460
We're also going to do a little family photo shoot out in the meadow.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.160
They want me in, like,

00:32.161 --> 00:34.141
a gown, huh?

00:36.920 --> 00:38.220
My oregano.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.000
Oregano.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.500
I wonder how you doing today?

00:56.760 --> 00:57.560
Say

01:00.640 --> 01:02.020
hi, Pedro.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.620
Gotta go get some ground beef and get it thined for lunch.

01:06.120 --> 01:10.560
Was it Urban Monkey?

01:10.561 --> 01:11.881
Yeah. Oh,

01:11.882 --> 01:14.161
I know exactly that. Well,

01:14.162 --> 01:15.401
because she just caps,

01:15.402 --> 01:16.501
so she's really.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.100
Oh, yeah.

01:22.640 --> 01:26.120
Mabel, Mabel,

01:26.121 --> 01:27.981
Mabel! And then back at me.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.460
Nice. Hey,

01:34.880 --> 01:36.460

01:41.160 --> 01:42.355
No.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.980
Okay, so we

01:50.360 --> 01:52.520
have done a lot today.

01:52.521 --> 01:53.841
Kitchen stuff,

01:53.842 --> 01:56.441
farm stuff. Boys are roping right now,

01:56.442 --> 01:59.021
and I am going to get into a gown.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.500
Kom Igjen!

02:11.680 --> 02:14.940
Yeah!

02:17.680 --> 02:18.700
This is awesome.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.820
Oh, this is beautiful.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.380
Everyone look at your dad.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.580
