00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.440
We've been taught that women don't belong in the kitchen

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.720
because it's a waste of time,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.720
demeaning. Because cooking is too hard and takes too much time.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.000
And that quality food is best purchased in a package.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.120
This has caused us to become fully disconnected from our food source.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.280
We don't work with our hands.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.020
We don't know where our food is from or how it was produced.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.880
Nutrient density has no meaning when we eat their processed foods

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.880
and their convenience foods,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.400
their food that shouldn't be considered food.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.760
We fill their pockets with money.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.400
Today, society is sicker than ever.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.360
Disease is rampant.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.200
But does anyone wonder why we become so disconnected from our food?

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.920
That we have forgotten that food is thy medicine

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.375
and thy medicine is thy food?
