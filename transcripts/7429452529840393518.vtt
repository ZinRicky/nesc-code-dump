When my sister texted me where I wanted to go for dinner,

00:03.201 --> 00:05.641
I remembered that I'd never been to Din Tai Fung,

00:05.642 --> 00:07.801
so that's exactly where she took me.

00:07.802 --> 00:11.721
After an hour wait, we sat down and filled out a little order cards.

00:11.722 --> 00:14.421
After she made us our little sauce concoctions,

00:14.640 --> 00:16.280
brought out the garlic green beans,

00:16.281 --> 00:19.281
the pork soup dumplings, and the cucumber salad.

00:19.282 --> 00:21.601
This cucumber salad was so good

00:21.602 --> 00:24.121
and probably my favorite thing that we ordered.

00:24.122 --> 00:27.361
And even though Piper was raving about these soup dumplings,

00:27.362 --> 00:29.001
I found them quite underwhelming,

00:29.002 --> 00:31.201
to be honest. They weren't that hot,

00:31.202 --> 00:32.841
and they were just lacking flavor.

00:32.842 --> 00:34.601
But I really enjoyed the green beans.

00:34.602 --> 00:37.681
And these stir fried rice cakes were so good,

00:37.682 --> 00:40.161
which I haven't heard people talk about these ones.

00:40.162 --> 00:42.961
We got the pork noodle, and I'm not even gonna talk about it

00:42.962 --> 00:44.881
because it wasn't worth talking about.

00:44.882 --> 00:47.521
I also got the honey lemonade with some Boba in it,

00:47.522 --> 00:51.121
which I found quite good. We're skipping over the mushroom fried rice.

00:51.122 --> 00:54.761
I didn't realize how much food we ordered until it all came out.

00:54.762 --> 00:58.121
The spicy noodles and spicy wontons were so fragrant.

00:58.122 --> 01:00.801
Not too spicy. I was bursting at the seams,

01:00.802 --> 01:02.081
but needed something sweet.

01:02.082 --> 01:05.041
So we got the chocolate dumplings with sea salt foam.

01:05.042 --> 01:06.281
These weren't my favorite,

01:06.282 --> 01:10.301
but I was so tired and the restaurant was closing, so we headed home.
