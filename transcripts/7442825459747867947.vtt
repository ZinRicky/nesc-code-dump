00:00.040 --> 00:03.680
When my kids rushed down the stairs asking me for a hot chocolate

00:03.681 --> 00:05.561
because it's gotten quite cold,

00:05.562 --> 00:06.841
I got so excited

00:06.842 --> 00:10.861
and decided to start making them some marshmallows to go on top.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.680
Started by blooming my gelatin

00:12.681 --> 00:15.281
and then combining some maple syrup and water,

00:15.282 --> 00:19.261
heating that up, adding that to the gelatin with some vanilla,

00:19.320 --> 00:22.840
and then transferring the marshmallow fluff over to a tray

00:22.841 --> 00:26.061
lined with some powdered sugar and aero root powder.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.320
Made sure it was spread all even,

00:28.321 --> 00:32.121
letting that harden slightly for about four to five hours.

00:32.122 --> 00:34.361
Decided to make small star marshmallows,

00:34.362 --> 00:36.781
so I kept repeating that process

00:36.840 --> 00:39.680
until I had all my Little Star marshmallows.

00:39.681 --> 00:42.601
I don't know what it is, but my children don't like whipped cream,

00:42.602 --> 00:44.241
so I didn't make them any,

00:44.242 --> 00:46.281
which saved me a little bit of time.

00:46.282 --> 00:48.081
After I set the marshmallows aside,

00:48.082 --> 00:50.101
I started on my hot chocolate,

00:50.200 --> 00:51.560
combining milk, sugar,

00:51.561 --> 00:54.521
cacao powder. While that was warming up on the stove,

00:54.522 --> 00:57.081
I added some cut up chocolate to that,

00:57.082 --> 00:59.921
kept whisking it until all the chocolate was melted,

00:59.922 --> 01:02.221
and then poured it into their little cups,

01:02.280 --> 01:04.180
topped it with my marshmallows.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.246
They were so excited and wanted more immediately after.
