00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.880
They say those who can't do, teach.

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:03.041
I was once a tried wife.

00:00:03.042 --> 00:00:05.841
But now I'm just a single mother.

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:06.941
My name is Anita.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.540
Like pizza. And this is the shit I eat now.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.220
Used to be home cooked foods. Bread.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.640
Delicious home cooked bread.

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.621
And now I spend my time hanging out with friends.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.760
Building deeper relationships with my kids.

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:23.961
I don't even care what men think about me anymore.

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:25.721
I have a mind of my own.

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:28.301
I think I have opinions.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.520
If you stay focused on just your husband,

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:33.001
I'm sure you'll do better than I did.

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.223
Stay tuned for the next lesson.
