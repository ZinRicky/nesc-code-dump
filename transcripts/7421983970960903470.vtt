00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.000
Fall and winter are basically non existent where I live

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.681
in Southwest Florida, so I am very,

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:09.121
very picky about the clothes I purchased for cold weather season

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:10.041
because I only get to pick,

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:13.041
like, one or two things because I just don't wear a whole lot.

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:17.361
And I saw this real life fleece shirt from Outdoor Nation,

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:19.121
and I knew I had to have it.

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:20.681
It is a microfiber fleece.

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:22.801
It's really warm. This is gonna be, like,

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:26.841
my only staple item that I wear all fall and winter long.

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.281
It has snaps, so, like,

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:30.041
if you live in the cold weather,

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:31.921
you can easily layer this,

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:34.081
but I can wear it as, like,

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:37.761
my outer layer jacket. Super comfy,

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:40.001
super cozy. For me,

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.861
this is a size small. It has nice coverage.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.960
It has these pockets, and everything is snaps,

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:50.281
which I really, really like because sometimes zippers get stuck.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:51.801
This is a really cute piece.

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:54.541
You can layer it or wear it as another jacket.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.160
Super, super comfy.

00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:59.980
And I cannot wait for our cool days that we do get to rock this.
