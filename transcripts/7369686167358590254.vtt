00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
I couldn't stop thinking about sticky chicken tenders all day long,

00:03.401 --> 00:06.821
and even though it was way too late to be in the kitchen cooking,

00:06.960 --> 00:08.640
I just couldn't stop thinking about it.

00:08.641 --> 00:10.161
So I decided to make it.

00:10.162 --> 00:12.481
I started off by making my own hot sauce

00:12.482 --> 00:14.321
by combining some Fresno chilies,

00:14.322 --> 00:15.361
garlic, peppercorn,

00:15.362 --> 00:16.361
some white vinegar,

00:16.362 --> 00:19.881
and letting that simmer on the stove until the chilies got soft.

00:19.882 --> 00:21.521
While that was simmering on the stove,

00:21.522 --> 00:23.681
I wanted something fresh to go with it,

00:23.682 --> 00:26.241
so I made a Brussels sprout and apple slaw.

00:26.242 --> 00:28.281
I thinly sliced my Brussels sprouts,

00:28.282 --> 00:30.161
cut my apples into matchsticks,

00:30.162 --> 00:32.541
made a quick Dijon mustard vinaigrette,

00:32.600 --> 00:33.760
combine some mustard,

00:33.761 --> 00:34.781
red wine vinegar,

00:34.880 --> 00:35.840
olive oil, salt,

00:35.841 --> 00:38.161
pepper, and then dressed my salad with it.

00:38.162 --> 00:40.081
I love crispy onions on salad,

00:40.082 --> 00:43.361
so I obviously had to top my slaw with that as well.

00:43.362 --> 00:44.441
I set that aside

00:44.442 --> 00:47.701
and moved on to making the breading for my chicken tenders.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.040
Cracked open some eggs,

00:49.041 --> 00:53.141
season my flour and panko bread crumbs before dipping my chicken,

00:53.160 --> 00:53.680
then the flour,

00:53.681 --> 00:54.401
then the eggs,

00:54.402 --> 00:55.161
then the bread crumbs,

00:55.162 --> 00:57.761
and repeating that before popping that in the oven.

00:57.762 --> 00:59.361
By this time, my peppers were soft,

00:59.362 --> 01:02.401
so I blended them up and then pass them through a strainer,

01:02.402 --> 01:04.181
and our hot sauce was done.

01:04.320 --> 01:05.200
My sticky sauce.

01:05.201 --> 01:06.561
I combined some butter,

01:06.562 --> 01:07.361
the hot sauce,

01:07.362 --> 01:08.241
some brown sugar,

01:08.242 --> 01:11.321
and let that reduce on the stove until it thickened

01:11.322 --> 01:14.201
and I pulled out my chicken drenched in My sauce.

01:14.202 --> 01:15.961
And it was time to plate.

01:15.962 --> 01:18.761
Put my chicken tenders down alongside my slaw.

01:18.762 --> 01:20.226
And this was so good.
