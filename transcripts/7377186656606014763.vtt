00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.760
that trad wife to single mom in your 40s pipeline

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:05.380
yes that's being exposed

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.740
I am one of those 41 year old single mom to 4 kids that was once a trad wife

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.840
uh for 10 years

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:18.460
and now I'm one of those out here trying to get everybody to listen to me

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.340
warning them about what that lifestyle is like

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.000
the only correction I would say is not all of us get left

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.880
I am a single mom by choice

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:30.840
I realized what was happening because when you're in it

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:31.920
you can sense it

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:33.920
it's fun for the first couple of years

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:35.360
search cute oh yeah

00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:36.200
the first few kids

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:42.040
but once real life gets at you and day to day is not Pinterest and you know

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.820
kids do a lot more crying than they do snuggling

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.640
and you realise how lonely it is and then you start to feel like a prop

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:52.900
like I feel like every woman knows the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.420
the levels of feelings that you go through

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.520
not all of us just sit around and wait to get left

00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:01.920
I did not single mom by choice

00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:04.520
I left I looked at my situation

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:05.440
I saw okay

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:06.560
I see what we did here

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:07.920
I see okay

00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.920
okay slick move with the four kids here cause you think I'm stuck

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:12.920
I get it I get it

00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:15.200
one of them is even disabled Whoo

00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:16.140
okay

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.460
how am I gonna do this

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.320
I managed to move me thousands of miles away

00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:23.400
from family so I'm alone

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.340
four kids one is disabled

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.360
cute you know

00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:29.880
real cute position to be in

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.120
I didn't stay

00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:32.120
I still was like

00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:37.120
fuck this I don't care what is on the other side of this

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:39.740
I'm jumping cause I'm not gonna stay in this shit

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.440
not all of us get left

00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:44.480
and I just want that to be represented in the conversation

00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:46.360
because any woman that's in the position

00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:47.740
I want her to know

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.720
I want other women who are in it

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:52.240
who are feeling those feelings

00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:55.460
who know what I'm talking about to say

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.520
oh fuck if she could do it

00:01:57.521 --> 00:01:58.520
maybe I could do it

00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:00.380
because absolutely you can

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.960
so just wanted to bring that into the conversation

00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:05.200
not all of us get left

00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:07.940
some of us are single mom by choice
