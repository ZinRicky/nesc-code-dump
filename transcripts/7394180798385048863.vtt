00:00.040 --> 00:03.000
No, a Kamala Harris presidency would not be a victory for all women.

00:03.001 --> 00:05.561
For so long, women have been coerced into thinking that

00:05.562 --> 00:07.361
if there is a woman in power,

00:07.362 --> 00:10.181
we need to support her, regardless of where she stands on policy,

00:10.240 --> 00:12.040
regardless of what we even think of her.

00:12.041 --> 00:13.921
It doesn't matter. She shares a gender with us,

00:13.922 --> 00:15.521
so we need to have her back.

00:15.522 --> 00:17.441
Truth be told, I think one of the most sexist,

00:17.442 --> 00:19.921
misogynistic mentalities you can have about women

00:19.922 --> 00:20.961
is that they are all the same

00:20.962 --> 00:22.241
and they all need to think the same.

00:22.242 --> 00:24.241
There's nothing empowering about feeling coerced

00:24.242 --> 00:27.081
into celebrating a woman in a position of power,

00:27.082 --> 00:29.681
regardless of where she stands on policy,

00:29.682 --> 00:31.201
simply because of her gender.

00:31.202 --> 00:33.441
There's nothing empowering about letting somebody's gender

00:33.442 --> 00:35.081
override their personal character.

00:35.082 --> 00:36.281
And truth be told, right now,

00:36.282 --> 00:39.841
this country is right for any woman who wants to lead to do so.

00:39.842 --> 00:41.161
We do not need to settle for

00:41.162 --> 00:44.681
and rely upon women with whom we fundamentally disagree

00:44.682 --> 00:46.641
to shatter glass ceilings for us.

00:46.642 --> 00:47.161
A true,

00:47.162 --> 00:50.521
genuine win is not if somebody with your same gender gets into power.

00:50.522 --> 00:53.241
If somebody with your same values gets into power,

00:53.242 --> 00:56.041
that is a win. So for millions of women across the country,

00:56.042 --> 00:58.961
we do not share the same values as Kamala Harris.

00:58.962 --> 01:01.081
We do not believe that she represents us.

01:01.082 --> 01:03.533
We share a gender, sure, but that's about it.
