00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.260
let's be clear abortion bans increase both the maternity mortality rate

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.240
and the infant mortality rate

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:09.920
and they do that without even meeting their purported policy end goal

00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:12.840
which is to decrease the number of abortions

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:14.000
none of this is new research

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.000
like decades of research across culture

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.120
geography and time have demonstrated the same thing

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:21.240
Republicans know this and they don't care

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:25.000
because it's not actually about reducing the abortion rate

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:25.960
if it was

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:29.780
you would do meaningful things that actually do meet that policy and goal

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.620
like education and access to contraception

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.320
both of which they are also actively attacking

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:39.080
they claim to be very haunted by abortions that occur later in a pregnancy

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:42.400
yet they are completely responsible for putting in all of the restrictions

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:46.580
that delay women's access to getting an abortion earlier in her pregnancy

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.920
like imposing literal waiting periods or requiring multiple in person

00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:52.840
unnecessary appointments again

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:55.600
it's not about saving babies

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:57.440
saving children women's healthcare

00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:59.880
any of that it's about controlling women

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.860
it's about controlling reproduction and sustaining a patriarchy

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.420
and punishing women who freely engage in their own pleasure

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.500
yes I am wearing an a for abortion

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.480
vote like your life depends on it

00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:14.940
because for many of us it literally does
