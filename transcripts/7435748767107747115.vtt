00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
misogyny is not “hating women”

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.640
that's a completely useless definition that's actually counterproductive

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:09.280
and all it does is help sustain the patriarchy

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:12.540
let me explain describing misogyny as hating women

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.000
eliminates our ability to actually diagnose anything that we see in front of us

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.360
as being misogynistic for a few different reasons

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:21.000
let's use Donald Trump as an example

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.040
so if you say Donald Trump is a misogynist

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:25.080
first of all you can't get inside his head

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:28.600
how are you going to prove that internally he hates women

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:31.060
second there are women that he loves

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.600
he loves manga women he probably loves his wife

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.480
he loves women who he's attracted to

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.440
he loves women who help him further his goals

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:40.400
and he just generally

00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:45.360
loves women who behave accordingly to gendered and societal role misogyny

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.320
and all this is Kate Mannes’ Down Girl

00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:48.240
which I highly recommend

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.400
is more productively understood as a political phenomenon

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:55.720
it should be understood as a system that operates within a patriarchal

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:57.000
social order

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:03.800
to police and enforce women's subordination and to uphold male dominance

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:06.080
it's a system that is policing people

00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:09.520
into behaving within their gendered norms and expectations

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:13.560
and it's policing people to continue to uphold the patriarchy

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:15.240
misogynist can love their mothers

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.880
not to mention their sisters daughters

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:17.920
wives girlfriends

00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:21.360
secretaries they need not hate women universally

00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:26.160
or even very generally they tend to hate women who are outspoken

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:27.680
action was all about misogyny

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:30.040
and that doesn't mean that people went into the voting booth thinking

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:31.300
I hate women

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.440
what it was is that this election was policing people's gender norms

00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:37.160
it was ensuring that um

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:39.240
trans individuals can't get healthcare

00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:44.280
ensuring that women across the United States perform reproductive duties about

00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:47.920
um making sure that a woman didn't have authority over men

00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:48.960
so much more um

00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:52.660
I have so much to say about this topic because this is such an incredible book

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.900
I am the feminist lawyer follow me if you enjoy being miserable
