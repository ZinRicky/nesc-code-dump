We actually have some very exciting news that we just got in the mail.

00:08.401 --> 00:10.941
So we've been working on a protein powder,

00:11.280 --> 00:15.180
and we just got the first

00:16.480 --> 00:21.040
full bag in the mail with the packaging,

00:21.041 --> 00:22.941
everything, and I am like,

00:23.040 --> 00:25.560
I'm having a moment. It's so exciting.

00:25.561 --> 00:29.081
You know, anybody who's followed me for some time

00:29.082 --> 00:30.721
knows that one of our favorite things to do

00:30.722 --> 00:35.281
is to put maple syrup, little bit of cinnamon in a glass jar,

00:35.282 --> 00:36.481
and then when we go milk the cow,

00:36.482 --> 00:37.081
we just, like,

00:37.082 --> 00:40.981
squirt the milk into it, and it makes, like, the most delicious

00:42.560 --> 00:46.080
drink. That's the first flavor that's gonna go out

00:46.081 --> 00:52.561
is our Maple cinnamon protein powder that's made with, um,

00:52.562 --> 00:55.361
colostrum. Because that's another thing that I just love,

00:55.362 --> 00:56.501
is that, like,

00:56.760 --> 01:00.380
amazing colostrum. The first few days of lactation,

01:09.400 --> 01:11.500
they just put a little lid or.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.540
AMA ağzım Soyuyo.

01:18.760 --> 01:19.560
Hmm.
