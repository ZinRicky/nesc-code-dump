00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.940
it's spooky home school season

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.300
and today we're working on a geology unit study

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.680
to make this unit study even more interesting

00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:08.640
I'm gonna use a Declan's mining bucket

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.280
these things are so freaking cool

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:11.800
my kids absolutely love them

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:13.360
this one is their raw rocks bucket

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:15.720
and I think this one might be my favourite cause it's just so basic

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.960
and it's perfect for this geology lesson

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:20.160
my son is so excited for this lesson today

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.080
also check out their store

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:23.640
because they have some really cute Halloween buckets right now

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:25.260
and I still wish I got one of those instead

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.200
all their buckets come with their own field guide

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:29.120
and this is so cute they're a family company

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:30.560
I love support in this company

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:31.600
love their buckets

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.840
if you have a kid that is into geology right now or just loves rocks

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:36.880
I would highly suggest this for a birthday or Christmas present

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:40.780
