A couple of weeks ago, we had a reporter come into our home

00:05.240 --> 00:07.740
to learn more about our family and business.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.460
We thought the interview went really well,

00:10.720 --> 00:14.300
very similar to the dozens of interviews we had done in recent memory.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.280
We were taken back, however,

00:17.281 --> 00:19.221
when we saw the printed article,

00:19.360 --> 00:22.220
which shocked us and shocked the world

00:22.280 --> 00:25.580
by being an attack on our family and my marriage,

00:26.200 --> 00:30.060
portraying me as oppressed with my husband being the culprit.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.140
This couldn't be further from the truth.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.600
Nothing we said in the interview implied this conclusion,

00:36.601 --> 00:40.261
which leads me to believe the angle taken was predetermined.

00:40.800 --> 00:45.220
For Daniel and I, our priority in life is god and family.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.420
Everything else comes second.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.040
The greatest day of my life was when Daniel and I were married

00:51.041 --> 00:52.421
13 years ago.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.540
Together, we have built a business from scratch.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.300
We've brought eight children into this world

00:58.480 --> 01:01.940
and have prioritized our marriage all along the way.

01:02.160 --> 01:05.200
We are co parents, co CEOs,

01:05.201 --> 01:07.081
co diaper changers, kitchen cleaners,

01:07.082 --> 01:09.861
and decision makers. We are one,

01:10.120 --> 01:13.820
and I love him more today than I did 13 years ago.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.840
We have many dreams still to accomplish.

01:16.841 --> 01:18.321
We aren't done having babies.

01:18.322 --> 01:20.561
We are excited for our new farm store to open,

01:20.562 --> 01:23.621
and I can't wait to see what the future holds for the rest of it.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.840
But for now, I'm doing what I love most

01:25.841 --> 01:28.001
being a mother, wife,

01:28.002 --> 01:29.441
a businesswoman, a farmer,

01:29.442 --> 01:32.701
a lover of Jesus, and making Meals from scratch
