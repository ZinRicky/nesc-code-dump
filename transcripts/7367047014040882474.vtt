00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
Two girls have dropped out,

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:04.441
and we need to replace them and replace them fast.

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:05.781
Hello. Hello.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.720
This video is for Riley and Rhonda only.

00:00:08.721 --> 00:00:10.161
If you're not Riley or Rhonda,

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:11.701
you can just keep scrolling.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.920
But I have a person that I think would be perfect for this.

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:17.761
Perfect for this.

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:19.561
This is my beautiful friend Devin.

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:21.121
She is in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:22.601
She's a wedding photographer.

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.921
She is literally one of the most joyful,

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:27.761
kind people you could ever meet.

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:29.961
I've been friends with her for several years now,

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.721
and one thing that I love about Devin

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:34.101
is that she's the friend that you wanna call

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.560
if you're going through something.

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:37.821
And she's always so encouraging,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.960
so joyful. She has this incredible relationship with Jesus,

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:41.721
and

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:45.041
her love for the Lord just shines through in all of her relationships.

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:49.081
And I have seen her generosity and her kindness over and over again.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.841
Not only is Devin a wedding photographer,

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:54.921
but she also does all different kinds of photography.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.921
Last year, my husband and I went to Paris,

00:00:56.922 --> 00:01:00.401
and she came with us along with my other friend, hope,

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:02.601
and we just had the best time.

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:05.801
I have traveled all over the place with this girl,

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:09.121
and I have seen really crazy things happen to us,

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:11.921
and her still have the most positive,

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:14.121
kind attitude about the things that are happening.

00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:16.281
She's very authentic to who she is,

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:19.321
and anytime you leave from hanging out with her,

00:01:19.322 --> 00:01:22.961
you just feel Lighter because of how much joy she has

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:24.701
that I believe comes from the Lord.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.680
So, Riley and Rhonda,

00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:27.521
I definitely think you should give her a shot.

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:28.881
And if you have any questions,

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:30.841
feel free to personally message me,

00:01:30.842 --> 00:01:32.801
and I will give you all the information

00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:34.861
you could possibly want on Devon.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.342
But give her a chance.
