00:00.080 --> 00:01.640
Has to be embarrassing for their husbands

00:01.641 --> 00:03.081
when they take them to work parties.

00:03.082 --> 00:05.201
All the educated women having conversations,

00:05.202 --> 00:07.741
while all she knows is stain removal from laundry.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.440
Yep, that's us.

00:09.441 --> 00:10.641
We don't really do anything.

00:10.642 --> 00:12.721
Unless you count cooking, cleaning,

00:12.722 --> 00:13.721
homeschooling our children,

00:13.722 --> 00:15.241
coaching our kids, sports teams.

00:15.242 --> 00:17.281
Using our own bodies to create,

00:17.282 --> 00:19.041
grow, and feed babies.

00:19.042 --> 00:20.561
Creating and maintaining a home,

00:20.562 --> 00:23.001
overseeing the physical, emotional,

00:23.002 --> 00:24.961
psychological well being of children.

00:24.962 --> 00:27.441
Being on call for them 24 hours a day,

00:27.442 --> 00:30.521
seven days a week, and just keeping them alive every single day.

00:30.522 --> 00:31.921
Like, if you set those things aside,

00:31.922 --> 00:35.321
we do nothing. And what's ironic is that if you ask these exact people,

00:35.322 --> 00:38.421
do you value the profession of house cleaner,

00:38.440 --> 00:39.480
cook, teacher,

00:39.481 --> 00:41.161
party planner, chauffeur,

00:41.162 --> 00:42.641
interior decorator, nurse,

00:42.642 --> 00:44.001
psychiatrist, mediator?

00:44.002 --> 00:44.961
They would all say, yes.

00:44.962 --> 00:48.961
Of course. The work that those people do is important to our world,

00:48.962 --> 00:52.401
to our society. But when they see a woman doing all of those things,

00:52.402 --> 00:55.161
and not for a paycheck, but just because she wants to,

00:55.162 --> 00:57.161
she's actually not doing anything at all.

00:57.162 --> 00:59.201
Stay at home moms know that they'll be looked down on.

00:59.202 --> 01:00.961
We know that what we do isn't making money.

01:00.962 --> 01:03.581
But we also know that some of the most valuable,

01:03.800 --> 01:06.440
impactful work in this world isn't paid.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.810
And we also know how to remove stains from laundry. Yes.
