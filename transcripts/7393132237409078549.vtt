00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
I'm a stay at home work from home mum

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:03.440
and one of my favourite ways to start

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:05.840
the day is by setting a bit of a vibe in the house

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:08.560
we live in an almost 70 year old mid century home

00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:10.640
and some rooms are naturally quite dark

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.280
so I like to pop some soft lighting on

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:14.660
maybe a record and choose a piece of art for the TV

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.680
cause she's an older home

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.000
she does seem to get a bit cold

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.120
so Iâ€™ll run the heat pump at least once a day

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:20.635
and clean up any crumbs that I find 

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:22.150
left behind from the kids breakfast 

00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:23.160
at this point of the day

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:24.680
it's usually time for my second coffee

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:27.200
to fix myself some breakfast and sit down to my admin

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:29.960
I've been a customer of Powershop since we lived in our first house

00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:31.320
six or seven years ago now

00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:34.160
and part of my weekly admin routine is to play the Power Game

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:35.920
I think I have an app for pretty much everything

00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:37.480
but this one is doing the most

00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:39.800
because it allows me to take control of my power

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:41.240
and understand what we're using

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.920
month by month day by day or even hour by hour

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:46.480
there's five of us in this house and despite my best efforts

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:48.520
I would say we are a high use power family

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:51.040
so I find it extremely helpful to be able to browse the shop

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:52.600
and save money on Powerpacks

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:54.080
which are discounted packs of power

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:55.720
I can also pick up a Future Pack

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:59.000
so that's buying power at a discounted rate for months still yet to come

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:02.640
I really enjoy buying my power weekly because it keeps me mindful of our usage

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.040
and it means that I get stung with a big bill at the end of the month

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:06.240
and every time I open the app

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:07.440
it tells me how much I've saved

00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.120
which motivates me to save even more

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:10.600
and if you're thinking about making the switch

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:14.240
Check my link below and you'll save $150 off your first 12 months

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.518
and it's basically girl math
