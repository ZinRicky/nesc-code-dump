00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.840
Like clockwork.

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:05.281
As soon as the relationship starts taking a dive,

00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:08.841
what happens? They're expecting their first child.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:12.121
This toxic little prick knows that.

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:13.601
She's getting wise to his shit.

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:17.161
He already tried the religion spin and committed

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:18.401
we can't get a divorce.

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:19.561
God, sins,

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:20.881
blah blah, blah.

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:21.921
That didn't work.

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:23.941
She was probably still considering divorce.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.620
And now they're having a baby.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.360
Awesome. Guarantee they're gonna be divorced in three years.

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:35.521
She's gonna be a happy little single mom to a two year old baby.

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:38.501
Guaranteed. You fucking Mark my words.
