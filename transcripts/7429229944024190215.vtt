00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.840
boyfriend thinks I'm punching

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:04.520
so need you to clear that one up

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:09.220
another episode of why men should not be allowed podcasts

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.460
bro who looks like a toe actually thinks that his gorgeous

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.020
stunning girlfriend is punching and tells her that firstly

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.040
huge red flag and should never think he's better than you

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:25.040
should always think that you're hotter than him

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:31.220
should always be begging for you and your divine Supreme goddessness

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.520
unacceptable are you dating a man who thinks he's hotter than you

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:43.140
uh it's a red flag because he is telling you you're punching to keep you down

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.660
to hold you back

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.960
to project his own insecurities onto you

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:53.500
so you think this is the best he's ever gonna get

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.780
he gets the upper hand you don't leave

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.700
he gets control podcast bros enabling each other

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.060
this goes back to the point

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.080
men protect other men men like this protect other men like this

00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:12.080
they're all ugly they're ugly cause their personalities are poo 

00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:16.800
their judgement is poor and their intelligence is sub par

00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:21.280
these podcast bros are wrong and wrong

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:25.360
I'm pretty sure that they think they're giving this one to him

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:28.680
they've declared he is better looking than his girlfriend

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:32.980
which is objectively untrue

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.260
firstly because beauty is objective

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.140
secondly because it's untrue

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.020
I don't care

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.000
she's just she's just more gorgeous than he will ever be

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:53.220
I'm pretty sure that her weight has something to do with their judgement

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.560
which is disgusting fatphobic

00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:58.980
gross objectifying she is stunning

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.840
he is below average secondly

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:03.880
why do you have a podcast where you're just like

00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:05.280
propping up gross men

00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:08.520
who are making gross judgement about their gorgeous girlfriends

00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:09.520
I don't know why I said secondly

00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:10.960
cause I've got a lot of different points to make

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:12.240
and I don't know which one I'm up to

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:15.160
I'm very annoyed what these men are actually doing here though

00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:17.540
I wanna get serious is they're protecting patriarchy

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.500
they're simping for patriarchy

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.600
they're protecting the patriarch

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:24.460
they'll say they're protecting women

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.360
like not in this context but they will go away and they'll be like

00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:29.900
these are kinda men that will be like

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.060
I protect women I love women

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.560
I love and respect women

00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:37.700
I have a mother and I've always loved women ever since I had a mother

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.180
protect the women no

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.860
cause at the first chance you get

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.380
here is a woman who is asking for your help and support

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.460
because she knows the patriarchy

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.280
she's been defiled by the patriarchy

00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:53.520
and she wants to seek assurance from the patriarchy to get it

00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:55.060
which is another conversation

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.020
speaking that this guy is not only ugly but a red flag

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.100
and they're deciding to side with him

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.300
you hate women and you relish the opportunity

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.860
you relish the opportunity

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.260
men as the objective gaze 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.960
men as the objective answer for the objective truth on whether I'm good enough

00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:19.460
whether I'm beautiful no

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.440
men pretending that they're looking at this with any ounce of rationality

00:03:22.441 --> 00:03:27.400
no they are simping for the patriarchy

00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:32.160
they are approving his message girls

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:33.960
if your boyfriend says shit like this

00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:36.900
don't go to other men for their opinion

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.800
because if they're not gonna give it to you

00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:44.320
they are looking for approval from other men and other men only

00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:46.740
they do not care about your approval

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.760
and if they get to say that he is punching

00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:54.160
which that she is punching and he is he is the hotter one

00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:57.620
then they also get to be the hotter one all the time

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.900
because they're all ugly and mean and have poo personalities

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.300
and they need other men 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.360
to approve of that so that they can keep getting away with dating beautiful

00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:11.820
gorgeous stunning smart

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.780
courageous bold

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.620
loyal friendly

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.040
funny women they maintain the status quo this way

00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:21.280
that's how they do it that's how they get off

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:25.580
they get to maintain an illusion by setting a standard that's false

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.660
they present as true and it is false

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.620
they set a standard they set an expectation

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.920
men have been doing it for time

00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:39.180
memorial for each other intergenerationally setting a low standard

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.240
so that they can all keep getting away with it

00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:45.220
they exploit us they want us to keep thinking that we're shit

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.820
they want us to keep thinking that we're not as hot as them

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.400
they don't want us to find our divine beauty within blah

00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:50.800
blah blah

00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:54.000
they want us to keep thinking we owe them something

00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:56.000
cause if we find our true power

00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:57.700
we understand it we know it

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.380
we work it we're no longer as useful to them

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.380
so this my friends

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.980
is patriarchy upholding patriarchy in action stay safe
