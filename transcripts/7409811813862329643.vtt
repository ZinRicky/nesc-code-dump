00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
We're moving again. We hopped on a flight to Connecticut

00:03.161 --> 00:05.401
to go house hunting for the next few days,

00:05.402 --> 00:07.081
and even though Texas was fun,

00:07.082 --> 00:09.361
it's just not where we wanna be long term.

00:09.362 --> 00:12.081
We want a slower life, being in a more quiet area,

00:12.082 --> 00:16.101
having more space, being able to get some chickens and start gardening.

00:16.239 --> 00:20.080
But also being closer to a bigger city for all the work that we do.

00:20.081 --> 00:23.881
And also being closer to Europe because my parents live out there.

00:23.882 --> 00:27.441
We've looked at six houses so far and have a favorite house.

00:27.442 --> 00:28.441
This one wasn't it.

00:28.442 --> 00:31.661
Even though lucky loved all the frogs that were on the property.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.160
Even though the view was stunning,

00:33.161 --> 00:35.481
this felt more like a vacation rental to us.

00:35.482 --> 00:38.321
So we decided to take a break and grab some lunch

00:38.322 --> 00:41.321
before heading over to the second house that we wanted to see.

00:41.322 --> 00:43.161
Since we're so picky with our houses,

00:43.162 --> 00:46.721
we knew we were gonna buy a house that we'd have to renovate anyways,

00:46.722 --> 00:48.561
so we're looking for a good layout,

00:48.562 --> 00:51.821
but also just that feeling of knowing that this is our home.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.120
House was so cute. I absolutely love the indoor pool.

00:55.121 --> 00:57.681
There was plenty of space to garden in the back

00:57.682 --> 00:59.241
and put in a basketball court

00:59.242 --> 01:01.241
since that's one of Lucky's priorities.

01:01.242 --> 01:04.641
I love a historical home. Even though I adored this house,

01:04.642 --> 01:07.121
we were just too tall to make this work.

01:07.122 --> 01:08.841
We have a few more houses to see.

01:08.842 --> 01:10.195
Before making our decision
