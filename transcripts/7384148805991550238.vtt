00:00.000 --> 00:02.140
Okay, let's do one of these, like,

00:02.240 --> 00:05.260
things as a mom that I just don't really care about.

00:06.280 --> 00:10.340
So while I get ready. So let's start.

00:10.480 --> 00:17.680
Number one for me is I don't really care if my kid gets dirty outside.

00:17.681 --> 00:20.521
Playing outside, I don't really care.

00:20.522 --> 00:22.761
Um, I. Again,

00:22.762 --> 00:24.961
I don't know. It's not really a big deal to me.

00:24.962 --> 00:28.501
I save the nose for the things that actually matter.

00:28.920 --> 00:32.020
Not for if they get dirty muddy.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.860
I actually encourage that.

00:33.960 --> 00:34.840
Um, and I.

00:34.841 --> 00:38.501
I would much rather my kid be dirty from playing outside

00:38.880 --> 00:41.820
then all clean from, um,

00:42.360 --> 00:44.520
all clean from being inside all day.

00:44.521 --> 00:50.401
So this one kind of ties in with the first one.

00:50.402 --> 00:56.801
But I do not care if my kid gets her clothes full of stains.

00:56.802 --> 00:58.641
I don't care from eating or whatever.

00:58.642 --> 01:01.061
I don't care. I will clean it later.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.600
There's a washing machine.

01:02.601 --> 01:04.281
I have a stain remover. Like,

01:04.282 --> 01:05.821
it's not the end of the world for me.

01:05.960 --> 01:09.300
And again, I save the nose for the things that actually matter.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.440
Third one is I don't really care for, like,

01:13.441 --> 01:15.281
a strict bedtime. Like,

01:15.282 --> 01:16.601
we sort of have, like,

01:16.602 --> 01:17.921
a rhythm, I would say,

01:17.922 --> 01:19.881
not a routine. Like, yeah,

01:19.882 --> 01:24.521
we do this, put on clothes, like, um,

01:24.522 --> 01:25.361
read books, like,

01:25.362 --> 01:28.481
whatever that is. But I don't have, like,

01:28.482 --> 01:30.781
you need to be in bed by this exact time.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.500
That's just not. Not me at all.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.840
I'm not crazy into that. And that's Just unrealistic,

01:36.841 --> 01:38.061
because, honestly,

01:38.280 --> 01:39.160
it's just

01:39.161 --> 01:42.181
everyone falls asleep when they feel like they need to fall asleep.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.880
Um, not saying that my kids.

01:43.881 --> 01:46.641
I'm gonna let my kids stay up until 3:00am if they wanted to,

01:46.642 --> 01:48.521
but I'm also not gonna be like, oh,

01:48.522 --> 01:50.901
you gotta be in bed at this time every day.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.500
Okay, this one, um,

01:53.760 --> 01:55.080
is. Might be a little controversial,

01:55.081 --> 01:58.161
but I. We do eat our nutrients,

01:58.162 --> 01:59.641
like, diet,

01:59.642 --> 02:00.321
and, like,

02:00.322 --> 02:02.281
all the foods in the. In our house are not.

02:02.282 --> 02:03.521
You guys, I don't buy, like,

02:03.522 --> 02:06.561
I honestly don't even really buy processed snacks,

02:06.562 --> 02:07.761
and when I do, it's all, like,

02:07.762 --> 02:09.341
organic and clean ingredients.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.960
Um, and it's usually for when we're on the go,

02:11.961 --> 02:13.281
not for when we're at home.

02:13.282 --> 02:15.921
Now we're at a birthday party or somewhere, like,

02:15.922 --> 02:17.781
similar to a birthday party setting,

02:17.920 --> 02:22.080
and there's a cake full of dyes, cupcakes,

02:22.081 --> 02:24.081
things like that. If my kid wants it,

02:24.082 --> 02:26.401
I'm gonna let her have it one day.

02:26.402 --> 02:28.261
It's really not gonna do anything for us.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.840
That's not like that every day,

02:29.841 --> 02:31.921
so it's not gonna do anything for us.

02:31.922 --> 02:35.181
I'm gonna let her have it and enjoy it while she's with the other kids,

02:35.240 --> 02:37.660
and it's not that big of a deal for me.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.920
This one also might be controversial,

02:39.921 --> 02:43.521
but I don't really care if meals aren't finished.

02:43.522 --> 02:44.321
Um,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.700
I'm not gonna serve something different,

02:46.800 --> 02:48.420
not gonna cook a whole different meal.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.640
But if you don't wanna finish your meal,

02:50.641 --> 02:53.621
And you're not hungry, that's totally okay with me.

02:53.760 --> 02:57.280
Um, we don't make meal time a big deal. Um,

02:57.281 --> 03:00.441
or like make a big fuss about not finishing a meal.

03:00.442 --> 03:03.261
Sometimes I don't finish my plate cause I'm just not hungry.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.140
So same thing applies for my child.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.760
This one might be a little bit unpopular,

03:09.761 --> 03:13.261
but I don't really care if, um,

03:13.880 --> 03:15.800
baths are longer. Like,

03:15.801 --> 03:18.601
if my daughter wants to take a longer bath,

03:18.602 --> 03:22.101
I don't really care. Sometimes I like to take a longer shower. Um,

03:22.440 --> 03:25.340
so I don't really care if she wants to take a 30 minute bath,

03:25.680 --> 03:27.780
go ahead, it's fine.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.420
I don't know, it's fine.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.440
And another one is

03:32.441 --> 03:36.681
I don't really care about not like a germophobic or whatever.

03:36.682 --> 03:37.521
Like, oh my god,

03:37.522 --> 03:39.961
you gotta wash your hands or you can't touch that

03:39.962 --> 03:42.461
or I'm not like that at all.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.220
Um, I don't really care

03:45.240 --> 03:48.480
if you touch something that you weren't supposed to touch,

03:48.481 --> 03:50.601
and it may be gross to some people,

03:50.602 --> 03:52.041
it's fine. Like,

03:52.042 --> 03:53.641
that's probably why my kid never gets sick,

03:53.642 --> 03:55.401
cause she's always touching things

03:55.402 --> 03:57.061
that she's not supposed to be touching.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.320
And I'm not like,

03:59.321 --> 04:02.041
you have to wash your hands three times and oh my gosh,

04:02.042 --> 04:03.401
you're like, I'm not like that.

04:03.402 --> 04:04.781
So, yeah.

04:04.920 --> 04:05.880
Okay, last one is,

04:05.881 --> 04:08.521
I don't really care if my kid makes a mess playing with her toys,

04:08.522 --> 04:11.241
as long as it gets picked up by the end of the day.

04:11.242 --> 04:12.701
I Don't really care.

04:13.280 --> 04:17.260
Don't really care. Go off with your toys while I.

04:17.320 --> 04:21.660
It allows me to cook, it allows me to clean and. Yeah.
