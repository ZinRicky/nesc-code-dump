00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.120
you should go to bed when your partner does

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:04.361
if you want a happy marriage or relationship

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:05.841
you should always remember that

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:09.241
going to bed together is one of the most important parts of the day

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.001
yes I know you're probably like ugh

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.180
but I'm not tired when they are,

00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:13.521
or they snore,

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:15.121
or I need to get X

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:17.021
y and Z done before bed

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.880
so many couples don't go to bed together

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:22.181
instead one will stay up to watch TV or get work done

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.440
often you'll find that couples that don't go to bed together

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.741
don't spend a lot of quality time together

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.620
theyâ€™re losing their connection or spark

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.160
which ends up leading to an unhappy marriage or relationship,

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:34.761
or even worse, divorce.

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:37.141
please make an effort to go to bed together,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.780
discuss your day together, cuddle,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.940
embrace each other with warmth!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.860
simply just spend the last moments of each day together if you want a happy

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.318
long lasting marriage/relationship
