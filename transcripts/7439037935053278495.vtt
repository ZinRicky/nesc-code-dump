00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Dave Grohl is no longer working with a divorce lawyer

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:07.001
and says he doesn't want to lose his family.

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:10.281
We gotta pull a few lessons from this whole Dave Grohl thing

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:12.721
now that we're seeing it play out all the way.

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:15.321
Number one, they come back.

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:17.281
Your baby daddy. They always come back.

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:21.161
Of course they come back. They didn't necessarily have a baby with you

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.281
because they wanted to love and grow their family.

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:25.881
They wanted to forever link themselves to you

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:27.841
so that they always have a foot in the door.

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:29.341
Hey, how's my kid?

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.360
Okay,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.800
so if you're worried if he's gonna come back,

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.041
he's probably gonna come back.

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:34.641
And, no,

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:35.601
you should not take him back.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.961
I don't think Dave Grohl's wife should take him back.

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:39.521
Absolutely not. No.

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:43.701
Because here's the thing. Once you've seen that level of cruelty,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.260
it doesn't matter how many apologies this person gives you,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.160
you can't ever unsee it. Like when someone shows you a picture,

00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:51.361
those fucking optical illusions,

00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:52.521
and you're like, is it a vase

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:54.041
or is it two faces kissing?

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:56.521
Well, you can always see both sides now.

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:59.421
You're always gonna be able to see it for both sides.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.820
So is the tarnish is there.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.500
No matter how sweet and wholesome,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.260
hmm, and talented and kind and genuine the guy may seem,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.160
he is still capable of being the kind of piece of shit

00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:19.241
that will go and cheat on you

00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:21.621
after 20 something years of dedication.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.720
And knock another woman up

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:25.441
and then lawyer up, like,

00:01:25.442 --> 00:01:28.201
protect himself before he's about to hurt you. Motherfucker.

00:01:28.202 --> 00:01:29.161
You hurt me in the cheating.

00:01:29.162 --> 00:01:30.481
You hurt me and having the baby.

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:31.681
You're hurting me in the divorce,

00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:33.361
and you're the one protecting yourself.

00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:35.401
Like I have any power to do anything to you.

00:01:35.402 --> 00:01:39.781
Like he is a cold, calculated piece of shit.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.320
So, you know,

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:44.641
just look at these stories and take the lessons

00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:46.501
and apply them into your own life.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.600
Never think you're so fucking unique,

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:50.441
it could never happen to you.

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:51.241
If it could happen to her,

00:01:51.242 --> 00:01:53.661
it could happen to you. If it could happen to me, it could happen to you.
