00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.080
Once I started looking into my childhood

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:03.241
and doing the healing work

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:06.661
of trying to repair myself and deal with generational traumas,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.480
I realized that a lot of my romantic relationships

00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:10.881
were extremely toxic.

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:15.861
And I was drawn to narcissists and trauma bond relationships.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.640
So when I saw this book, I went to TikTok Shop,

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:20.441
I immediately had to try and read it.

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:22.261
It is called Run Like Hell.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.600
It is by Nadine Mcelousso,

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:25.841
which, if you're not familiar,

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:27.721
is The Wolf of Wall Street,

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:29.381
ex wife, the Duchess.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.720
And what I liked about it the most

00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:32.721
is that it tells you all about why you kind of

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:35.321
enter into trauma bonds, what they look like,

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:37.201
how to identify if you're in one,

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:41.301
and how to heal from them and try and get away from, like,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.520
pathological romantic issues.

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.221
Finding these narcissists.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.080
I highly recommend the book to continue on your journey,

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.241
either whether you're single

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:52.081
or you just wanna kind of understand your romantic past.

00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:54.321
Because I know that I am now in a very happy,

00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:55.341
healthy relationship.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.040
But I had no idea why I was so drawn to these toxic,

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:02.481
narcissistic relationships before.

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:04.281
And this is a really good read.

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:06.041
You can find it in my TikTok shop,

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:07.941
or you can find it here on TikTok Shop.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.360
Um, Nadine is also on here.

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:12.641
Her page. I'll tag her and you can go see.

00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:15.581
She does great TikTok videos that have been really, really helpful.
