00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.400
Being a tried wife online is a really crazy thing

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:03.641
because you run across a lot of people

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:05.321
who don't understand having a set of values

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:07.121
that you make your life decisions from.

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:09.761
The people with the most opinions on what it means to be a tried wife

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:12.241
are not the people in the tried community,

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:14.501
but actually people who are completely opposite

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.800
and against what tried wives believe and stand for.

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.801
They have this limited, oppressed view of what it means to be trapped

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:21.401
and they try to put us in this box

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:23.901
when we break their made up stereotypes.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.080
They say, oh,

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:29.001
you aren't a tried wife as if they get to define who we are.

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.801
I have never had another tried wife say that

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:33.781
I'm not tried because I have a side hustle.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.880
But I have had many outside the community tell me that

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:40.081
being traditional is not a 1950s cosplay cult

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:42.381
or a Little House on the Prairie cosplay cult.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.600
Being traditional is having a set of values

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:46.761
that you make your life decisions from.

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:49.861
We all do this. It's called having a world view.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.480
Because I am a Christian, my set of values comes from the Bible.

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:55.721
I make my decisions based off what it says about me

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.521
and how to live my life. And because it's not a cult,

00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:01.281
another person can base their life decisions off the Bible

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:03.281
and have a completely different life.

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:05.240
For me, that's the beauty of it.

00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:07.161
No one Gets to define who I am,

00:01:07.162 --> 00:01:09.201
except for god. Not a community,

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.681
not strangers on the internet,

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:12.601
not an aesthetic that I'm obsessed with.

00:01:12.602 --> 00:01:15.081
Who I am comes from an understanding of the Bible.

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:18.821
Because if it starts coming from man made rules, it will become a cult.
