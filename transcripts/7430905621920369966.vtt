00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.120
I just saw a video from a creator I really like

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:05.641
talking about how annoyed she is by online feminists

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:09.341
who make disparaging remarks about being a stay at home mom.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.060
And she used the sort of indignation to talk to feminists

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.520
and say that feminism is just about supporting every woman's identity

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:19.241
and wholeness and choice,

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:22.961
whether that is somebody who gets an education or is a boss bitch

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:25.161
or decides to be a stay at home mom and homemaker

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:27.481
and just aspires to have children and be a wife.

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:29.761
And I first wanna validate people who feel this way.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.081
I have seen the rhetoric online

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:34.681
that extremely devalues the labor of mothers

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:36.881
and homemakers especially um.

00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:38.241
And it can feel really,

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:40.321
really frustrating and disappointing to see women trying

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:43.141
kind of tear each other down based on their lifestyle choices.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.640
However, I'm extremely critical of people who wanna push this idea

00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:48.761
that women have true choice in this country,

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:52.601
because what we have in America truly is the illusion of choice.

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:56.241
And I don't think that we are doing our younger sisters,

00:00:56.242 --> 00:00:58.301
our women who have yet to become mothers,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.620
any service

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.480
by alluding to the fact that this is a true and equitable choice,

00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:05.521
whether to work or to stay home with children.

00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:08.441
But I know a lot of women who have come to this lifestyle,

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:11.441
myself included, who now find great satisfaction in it,

00:01:11.442 --> 00:01:12.861
who came to this choice,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.300
this choice through economic or career inequality.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.440
We have not gone far enough in this country

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:22.001
in order to have this understanding that it is a true choice.

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:26.541
We have not gone far enough because we still don't have a true,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.080
equitable life for working women mothers.

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:34.041
We still don't have things like a reasonable maternal health system.

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:38.481
We don't have things like a reasonable length of a maternity leave.

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:40.561
We don't have things like subsidized child care.

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:43.041
We don't have things like programs that support young families.

00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:46.401
We don't have things like daycare in offices we don't even have.

00:01:46.402 --> 00:01:48.701
Or we are just starting to put in legislation

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.840
that secures and codifies a woman's right to have clean,

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:55.441
sanitary and private place to pump for her child.

00:01:55.442 --> 00:01:57.001
That just happened.

00:01:57.002 --> 00:02:00.901
Employers were still able to fire their pregnant employees.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.680
I have held enough hands of my crying friends

00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:06.961
to know that 12 weeks is not a reasonable amount of time

00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:10.161
for a new mother to spend with her infant child.

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:11.641
A great example of this is Germany

00:02:11.642 --> 00:02:13.401
that I know, I think has three years,

00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:16.961
which allows women to take that time necessary to spend

00:02:16.962 --> 00:02:19.841
to raise their child from infancy

00:02:19.842 --> 00:02:21.921
and still have an opportunity to go back to work

00:02:21.922 --> 00:02:23.281
when and if they are ready.

00:02:23.282 --> 00:02:25.921
And of course, not every woman is gonna Wanna do that.

00:02:25.922 --> 00:02:30.161
Some women are going to truly choose to stay home with her children.

00:02:30.162 --> 00:02:34.021
But doesn't that seem like more of an actual choice?

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.240
This country does not support Mothers or children.

00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:39.641
Because if they did, they would allow for that.

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:41.281
We would fund that.

00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:46.161
Because we all know that healthy mothers and children are together

00:02:46.162 --> 00:02:49.161
for at least the first year of that baby's life.

00:02:49.162 --> 00:02:53.041
In order to promote things like maternal bonding and breastfeeding.

00:02:53.042 --> 00:02:57.841
And in order to actually have healthy children and healthy mothers,

00:02:57.842 --> 00:03:00.661
we have to give them actual healthy choices.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.040
So when the criticism comes,

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:03.441
we get defensive. We say, no,

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:04.201
this is my choice.

00:03:04.202 --> 00:03:07.721
Because we have found satisfaction and love for the job that we do,

00:03:07.722 --> 00:03:09.641
and we value the labor that we do,

00:03:09.642 --> 00:03:11.001
and we should.

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:14.161
But the criticism doesn't come for the life that we're leading.

00:03:14.162 --> 00:03:17.561
It comes from the belief that we actually had a true

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:19.721
and valid and equitable choice.

00:03:19.722 --> 00:03:23.041
Because what we have really gotten is a piece of coal in a stocking,

00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:25.061
and we're calling it a Christmas present.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.520
Women in this country don't actually have a choice.

00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:31.441
What we have is a system that is gonna depend

00:03:31.442 --> 00:03:35.161
on so many of us not liking the choices we have

00:03:35.162 --> 00:03:36.721
and choosing to stay home

00:03:36.722 --> 00:03:39.201
because it is easier, it is more natural,

00:03:39.202 --> 00:03:41.601
and it is better for our children.

00:03:41.602 --> 00:03:43.861
Because women are the backbone,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.360
and the unpaid labor are the backbone of our economy.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:51.441
And if we gave women equitable choice,

00:03:51.442 --> 00:03:55.681
we would actually have to prioritize children and pay for that.

00:03:55.682 --> 00:03:58.761
It's not about whose identity is more valid.

00:03:58.762 --> 00:04:00.401
It is about setting up the Women

00:04:00.402 --> 00:04:02.841
who have not yet gotten to this phase of life

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:06.901
to realize that they are already in a losing position

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.480
because we have not given them what would be required

00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:12.601
to make an equitable choice

00:04:12.602 --> 00:04:15.461
to stay or not stay in the labor force.
