00:00.120 --> 00:02.040
Here are the best ways to land a quality man

00:02.040 --> 00:03.400
in the year 2024.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.640
If you hope to marry a quality man,

00:05.640 --> 00:07.280
you need to find one who is masculine.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.760
And if you want a masculine man,

00:08.760 --> 00:10.440
you need to be a feminine woman.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.600
In a world where women are taught to be loud

00:12.600 --> 00:13.840
and severe and harsh,

00:13.840 --> 00:16.440
it can be very difficult to unlearn those traits.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.440
But the beautiful thing about femininity

00:18.440 --> 00:20.160
is that it is in all of us.

00:20.160 --> 00:21.560
If you are a female,

00:21.560 --> 00:22.600
it is in your blood.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.320
You just need to shut off those layers

00:24.320 --> 00:26.160
that the world has put on you.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.320
And if you can pull it off,

00:27.320 --> 00:29.080
and if you can become a little bit softer

00:29.080 --> 00:30.280
and more nurturing,

00:30.280 --> 00:33.440
and really value and prioritize those things,

00:33.440 --> 00:34.400
you will stand out.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.100
The second thing is to expand your social circles.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.560
I think a lot of us mistaken having high standards

00:39.560 --> 00:41.880
with just being snooty and avoiding people.

00:41.880 --> 00:42.440
And I promise,

00:42.440 --> 00:44.560
if you walk around putting off that kind of energy,

00:44.560 --> 00:45.640
you are not going to find

00:45.640 --> 00:46.680
the man that you were looking for.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.580
You can have high standards up here.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.640
You need to treat everybody with respect.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.840
You need to go out of your way to get to know people,

00:52.840 --> 00:54.320
because they are worth getting to know,

00:54.320 --> 00:56.160
even if you don't wanna necessarily date them.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.440
Becoming friends with people,

00:57.440 --> 00:58.800
people you see at the gym everyday,

00:58.800 --> 01:00.080
people you see at the grocery store.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.120
Getting to Know their names and who they are

01:02.120 --> 01:03.640
will make you a better person

01:03.640 --> 01:05.080
and will give you more opportunities

01:05.080 --> 01:07.200
to meet the kind of man that you want to meet.

01:07.200 --> 01:07.680
A lot of times,

01:07.680 --> 01:09.040
we also make the mistake of thinking

01:09.040 --> 01:11.880
that god is just going to bring someone right to us,

01:11.880 --> 01:12.800
right to our front door.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.360
I found that he usually doesn't work that way.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.160
He usually nudges you to go

01:16.160 --> 01:17.440
get out of your comfort zone

01:17.440 --> 01:18.920
and go put yourself out there

01:18.920 --> 01:19.800
and be available

01:19.800 --> 01:21.500
and be open to his blessings.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.720
And that brings me to my third point,

01:22.720 --> 01:24.320
which is to involve god.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.680
And I'm not just talking to those of you

01:25.680 --> 01:26.640
who are super religious.

01:26.640 --> 01:27.800
I'm talking to anyone.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.320
God is available for anyone.

01:29.320 --> 01:30.760
No matter what you claim to believe,

01:30.760 --> 01:32.560
no matter how good you are at going to church

01:32.560 --> 01:33.200
or whatever,

01:33.200 --> 01:34.880
he's there, and he will listen to you

01:34.880 --> 01:35.960
and he will guide you.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.080
And that's the wonderful thing about him

01:37.080 --> 01:39.080
is that you do not need to have any prerequisites.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.440
You do not need to be any type of way to get his help.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.040
Talk to him

01:42.040 --> 01:44.160
and tell him about the kind of man you hope to find.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.400
Tell him about your struggles

01:45.400 --> 01:47.040
and how difficult it feels.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.480
Tell him all of these things.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.520
And while you're at it,

01:49.520 --> 01:51.000
pray for that guy who's out there.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.440
Pray for your future husband,

01:52.440 --> 01:53.680
who you believe you will find,

01:53.680 --> 01:54.800
because he is out there.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.800
Somewhere right now.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.440
Living life,

01:56.440 --> 01:57.280
going day to day,

01:57.280 --> 01:58.320
struggling, learning

01:58.320 --> 01:59.040
all those things.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.120
And I think praying for him

02:00.120 --> 02:01.863
is one of the greatest things you can do.
