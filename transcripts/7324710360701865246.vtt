00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.800
Do I, as a traditional wife,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.520
think women should work?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:03.920
Starting off,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.480
I don't think there's anything wrong with a woman

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.080
having a job.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.480
I know that might come as a shock

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.200
because people think.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.880
We think women can only stay home.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.000
I don't believe that.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.580
Um, I've never believed that.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.320
Do, however, think that being home is very important.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.520
Especially if you have young children in the home.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.480
Um, like toddlers and stuff.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.560
I don't think it's healthy

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.000
to have them in daycare all day.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.740
I think that they need to be with mom.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.520
But I also understand that, you know,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.120
it's not possible for everyone to be home.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.520
I totally fully grasp that.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.840
I think a woman's priority should be her home. So

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.560
if your job is pulling you too much away from the home

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.120
and the well being of your family,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.800
then I think that is a problem.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.920
But other than that, no,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.200
I think it's great if women work.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.280
If they wanna work, great.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.280
I personally do not want a 9 to 5.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.640
I really like staying home and being home

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.880
and doing the things that I do in my home.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.680
Um, but again,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.920
if women wanna make income to help their husbands,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.880
by all mean, do it.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.600
There's also ways you can do that from home.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.200
You just gotta get really creative today.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.280
Work is a good thing.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.640
Work is a part of being human.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.840
It gives you a purpose,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.320
it gives you an identity.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.560
And if that is better fulfilled for a woman,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.940
I guess outside of the homes,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.840
by all means,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.160
go for it. Um,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.000
but work outside the home is work,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.680
and work inside of the home is work.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.939
So they're both work.
