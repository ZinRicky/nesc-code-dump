00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.320
I literally don't understand people who don't

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.780
sing in their car,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.780
because that's all me and my mom did.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.440
I was like, you don't sing in your car?

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.340
Where do you sing? Where?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.260
Where do you belt it out?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.140
You know what I mean?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.320
I'm not gonna see any of these people.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.340
They're all passing by me. Sing it. Sing it. Fine.
