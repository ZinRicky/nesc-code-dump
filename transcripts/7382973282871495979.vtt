00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.640
I gave some advice as a mom of three to a friendly acquaintance last night

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:05.000
who had just had her second baby

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.160
and I thought that somebody else might need to hear it

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:10.240
we were having a conversation and she was talking about how she was doing

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:13.280
she had just welcomed her second son not too long ago

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:15.400
and you know how you can tell that somebody's like

00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:16.640
telling you that they're struggling

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:17.880
but they're not telling you in like

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:20.920
those words they're just asking the right kind of questions like

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:21.840
how did you do it

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:23.200
like does it get easier

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:24.480
um you know

00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:25.680
we've been coping

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.880
like those sorts of kind of

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:28.040
like veiled language

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:28.920
so I could tell like

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.920
she was having a hard time

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:30.560
and specifically

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.160
this is another person who does content

00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:33.000
like specifically like

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:34.040
super creative

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:35.360
like aesthetic

00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:39.160
beautiful content that obviously takes a lot of her time and editing and

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:42.940
and energy and I told her that it's just hard

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.880
I think so often

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.720
we try to pretend that everything is gonna be sunshine and rainbows and like

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.000
we've got this mama

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:51.400
you superhero what

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:52.480
yeah go girl

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:53.080
but in reality

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:53.920
when someone struggling

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:55.120
all they wanna know is that like

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.280
it's okay that they're struggling

00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:57.760
so I basically just told her

00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:59.320
I was like it is this hard

00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:00.760
it's super fucking hard

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.660
this is the chapter of hard

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.680
um but it's a temporary chapter

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:05.760
and it does get easier

00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:06.760
and you'll get through it

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:10.240
and if you need to take a step back from things that are draining your energy

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:11.920
or resources or time

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:15.120
think that's okay because you're now in a different chapter

00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:16.480
it doesn't mean you're always gonna be here

00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:20.040
but I think the best advice you can give to a new mom who either has one kid

00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:23.440
or two kids or is going through that transition and is having a tough time is

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:25.840
you're having a tough time because it is tough

00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:26.760
and the more you can like

00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:31.400
settle into the knowledge that it is hard and you're gonna struggle and

00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:33.260
and it it's okay

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
it's it's okay to be having a hard time when

00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.540
when something's hard

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.200
you have to like

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.340
surrender to the chapter that you're in

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.500
and look to your friends who have been through it

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.780
because we're testaments to the fact that you're gonna make it through it too
