00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
I couldn't decide whether I wanted something sweet

00:02.561 --> 00:05.361
or savoury for breakfast, and neither could my kids,

00:05.362 --> 00:08.041
so I decided to make a few different things.

00:08.042 --> 00:12.421
I started off by making some homemade pistachio cranberry granola.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.520
I mixed all of my ingredients together,

00:14.521 --> 00:16.881
popped in the oven, and while it was cooling,

00:16.882 --> 00:19.021
I sprinkled over some cranberries.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.600
There's something so special about a fresh pressed orange juice,

00:22.601 --> 00:25.121
so I obviously had to do that as well.

00:25.122 --> 00:26.881
And then for my savory options,

00:26.882 --> 00:30.341
I decided to do a hash with some bacon.

00:30.440 --> 00:34.740
I peeled and grated my potatoes before squeezing out all the liquid,

00:34.760 --> 00:37.600
and I seasoned them and gave that really good mix

00:37.601 --> 00:40.801
and fried them in the bacon fat that was left over

00:40.802 --> 00:42.521
after frying my bacon off.

00:42.522 --> 00:45.441
While my hash Browns were in the skillet getting crispy,

00:45.442 --> 00:49.341
I started making some waffles as my sweet component.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.120
I mixed all of my dry ingredients

00:51.121 --> 00:53.641
and then moved on to cracking some eggs,

00:53.642 --> 00:55.561
combining that with butter, vanilla,

00:55.562 --> 00:59.241
some milk, and pouring that into my dry ingredients.

00:59.242 --> 01:01.001
After that was all mixed up,

01:01.002 --> 01:05.781
I made my waffles and then moved on to a big fruit plate.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.280
When fruit is in season, it's so,

01:08.281 --> 01:12.201
so good to me, so I make sure to always buy things that are in season.

01:12.202 --> 01:16.401
I cut up some plums and some white peaches for plating them

01:16.402 --> 01:18.741
alongside some cherries, strawberries,

01:18.840 --> 01:21.400
blueberries, and then setting that aside

01:21.401 --> 01:23.961
while I started working on my vegetable plate,

01:23.962 --> 01:25.921
which Was some heirloom tomatoes,

01:25.922 --> 01:27.801
Persian cucumbers, red onions,

01:27.802 --> 01:31.841
some salmon and parsley. Lucky requested some scrambled eggs,

01:31.842 --> 01:33.361
so these were just for him.

01:33.362 --> 01:36.761
I made a chive and Parmesan scrambled egg.

01:36.762 --> 01:39.521
I don't know whether you call this a scrambled egg or not,

01:39.522 --> 01:41.701
but this is how I make him his eggs.

01:41.760 --> 01:44.080
I topped that with some more parmesan cheese,

01:44.081 --> 01:46.641
and then it was time to plate everything up.

01:46.642 --> 01:49.041
Everyone loved having these different options today,

01:49.042 --> 01:50.923
and it was absolutely divine.
