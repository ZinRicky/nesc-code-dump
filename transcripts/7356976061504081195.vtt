00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.760
So on Monday, on the day of the total solar eclipse,

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:04.161
my best friend, Tom Sweeney,

00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:07.181
here he is. As I was picking him up from the jail,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.780
he was arrested,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.760
obviously, and, um,

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.881
he's currently being charged with a Class B misdemeanor,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.181
disorderly conduct.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.480
Why was he arrested for disorderly conduct?

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:23.021
Allegedly, he was disrupting a university event by using a megaphone

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.560
as part of a pro Palestine protest that we were holding on Indiana

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.821
University's campus in Bloomington, Indiana.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.240
We were doing nothing illegal,

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:32.241
Sweeney said. In fact,

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:32.961
we were doing something

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:34.641
that most people in the crowd were very grateful

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:35.581
was being done.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.820
This is true. Um,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.040
we were shown a lot of support.

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:41.261
Indiana University really showed out for us.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.360
Number one, I should have the charges dropped regardless, without a fee,

00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:45.121
without hours,

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:46.561
because there was no crime committed,

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:47.841
Sweeney said. Second,

00:00:47.842 --> 00:00:50.601
the ability to have me with this charge lingering for so many months

00:00:50.602 --> 00:00:53.561
is a tactic to disincentivize me from participating

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:55.001
in any future speech activities

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:57.461
that may be disappointing to the university.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.080
This, to me,

00:00:58.081 --> 00:00:59.681
is why he was arrested in the first place.

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:00.281
I believe that

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:01.321
the Indiana University

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:03.801
Police Department simply wanted to make a statement.

00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:07.221
The university didn't wanna have their precious solar eclipse event

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.120
being eclipsed by our pro Palestine protest,

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:14.661
and they want to dissuade future protesters from participating.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.960
There's also this claim that Sweeney was interrupting a live concert

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:18.521
at Done Meadow

00:01:18.522 --> 00:01:19.801
by speaking into a Megaphone

00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:22.541
and was asked several times to stop before being arrested.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.800
This is simply not true.

00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.721
I was there myself to witness that

00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:28.841
he was not warned or asked to stop before being arrested.

00:01:28.842 --> 00:01:31.081
We were also in the opposite corner of Done Meadow

00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:33.001
from where this concert was taking place.

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:34.761
Um, the concert was taking place,

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:36.361
if you're familiar with Bloomington,

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.101
in the corner near Kirkwood and Indiana Avenue.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.520
We were in the direct opposite corner,

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.221
and we intentionally went there because it was quieter.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.880
Considering that Sweeney's only alleged crime is using a megaphone,

00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:51.261
I think any reasonable prosecutor is going to drop these charges.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.640
Frankly, it's embarrassing that IUPD even arrested him

00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.801
to try and make a statement and dissuade protesters from protesting.

00:01:56.802 --> 00:01:59.161
Because we're going to continue to resist.

00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:00.221
The university

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.260
is going to continue to see protest from students and alumni.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.880
If anything, this arrest is only strengthened our cause

00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:08.501
and strengthened our solidarity.
