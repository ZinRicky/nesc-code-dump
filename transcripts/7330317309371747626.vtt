00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
Your parents arranged your marriage

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.360
is what a lot of people tell me,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.800
but I actually

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.720
don't consider our marriage to have been arranged.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.320
Let me explain.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.520
Andrew and I did what is called a courtship,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.120
and courtship is

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.640
the process of getting to know each other

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.860
with marriage and mind.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.800
Essentially,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.340
we focused on learning about each other

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.180
but excluding emotions as much as possible.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.520
Emotions are not a bad thing,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.920
and by the time we were engaged,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.520
we were head over heels for each other.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.560
But the focus was on our compatibility,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.180
not our attraction to each other.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.280
The difference I see between courtship

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.500
and arranged marriages

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.060
is that we didn't know if we would get married,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.020
and we were totally fine with that.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.120
Which is why we try to keep our emotions

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.840
out of the picture

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.660
and get to know each other platonically.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.200
Good marriages, after all,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.960
are built on strong friendship.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.480
But if we were not compatible,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.760
we wanted to be able to break up

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.360
without breaking each other's hearts.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.720
Arranged marriages are usually where the parents

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.640
choose the spouses.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520
Sometimes the couple gets to know each other

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.400
before the wedding,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.940
and sometimes they meet at the altar.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.080
Well, I say that my dad found my husband for me,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.800
which he did.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.820
No one knew of Andrew would be my husband.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.000
He found a suitor,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.980
and that suitor became my husband.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.440
There's more I could go into,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.920
and if you're interested in learning more about

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.640
our Courtship

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.720
feel free to ask questions,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.749
and I'll try to dive deeper into the soon.
