00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I am gonna hold your fucking hand through starting a business

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.721
using some skill that you probably already have

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:08.981
and are a fucking expert at.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.600
Because you're a stay at home mom and all you do is like

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.801
shit that you could charge people for and charge a lot of money

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:19.021
and you can do it to fit your schedule and all that shit.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.880
So I'm about to get to work to continue working on all the.

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.361
The fucking course material.

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:27.881
I'm not. This is not something that I bought from somebody

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:29.081
and I'm just selling it to you.

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:30.961
I'm like literally making this shit,

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:35.261
not just by myself. My friend who actually owns a business,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.400
she has helped people earn millions of dollars in revenue

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:43.401
by running their ads. So it was the two of us together.

00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:45.361
We're both single moms, we both had four kids.

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:46.641
We just had so much in common

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:49.241
and it felt nice to do it together,

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:53.281
help lighten the load and help expand that what we can offer.

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:57.401
So because it's live, it's not, um,

00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:00.501
some made up shit like every fucking week on Thursday.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.480
If you're able to attend it live,

00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:04.761
we're gonna be live

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:08.661
and answering your questions and helping you with that days like

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.940
fucking thing, helping you switch gears into the next like

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.680
set of shit that you're gonna do.

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.361
Because both of us have started a business,

00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:16.981
both of us have earned some money,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.440
and we both understand what It is to be a stay at home mom and be like,

00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:24.241
oh my god, I feel so lost in life,

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:26.481
what can I do? And you just feel like such a haze or.

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:29.081
Or you feel the feeling of like, okay,

00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:30.241
but I could do so many things.

00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:31.841
I could bake cakes, I could clean houses.

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:34.081
I could fucking organize. I could this.

00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:35.241
I don't know. Like,

00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:37.381
we fucking got you.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.800
I'm not. I'm not fucking being scary

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:42.361
because I'm not a scary fucking person.

00:01:42.362 --> 00:01:45.721
