00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
I usually don't leave the house past 8:00 o'clock,

00:02.601 --> 00:04.521
but we're going to the icons party,

00:04.522 --> 00:06.821
so I decided to make an exception.

00:06.840 --> 00:07.880
Lucky got me sick,

00:07.881 --> 00:10.801
so I made him run and get me all the things to hopefully

00:10.802 --> 00:12.201
make me survive the night.

00:12.202 --> 00:15.241
At around four PM, three hours before the event,

00:15.242 --> 00:17.381
Marty came over to do my hair.

00:17.440 --> 00:20.480
The amount of gel and hairspray we used for this hair

00:20.481 --> 00:23.881
was almost criminal, but it didn't go anywhere all night long,

00:23.882 --> 00:25.241
so that's all that mattered.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.761
And I got started on doing my makeup.

00:27.762 --> 00:30.761
Kind of went with a variation of my everyday makeup

00:30.762 --> 00:33.121
since that's pretty much all I know how to do.

00:33.122 --> 00:35.161
We were about 30 minutes out from leaving.

00:35.162 --> 00:36.481
My stylist came over

00:36.482 --> 00:40.001
and we decided on the jewelry and got me into the dress.

00:40.002 --> 00:43.681
This was a two man job. The corset underneath was so tight,

00:43.682 --> 00:46.801
but we made it work. Right as we were getting this on,

00:46.802 --> 00:51.121
whimsy got hungry, so I nursed her and then put the older two to bed.

00:51.122 --> 00:54.321
Lucky's luck arrived 10 minutes before we had to leave.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.561
But lucky was so calm about it.

00:56.562 --> 00:58.761
Said he was gonna be ready in two minutes.

00:58.762 --> 01:00.241
Right after we got me dressed,

01:00.242 --> 01:02.161
which didn't end up being two minutes,

01:02.162 --> 01:05.441
we eventually made it into the car and over to the event.

01:05.442 --> 01:07.321
I loved hanging out with all the people

01:07.322 --> 01:10.641
and chatting to internet friends that I hadn't met before.

01:10.642 --> 01:13.681
As soon As my ankles felt like they were about to snap,

01:13.682 --> 01:15.165
I knew it was time to head home.
