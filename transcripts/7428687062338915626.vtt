00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.440
Abortion bans across the country

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:04.501
are making it even more difficult for women with cancer diagnosis

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.640
to get treatment and to survive their illnesses.

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:09.321
A 37 year old woman in Ohio was denied an abortion.

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:11.441
Her doctor said she needed to save her life

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:13.801
to continue treatment for her stage 3 melanoma.

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:15.121
Under Florida's abortion law,

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:17.561
terminal cancer patients will not get abortions

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:19.321
that they need to continue their treatment

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:22.161
because the abortion would not save their life,

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:23.801
it would only extend their life.

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:26.601
And Project 2025 even calls for the CDC

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:29.721
to track data on every pregnancy that is ended from a treatment

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:32.081
like chemotherapy. Attacks on a reproductive rights

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:34.961
are leaving women in an impossibly cruel situation

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:37.001
in an already devastating time in their lives.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.681
Literally imagine being told you have to spend your dying days

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:40.961
carrying a pregnancy to term

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:43.841
instead of getting treatment that could extend or save your life.

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:47.501
Bringing a child into this world that you won't be around to parent,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.120
or leaving children that you already have without a parent

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:51.641
because you can't get treatment.

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:52.361
We owe it to them

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:55.043
and to ourselves to vote to protect our reproductive rights.
