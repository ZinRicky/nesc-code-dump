00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.440
We raise our girls to believe

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.160
that they need to be quiet and agreeable,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.440
that they need to follow rules and get in line,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.440
to be pleasant,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.580
to be amable,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.480
to not be aggressive or defensive.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.340
We call women with opinions jealous or petty,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.000
women who stand up for themselves,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.820
bitches or psycho.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.600
And in some ways

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.040
we do the same thing to boys too.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.240
We have a very narrow minded idea of what a man must be.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.760
And we chip away at our boys until they fit that mold.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.220
And then we wonder why they can't express themselves.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.980
But with boys,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.440
the men they grow into,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.820
it seems to take their aggression out on others.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.140
Whereas women,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.400
we grow up believing that if we're not perfect,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.780
we're not worthy of love.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.200
And these messages are reiterated

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.100
and reiterated in our media,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.320
in our magazines,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.660
on social media,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.900
in our movies.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.080
And this issue is only amplified for people

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.920
who have to fight back against different stereotypes.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.280
But the greatest lesson is women

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.340
that we can learn

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.680
is that you don't have to be perfect

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.860
to be worthy of love.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.500
And that includes self love.
