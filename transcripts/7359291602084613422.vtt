00:00.120 --> 00:02.920
You know when a craving heads and you can't stop thinking about it?

00:02.921 --> 00:04.081
That's what happened to me.

00:04.082 --> 00:05.961
All I wanted was a focaccia sandwich,

00:05.962 --> 00:07.401
so that's what I had to make.

00:07.402 --> 00:09.841
Obviously also needed a lunch beverage.

00:09.842 --> 00:11.881
I can't do the taste of water lately,

00:11.882 --> 00:13.161
so I use liquid.

00:13.162 --> 00:15.421
IV love how these come sugar free

00:15.640 --> 00:19.160
and they have improved hydration in comparison to just water alone,

00:19.161 --> 00:20.961
which postpartum I love.

00:20.962 --> 00:22.121
After making my beverage,

00:22.122 --> 00:24.701
I move on to making a quick Jimmy Cherry.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.040
Chop up some parsley,

00:26.041 --> 00:27.121
shallot, garlic.

00:27.122 --> 00:28.921
Combine that with some olive oil,

00:28.922 --> 00:29.961
red wine vinegar,

00:29.962 --> 00:31.161
some oregano, salt,

00:31.162 --> 00:31.841
some lemon.

00:31.842 --> 00:35.721
Give that a good mix and set that aside while I chop up some tomatoes.

00:35.722 --> 00:37.401
Wanted to keep these really simple,

00:37.402 --> 00:38.961
so I just cut them in quarters,

00:38.962 --> 00:41.721
drizzle them with some olive oil and balsamic glaze.

00:41.722 --> 00:44.061
This point, my focaccia had risen,

00:44.120 --> 00:45.080
so I dimpled it

00:45.081 --> 00:48.081
and then decided to spread some red onions on top

00:48.082 --> 00:51.621
and some of that chimichurri before popping it in the oven to bake.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.520
Moved on to making some chicken cutlets.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.561
So I season my bread crumbs and flour

00:55.562 --> 00:58.561
before whisking up some eggs to dip my chicken in.

00:58.562 --> 01:00.441
And then I did a three step process.

01:00.442 --> 01:01.361
The flour first,

01:01.362 --> 01:02.241
then the egg,

01:02.242 --> 01:06.101
and then the bread crumbs before putting my chicken on a wire rack.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.160
Repeated this step with all of my chicken,

01:08.161 --> 01:11.761
and then fried it up in some olive oil and butter until it was golden.

01:11.762 --> 01:12.961
Brown. Once that was done,

01:12.962 --> 01:15.401
I set that aside and let it cool on a wire rack

01:15.402 --> 01:17.161
and pulled my focaccia out the oven.

01:17.162 --> 01:19.201
Sandwich needed some kind of creamy sauce,

01:19.202 --> 01:22.801
so I made elabrian chili aioli to go alongside it.

01:22.802 --> 01:24.241
And then it was time to assemble.

01:24.242 --> 01:26.061
So I cut my bread in half,

01:26.080 --> 01:28.000
spread some aioli on top the chicken,

01:28.001 --> 01:30.721
some arugula, the tomato chimichurri.

01:30.722 --> 01:32.881
Obviously needed to cut that in half.

01:32.882 --> 01:33.921
And there you go.

01:33.922 --> 01:36.581
This hit the spot and was so good.
