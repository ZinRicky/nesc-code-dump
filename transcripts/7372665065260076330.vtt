00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
Happy Friday, friends.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.820
I played pickleball this morning for three hours

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.260
with the older people at my community center,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.600
and I love them.

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.601
I know all their names.

00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:12.941
They all know me.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.280
They're so sweet.

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:17.521
I love it when they talk about me and they don't know.

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:20.281
I can hear them talking about me in the sweetest way possible.

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:21.941
And they're such encouragers.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.200
One of my favorite ladies is 86,

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:27.921
and she's a star on the pickleball court,

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:28.961
like, an absolute star.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:33.081
I love playing with her because she crushes it every single time.

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:35.001
And I heard talking about me today,

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.361
she's like, I just love Jen.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:39.241
Isn't she just the most darling?

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:41.201
I'm like, you're the most darling, Carol.

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:43.301
I love you. I love you.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.880
I thought a whole new community of people in pickleball.

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:49.661
This is your sign to start going to your local community center

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.440
and playing pickleball with older people

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:53.621
because they know how to freaking play pickleball.
