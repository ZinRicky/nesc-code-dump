00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.880
Last week I posted a video where I said

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:04.581
my husband and I are not equal partners in our marriage.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.280
This sparked a lot of comments

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:08.881
trying to point out to me that I'm not any less because I'm a woman

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:10.821
or because my husband is the main bread winner.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.440
These folks were so worried about me being subservient

00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:14.661
and less than my husband,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.020
but the statement that I made was completely ungendered.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.320
This society seems to be so worried about misogyny,

00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:22.321
but they immediately jump to the conclusion that

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.561
if my marriage is not equal,

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:24.761
then it must be I,

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.981
the woman, who is less important.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.880
So who has internalized misogyny now

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:31.901
to really prove that we are about Equality?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.380
Half the comments should have been worried for my husband.
