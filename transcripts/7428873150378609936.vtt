00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.549
if I have to bake another cake 

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.640
anytime soon after this

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.240
I may as well open a bakery

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:05.680
and I feel like if I've said it once

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:07.040
I've said it a thousand times

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:08.400
but it's birthday season

00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:10.160
and today we're celebrating a special 

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:11.920
someone who's turning the big 15

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:13.713
we're going for a fluffy vanilla sponge 

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:14.880
with a berry coulis centre

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.340
because their favourite colour is pink

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.529
I first met them back in 2014 and we've had a 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.000
lot of really good times together

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.760
which mainly involved keeping the lights on

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:23.493
and I don't know if you've ever tried to play a 

00:00:23.494 --> 00:00:24.251
birthday game with a 

00:00:24.252 --> 00:00:25.786
non physical entity before but 

00:00:25.787 --> 00:00:27.603
musical chairs, pass the parcel and

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:29.681
 pin the electricity bolt on the mascot 

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:30.720
were all epic fails

00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:32.717
so it's a good thing Powershop have given us 

00:00:32.718 --> 00:00:33.960
the birthday games this time

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:35.760
the games are surprisingly addictive

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:37.960
and there's a bunch of really cool prises up for grabs

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.800
including free power and you don't even need to be a customer to play

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.646
just head on over aim for a high score and you could win big
