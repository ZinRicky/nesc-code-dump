00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.900
something we got to talk about

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.320
so I know that there are some men in my comments

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.480
that are truly disgusting and infuriating right

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.940
like I'm talking the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.640
abortion is murder keep your legs shut crowd

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:16.040
and I'm here to remind you

00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:18.920
that about 80% of the country supports abortion access

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:21.560
I'm talking Republicans and Democrats alike

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:26.720
so it's not always the best use of your time to be arguing

00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:28.120
and getting in these common debates

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.940
as much as I love the engagement right

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.820
I selfishly love that

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.200
but it's not the best use of your activist energy to be engaging with them

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:40.440
because they represent a really small

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:42.200
extremist portion of the country

00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:43.780
we don't need their votes

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.520
you don't need to win them over

00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:48.260
this is Lily she's cwazy

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.560
focus on sharing accurate information

00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:53.640
focus on talking to people who you think might not be registered

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:55.880
focus on people who you think wanna learn about this issue

00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:59.200
remember in every state where abortion has been on the ballot

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:02.080
where voters have had a direct chance to vote on the issue

00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:06.040
even in red states abortion access has succeeded

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:07.600
it is what voters want

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:12.780
but if you wanna debate with Chad in my comments for two hours

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.368
that's fine too
