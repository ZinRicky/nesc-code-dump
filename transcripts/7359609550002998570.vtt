00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.160
human nature takes over

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:04.721
and doesn't matter how much you absolutely feel like you're in love

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:06.181
and this is gonna work forever

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.640
human nature is a thing

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:09.241
and humans grow

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:10.361
evolve and change

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:13.081
and that's that is the only certain thing that we know

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:15.401
I am right now a single mother to four kids

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:16.741
I'm 41 years old

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.160
and I was married for 10 years and

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:21.121
um realized that

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:26.681
that traditional gender life is miserable and lonely and sad

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:27.001
and

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:34.381
I was convinced that if I just found the right words to explain to my husband

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.500
the man who watched me birth four of his children unmedicated

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.220
saw me struggle through the adapting and changing of becoming a mother

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.440
I was so positive that if I just found the right words

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:51.881
the right combination

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:56.261
the right moment to say this perfect combination of words

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.940
he would finally get it

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.820
he would wake up and he would see

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.740
oh

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.440
I don't I'm so

00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:06.481
I didn't realize that this is what

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:07.961
I'm so sorry I'm so sorry

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:10.301
all the previous conversations that we've had

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.800
the 10 years you've been explaining these things to me

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.761
and how they've only gotten worse

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:19.681
I've never really improved any of these things you've been asking me to do

00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:20.441
babe I'm

00:01:20.442 --> 00:01:22.741
I'm never again

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.520
from today on

00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.081
I'm your husband

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:26.221
I'm your faithful husband like I promised you that day

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.020
but that's not reality

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.340
he does know he does know

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.180
he's an adult

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.360
if he is an adult functioning in this world

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:38.081
he's got jobs

00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:41.521
he's got other relationships that he's able to maintain

00:01:41.522 --> 00:01:44.801
he can go to the grocery store and come home without

00:01:44.802 --> 00:01:47.061
you know dying or getting arrested

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.380
he's a fully functioning adult that absolutely understands the pain he's causing

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.200
but he also understands that you are beholden to those marriage vows

00:01:57.201 --> 00:02:02.121
not him he knows that you hold to those marriage vows tightly

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.961
that you are bound by them

00:02:03.962 --> 00:02:05.581
but clearly he's not

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.040
so if you're staying in a marriage because it's been any length of time

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:13.441
number one that's the sunk cost fallacy

00:02:13.442 --> 00:02:16.041
you're just staying because there's been a long time

00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:18.581
but it's never gonna change

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.060
and he is never gonna wake up

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.820
because he already is awake

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.740
and he is manipulating the situation for his benefit

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.220
and he will continue to do so as long as you allow it
