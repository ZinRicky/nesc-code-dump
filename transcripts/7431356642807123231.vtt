00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
You know, when you meet someone and you don't know anything about them,

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:06.701
so you're a little leery of them, and, like,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.560
sometimes a Google search is not enough.

00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:10.021
Like, you're like, ugh,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.340
I wanna know more. That's where Public Data check comes in.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.800
I use Public Data check. You can do a reverse phone number lookup.

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:21.321
I love that. You can look for offenders in your area.

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.401
So you can enter your address,

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:23.681
and it will tell you in your whole area.

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:25.141
It will give you their picture,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.920
their whole crime history,

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:28.721
what they've been convicted of there at, like,

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:29.721
Unit A. Like,

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:31.541
this apartment complex, unit A.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.080
As a single mom, and I don't have a lot of, like,

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:36.041
family or, like,

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:37.761
people around, I.

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:40.841
I truly do want every little thing I can have

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:42.601
that's gonna make me feel safer

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:43.881
or informed or whatever.

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:46.521
And I absolutely love public data check.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:48.221
Like, absolutely love it.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.560
If I know you know that I have put your name in there,

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.481
and I know everything I need to know about you.

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:56.261
I have a link in my bio if you want to use it, because I.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.169
I'm here for it.
