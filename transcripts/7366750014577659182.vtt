Every one of these dudes bumping the Kendrick Lamar song,

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:08.361
I wanna hear them loud as fuck when they see a woman struggling

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:11.501
or they see a single mother that, like,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.320
need something.

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:13.961
Or every single one of those motherfuckers

00:00:13.962 --> 00:00:15.881
better be caught up on their child support and, like,

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.441
fully up in their child's lives.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.060
how the fuck can you listen to one of those Kendrick Lamar songs

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.960
and then talk shit on your baby mama?

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.961
Or talk shit on a single mother?

00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:27.781
Or talk shit or fucking.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.280
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:31.661
You better not be.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.000
They not like us.

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:34.081
They not like us,

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:35.721
but you just fucking like them.

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:37.561
You better watch your fucking step

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:39.521
if you're bumping that motherfucking song

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.021
for fucking real.
