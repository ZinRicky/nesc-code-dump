So right now on Instagram,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.160
Meta

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:05.301
is limiting your ability to see anything related to women's rights.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.480
Women's bodies, abortion rights,

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.601
elections, social justice,

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:12.601
environmentalism, the list goes on and on.

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:14.521
And they're doing this with a new feature.

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:16.841
It's called Limit Political Content.

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:18.181
What's considered political?

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.280
Not really sure. You can stay informed,

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.781
continue to see our posts on at feminist

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.000
and other posts from all your favorite creators

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.761
by simply turning off that function.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.381
Super easy. I'm gonna show you how it's done.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.200
Watch here. Tap the three dots at the top of your screen,

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.981
scroll down to Content Preferences,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.680
hit political Content, hit don't limit political content.

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:42.661
Then you're done. It's super easy.
