00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.600
Okay, so my understanding of it is that

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.640
because our society set

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.560
is set up like a patriarchy,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.160
which means it is not set up to accommodate women,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.520
mothers, and families,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.240
is the reason why you had to make the choice

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.000
in the first place.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.080
The world in which we live

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.400
that makes women work like they don't have kids

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.800
and have kids like they don't work

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.820
is a function of the patriarchy.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.060
If we lived in a much more equitable society,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.080
it would be assumed

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.080
that women could work and have children,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.780
and the workforce would be

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.400
accommodating to that lifestyle change.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.320
The fact that women are faced with such impossible

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.600
choices when having children and starting a family

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.180
is because we don't have Equality.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.500
The choices we make seem so shitty

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.400
because it was set up that way.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.160
Which is why

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.480
if it's financially feasible,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.840
it does seem a lot

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.200
easier to stay home with your children.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.940
Because that's the way our society

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.360
was set up in the first place,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.400
for women to be home and men to be working.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.120
And that's why,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.320
as much as it, like,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.240
sucks to say it,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.920
that's why people come to my comments and tell me

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.381
staying home is not a feminist choice.
