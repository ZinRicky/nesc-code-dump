00:00.080 --> 00:01.800
My husband doesn't cook.

00:01.800 --> 00:04.280
I told him I was craving a steak dinner tonight,

00:04.280 --> 00:06.400
but I was just too tired to make that.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.960
So he told me to sit down

00:07.960 --> 00:09.820
and that he would take over tonight

00:09.840 --> 00:11.480
and make me dinner for once.

00:11.480 --> 00:14.000
So I decided to just trust the process.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.760
But I was very skeptical when I saw how he

00:16.760 --> 00:18.380
cut those sweet potatoes.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.120
Started off by cutting some normal potatoes

00:21.120 --> 00:22.640
and Japanese sweet potatoes

00:22.640 --> 00:24.260
and also some red onion.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.600
He seasoned all of that with some olive oil

00:26.600 --> 00:27.840
and some spices,

00:27.840 --> 00:29.440
gave that a really good mix,

00:29.440 --> 00:31.400
and then put it all on a baking sheet.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.280
I think he realized that it was too much for one,

00:34.280 --> 00:36.140
so he divided it into two,

00:36.240 --> 00:37.600
spread that out evenly,

00:37.600 --> 00:40.700
and then drizzled it with even more olive oil.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.240
Once that was all mixed up,

00:42.240 --> 00:45.400
he popped that in the oven for about 30 minutes,

00:45.400 --> 00:49.280
10 hour, while he got started on his side salad.

00:49.280 --> 00:52.100
He loves making arugula salads,

00:52.400 --> 00:55.480
so he did arugula salads with a lemon

00:55.480 --> 00:56.640
olive oil dressing,

00:56.640 --> 00:58.440
which is actually super simple to make

00:58.440 --> 01:00.040
in one of our favorite dressings in the house.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.440
It's just lemon olive oil,

01:01.440 --> 01:02.620
some lemon pepper,

01:02.640 --> 01:04.880
garlic, and some salt.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.400
And slim decided to join

01:06.400 --> 01:08.360
and help dad with making dinner.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.360
We just prep the salad and set that to the side

01:11.360 --> 01:13.320
while he seared off some steaks.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.340
One thing lucky is good at is making good steak.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.440
He always gets it Right.

01:17.440 --> 01:20.900
So I was not worried about this part whatsoever.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.760
He reverse seasons it,

01:22.760 --> 01:26.020
so he puts on all the seasoning after it's done cooking.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.240
It was perfect.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.360
Just the way I like it.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.040
And then he dressed the salad,

01:30.040 --> 01:31.580
added the Parmesan cheese,

01:31.760 --> 01:34.040
mixed it up with very questionable utensils,

01:34.040 --> 01:35.820
and plated my dinner.
