00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.880
I started cooking from scratch using nutrient dense,

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:05.961
nourishing, local and in season ingredients six years ago

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:08.641
while I was pregnant with my little Angel, Olympia.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.361
Every year I look forward to the massive peach harvest

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:13.881
I get from the tree I planted four years ago.

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:15.281
I'm always looking for creative,

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.241
healthy ways to use my homegrown peaches.

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:20.461
Making food from scratch has quite literally changed my life,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.920
benefiting from more energy,

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.601
passion, unity and connection to the land.

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:26.361
Freshly milled whole grain flour,

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:29.381
a caramel sauce of water, coconut sugar and butter.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.400
I sift my flour for a lighter crumb

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:34.681
and grate in some whole nutmeg that offers a more pungent flavor.

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:36.521
Fresh caramel drizzled over my tree

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:38.961
ripened peach slices will be the top of the cake.

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:40.961
Then cream together sourdough,

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:44.881
discard butter, coconut sugar and three pasture eggs for my chickens.

00:00:44.882 --> 00:00:46.221
Using a hand mixer,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.280
this lightly sweetened batter is layered using a cookie scoop

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.121
and I bake the upside down peach cake

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:53.081
at 350 degrees degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:55.361
for about 30 minutes until golden and set.

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:57.801
The most exciting part is carefully dumping the cake

00:00:57.802 --> 00:01:01.381
and slowly releasing the cake pan from the perfectly shaped cake.
