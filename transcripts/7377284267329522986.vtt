00:00.000 --> 00:04.780
It's been kind of a heartbreaking day on the ranch today.

00:07.080 --> 00:11.100
Mother Goose, who had just successfully,

00:11.600 --> 00:13.440
you know, hatched her first Gosselin.

00:13.441 --> 00:16.741
And she's been with us for a long time.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.900
Um, we aren't sure what happened,

00:20.160 --> 00:22.740
but she was found, um,

00:23.280 --> 00:26.720
passed away on her nest this morning.

00:26.721 --> 00:27.081
You know,

00:27.082 --> 00:31.381
she still had a clutch of eggs that she was religiously sitting on,

00:31.680 --> 00:34.660
trying to get more than one costly in the hatch.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.380
And we think she just overworked herself.

00:40.440 --> 00:44.340
You know, she'd sit on that nest for most of the day,

00:44.400 --> 00:46.040
would get up to eat a little bit,

00:46.041 --> 00:47.381
drink a little bit,

00:47.520 --> 00:49.140
but she just.

00:50.040 --> 00:50.920
That's what we think.

00:50.921 --> 00:52.501
We don't really know.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.400
There's no evidence of blood

00:55.401 --> 00:58.241
or something attacked her or foul play or anything like that.

00:58.242 --> 01:00.901
Um, just a really sad deal.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.560
So we found her.

01:04.561 --> 01:05.641
There's papa goose,

01:05.642 --> 01:07.741
and the gosling is doing really well.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.120
He's here protecting mama goose.

01:10.121 --> 01:12.401
But as you can see,

01:12.402 --> 01:13.201
she's.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.900
She passed away right on her nest,

01:16.080 --> 01:19.940
where she had been sitting for the better part of,

01:20.200 --> 01:21.700
you know, the last month.

01:22.520 --> 01:24.060
It's really sad.
