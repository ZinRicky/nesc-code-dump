00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.640
I'm a stay at home mum in my 30s

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:03.135
which means I'm balls deep in my 

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.041
homemade bread phase

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:05.441
and once you make this focaccia 

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:06.450
you will be too because 

00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.881
what else are you gonna do all day?

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:09.081
and if you're a focaccia master

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:11.241
stay to the end and tell me how I can make it more bubbly

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:12.321
because I've tried and tried

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:14.398
and this is as aerated as I can make my dough 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.521
 mix tbsp of yeast with 420ml

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:18.881
 of warm water and a teaspoon of honey

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:20.281
add a tbsp of olive oil

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:23.121
500 grams of bread flour and two teaspoons of salt

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.281
give it a good mix until your dough starts to come together

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:27.601
and at this point it's gonna be extremely sticky

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:29.290
so don't be alarmed, it's totally normal 

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:30.321
cover it with a tea towel

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:31.521
let it rest for 15 minutes

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:33.641
and then start on your first round of stretch and folds

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.441
with wet hands gently pull the dough up

00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:37.121
fold it in the middle and spin the bowl

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:39.601
and I try and work my way around the bowl about three times

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:41.761
let it rest under your tea towel for another 15 minutes

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:43.641
and then perform another round of the stretch and folds

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.521
now we wanna let it rest for about an hour and a half

00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:46.801
before transferring it to a tray

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:47.881
lined with Parchment paper

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:48.921
which I've also oiled

00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:51.561
give it a little stretch and then you wanna fold it back and on itself

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:52.481
a bit like a burrito

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:55.081
before flipping it over so that the smooth side is facing up

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:56.961
she's gonna be a bit tired from all that exercise

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:58.681
so leave her alone for another hour and a half

00:00:58.682 --> 00:00:59.441
cover it with oil

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:01.009
then you wanna get your fingers in there 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.081
and start making some dimples

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:03.921
They don't have to be perfect but it is a vital step

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:05.793
it's gonna expel some of that air and help 

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:07.361
make your crust beautiful and crispy

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:10.121
the fun thing with focaccia is you can kinda top it with whatever you like

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:11.681
so it's up to you if you wanna make it 

00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:12.841
more simple or more intricate

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:16.161
I'm going simple today cause in my house we all love this combination of 

00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:17.039
Kelp salt and Rosemary 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.681
and if you oil herbs before popping them on

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:20.081
it's gonna help stop them from burning

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:22.801
bake it on the lowest rack in your oven at 220 degrees C

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:25.481
for about 20 minutes or until crispy and golden

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:27.121
but fair warning once you make it once

00:01:27.122 --> 00:01:28.441
you're gonna start making it everyday

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:30.495
and it's gonna completely consume your life
