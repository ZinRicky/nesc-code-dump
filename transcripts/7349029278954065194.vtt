00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.400
And that is called future faking.

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:05.641
And those little changes that he does are called,

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:08.881
like, little bread crumbs that he will leave you,

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:12.281
or, like, hanging the carrot on the fishing pole.

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:14.901
They're all just manipulation tactics.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.800
Um, and the whole like, oh,

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:17.961
I had a bad childhood,

00:00:17.962 --> 00:00:18.921
I had a hard day,

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:20.321
I had this, I had that.

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:23.061
If you read the book why does he do that?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.500
Inside the minds of angry and Controlling Men by Lundy Bancroft,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.120
he goes into that.

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:31.361
That is just another manipulation tool.

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:33.601
You probably didn't have the best fucking childhood,

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:35.601
or you probably had some experiences in your life

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:36.901
that is stuck with you.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.040
You don't use that to hurt people in your life,

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:42.081
especially the people closest to you.

00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:46.441
These are just manipulation tactics that someone is using

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:48.641
to take the good in you

00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:50.361
and use it for their gain

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:51.781
and to your detriment.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.080
And you have to see it for what it is,

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:57.781
acknowledge it so that you can move on.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.600
So I'm sending you so much love.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:03.381
Just remember, you're not crazy.
