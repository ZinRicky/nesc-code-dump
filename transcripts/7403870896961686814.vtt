00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.420
It has been two months since I moved in with my boyfriend,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.320
me and my four children. We didn't move into his house.

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:12.281
We. You both left our leases?

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:14.321
Like, we both had leases that were ending at the same time

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:17.361
and then moved into a new place together,

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:20.521
him and I. And I wanted to give you a little update

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:23.361
because I think a lot of people were counting on my downfall

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:26.241
and banking on it to fail.

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:28.641
And, sorry to say,

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:30.021
womp, womp.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.760
We have had more conflict than we're used to.

00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:37.781
And then, since we don't have our own respective houses,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.520
it's not like we could just go to our houses to, like,

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.741
cool off. We had to figure out how to, like,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.380
coexist in the middle of conflict and maintain respect.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.280
And I'm happy to fucking report this,

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:53.961
what we've done. We've had a couple miscommunications.

00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:56.201
Like, there was one night where I thought he was mad at me,

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:57.781
but he was just sad,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.280
and I took that as the silent treatment.

00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:01.441
And so then I was like, well,

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:04.641
in fact. And so then I went to another bedroom.

00:01:04.642 --> 00:01:05.601
I literally, like,

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:07.041
slept in my daughter's bedroom.

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:09.381
I was like, you don't wanna talk to me?

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.400
I won't be in your face. Like,

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:12.981
I got all fucking butt hurt.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.720
Um.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.200
And, you know,

00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:18.081
the next day, we talked,

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:19.121
and I was like, oh,

00:01:19.122 --> 00:01:23.021
my god, that was totally a misunderstanding on my part.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.380
See where I Was wrong there.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.920
Yeah, we've.

00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:33.021
I don't know, he's done some shit that I'm like,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.680
okay, cute.

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.061
I think it's more just like the way he is. Like,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.840
there has been a lot of like, alright,

00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:43.961
well, those are your kids.

00:01:43.962 --> 00:01:45.361
I'll see you later. Where.

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:47.081
When he came,

00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:49.621
when he was just my boyfriend and would just come to my house,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.480
there was no escaping. He was my boyfriend.

00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:52.841
Even if he was just in the like,

00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:54.521
he never gets involved in what's going on,

00:01:54.522 --> 00:01:55.741
but he would at least like,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.760
kind of be hanging out with me.

00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:58.641
So, like an adult that I could look at me like,

00:01:58.642 --> 00:01:59.941
are you fucking hearing this?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.720
And then that kind of disappeared.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.521
So there was like, a little bit less support,

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.541
and that was starting to drag me a little bit crazy.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.600
So we talked about it and he was like,

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:10.181
I see what you're saying. Um.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.960
But yeah,

00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:14.541
otherwise it's going pretty good,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.840
pretty fun. When the kids are here,

00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.921
it's like he calls them his little roomies,

00:02:20.922 --> 00:02:23.321
and he's, you know,

00:02:23.322 --> 00:02:25.721
building little relationships with them and,

00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:27.781
you know, um.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.600
Yeah, his and his relationship.

00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:31.721
His and mine relationship,

00:02:31.722 --> 00:02:36.041
I think took the natural hit that any relationship takes

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:37.881
when children are present all the time.

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:39.881
But I mean, I reminded him, like,

00:02:39.882 --> 00:02:42.321
this is my availability, period,

00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:42.881
you know? I mean,

00:02:42.882 --> 00:02:44.621
it's not like it's. I have.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.920
I have more availability for you now,

00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:48.601
if anything, because you Know,

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.881
we're here together, but there's still many nights where,

00:02:50.882 --> 00:02:53.601
you know, I go to sleep before him or whatever.

00:02:53.602 --> 00:02:54.401
So

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.880
I don't know. It's happy.

00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:58.801
His mom thought it was fucking hilarious

00:02:58.802 --> 00:03:02.621
that his picture was in that people magazine online article.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.360
Um, I thought that was adorable.

00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:05.841
I was like, yes,

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:06.921
cause I really liked my makeup.

00:03:06.922 --> 00:03:09.201
I thought it was cute. Speaking of that,

00:03:09.202 --> 00:03:10.361
I'm doing my makeup right now.

00:03:10.362 --> 00:03:12.001
But anyway, yeah,

00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:13.481
life has been nice. We've settled,

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:17.101
we're unpacked mostly. We're like 95% unpacked.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.760
He bought some plants for the house.

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:23.521
We're living it up, not living the dream.

00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:25.321
I'm just saying we're happy.

00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:27.841
It's fine. I don't like to, like,

00:03:27.842 --> 00:03:29.521
hype too much shit up, you know what I mean?

00:03:29.522 --> 00:03:31.021
There's some trauma there,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.657
but we're doing really good, so.
