00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.880
I am my husband's help me.

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:02.841
When I say that statement,

00:00:02.842 --> 00:00:04.281
I find there are two ditches to it.

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:07.681
One side finds it demeaning and makes women a second class citizen.

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:10.601
The other portrays women there's nothing more than a cook and a maid.

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:11.961
What's the point of an education

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:13.681
if she's just going to marry and have children?

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.721
Both of these have very low views of women.

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:18.581
Being a helper is being in a position of power.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.780
The influence a wife has over her husband is significant.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.680
Being a help me does not meeting an ideal,

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:27.081
perfect wife, but rather fulfilling what the Lord is commanded of wives,

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:28.641
glorifying him in the process.

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:30.081
Whatever that may look like for you.

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:32.121
Remember Proverbs 31 31.

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:33.281
Give her the fruit of her hands,

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:34.929
and let her works praise her in the gates.
