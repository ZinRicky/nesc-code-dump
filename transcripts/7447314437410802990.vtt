If you're looking for a boutique cocktail experience,

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:03.641
head over to Costa,

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:06.561
who just launched their new gin with Charleston Distilling Company

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:08.201
and are whipping up fresh cocktails

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:10.821
to highlight the beautiful product that they've put together.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.760
I personally really like their classic martini with their new gin,

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:15.441
as well as their take on the Salty Dog

00:00:15.442 --> 00:00:17.521
with just added a little bit of grapefruit

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:20.121
to bring out all the sweetness and floral notes of the gin.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:23.601
But the real highlight of the night was when the sommelier let us in

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:25.301
a beautiful shot tasting,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.620
instructing us to take a little shot of the gin,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.560
then have the caviar, let it roll around in our mouth.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:31.601
Yes, I know.

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:33.261
And then finish off the gin.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.760
I think

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:36.861
I've decided that all shots should be served with a shot of caviar.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.760
Now, if you're saying that you're not a gin drinker,

00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:42.361
this is the gin for you. It is sweet and floral and perfectly balanced,

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:45.321
and only available at Costa and at Zero George.

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:48.341
So go there and make sure you get a beautiful, dirty martini.
