00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.520
You know, this is definitely a lesson I Learned way too late in life.

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:06.701
And now at 41, it is a um,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.640
a rule I will stand by in my heart.

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:13.821
If there is a man, a grown ass man,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.820
that needs that much help,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.900
he got himself into that situation for a fucking reason.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.800
Because this world was made by men,

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:22.741
created by men, run by men.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.080
It is a big old boys club.

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:26.761
And girls are out here just trying to fight to stay alive,

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:30.581
literally to avoid violence and objectification.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.440
So if there is a man that is like that hard up and struggling

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:36.981
and needs that much help,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.800
he is a man that no one else wants to deal with.

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.841
He is probably violent, scary,

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:48.021
aggressive, and got to that place in life by his own doing.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.120
So yeah, the girls that fucking get it,

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:54.241
get it. I will literally never help a man. Never.

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:57.281
I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck what position you're in.

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:59.161
I don't know who the fuck you hurt or why you're there.

00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:02.521
And I'm not gonna put myself in danger anymore,

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:04.381
ever again. I'm like,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.400
I've even told my boyfriend like this has caused an issue with us.

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.961
Cause I'm like, I'm a little bit terrified of men right now.

00:01:09.962 --> 00:01:11.881
Like men fucking scare me.

00:01:11.882 --> 00:01:15.721
This is like, I've had this shit happen to me when I was younger, teens,

00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:17.681
20s, and now as a grown ass Woman.

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:21.421
To still have grown ass men acting this way,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.180
it's the biggest. Like

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.800
grown men in these fucked up situations got themselves there.

00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:31.241
They don't need anybody's fucking help.

00:01:31.242 --> 00:01:33.201
And if they need help, another fucking man can help them.

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:35.901
It is not a woman's place to be helping a man. Followed that shit.
