00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.840
Getting fat after you have a baby.

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:03.561
Bear with me,

00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:06.241
because I'm not about to say what you think I'm about to say.

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:09.161
If you are someone who is overweight or not

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:10.881
where you metabolically wanna be,

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:12.041
and you haven't had a baby

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:13.641
or you're planning on having a baby,

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:14.881
and you are scared.

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:18.321
You are terrified that you're just going to get worse

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:20.341
from the state that you are now

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.800
to after you have the baby and postpartum,

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:25.901
and you're gonna be one of those that never loses the baby weight.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.320
Listen to what I have to say.

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.341
I have not always been as thin as I am right now.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.560
In fact, for years,

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.681
I was always a little bit on the curvier side,

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:35.201
and I was very gachatona, meaning,

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.361
like, my face.

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:38.761
Gachatona is like, your face was chunky or chubby,

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:39.761
but it also adds, like,

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:41.461
a youthful appearance, right?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.160
I suffer with PCOS and endometriosis,

00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:45.961
inflammatory issues, chronic illness,

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:47.601
autoimmune, my entire life.

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:50.281
And I just didn't really connect the dots until I was older.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:52.281
But I was always terrified.

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:53.621
I mean, freaking terrified.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.280
After I had a baby,

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:58.041
I would be one of those that blew up like a freaking balloon

00:00:58.042 --> 00:00:59.881
and never was able to lose the weight,

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:01.281
because that, quite frankly,

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:04.721
had been my history since I was about 17 years old.

00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:07.921
But I desperately wanna offer you some encouragement, okay?

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:11.621
Because I had a baby. I've had two babies,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.600
and each one I Have lost more and more weight,

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:16.081
have gotten more and more healthy now.

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:20.701
Yes, there are things that I am doing that are aiding that journey

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.560
in getting healthier and losing weight

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:24.661
and being metabolically healthy.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.760
But I can tell you right now

00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:30.081
with all of my chronic feminine issues, endometriosis,

00:01:30.082 --> 00:01:31.901
PCOS, all the things.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.300
For years when I went to go see my doctor,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.080
their solution to everything was always, well,

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:39.541
you need to just have a baby.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.040
You need to have a baby. I remember taking my ex

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:44.001
and he went to one of my appointments with me

00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:45.521
and feel like she kind of pressured him

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:46.601
cause she was like, well,

00:01:46.602 --> 00:01:48.601
she's 28 years old, 29 years old,

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:51.481
she needs to have a baby. And all these issues will go away.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.300
there's a lot of truth behind that and a lot of scientific evidence.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.660
But what I want to tell you,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.740
as far as the weight is concerned

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.640
and the metabolic issues are concerned,

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:04.521
when I had a baby, I mean,

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:08.541
it completely reset my entire system.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.280
It reset my hormones, my fat distribution, everything.

00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:15.361
Now here's the science. Uh,

00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:16.201
scientifically,

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:22.521
we're actually most capable of carrying a child at around age 17.

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:24.061
That is scientifically

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.500
the age where we are supposed to be already bearing children.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.480
Now, as much as the feminist wanna be like,

00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:32.761
I'm more than having babies.

00:02:32.762 --> 00:02:35.561
Of course you are. There's other things that you can do in life, okay?

00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:38.241
And that You have value add in this world,

00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:39.241
but at the end of the day,

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:41.281
we are animals and we are biological,

00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:45.421
and biologically, we were created to create.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.000
With that said,

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:52.401
most women are not having babies until they're mid to late 30s now,

00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:55.421
especially with modern feminism or culture.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.560
Just everything from 17 years old to your mid 30s,

00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.641
end of your 30s, you're talking 15,

00:03:02.642 --> 00:03:07.561
20 years, two decades of not having a baby,

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:08.801
when biologically,

00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:12.681
your prime time to have a baby was about 17 years old.

00:03:12.682 --> 00:03:15.621
And again, you already know how I feel about having babies young.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.040
Um, I feel like we've been fed this really big lie

00:03:19.041 --> 00:03:20.281
that it's the end of the world,

00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:23.521
we get pregnant, that nothing can ever, um,

00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:26.921
good come in our lives, that our careers are dead,

00:03:26.922 --> 00:03:30.241
which doesn't even make even a little bit of sense,

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:32.921
especially considering our fertile windows this big.

00:03:32.922 --> 00:03:35.481
And I work in financial retirement advising,

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:39.881
and your time for retirement and building a career is this big.

00:03:39.882 --> 00:03:41.121
Anyway, I digress.

00:03:41.122 --> 00:03:43.901
But you are talking two decades

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.840
of something that's not happening to your body,

00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:50.481
that your body is expecting or somewhat wanting.

00:03:50.482 --> 00:03:51.161
Now, again,

00:03:51.162 --> 00:03:52.161
there is. Sorry,

00:03:52.162 --> 00:03:53.361
cut me off. Now, again,

00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.421
there is more scientific, um,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.240
reasoning to this for what I'm saying. Okay,

00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:00.841
more scientific verbiage and everything

00:04:00.842 --> 00:04:02.581
that makes a little bit more sense.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.940
But basically, your body wanted to have a baby starting at 17,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.000
but now you're 35, And you still haven't had a baby,

00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:11.921
but you're considering have a baby.

00:04:11.922 --> 00:04:14.941
That's where we're at. There is a huge chance,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.620
a huge possibility

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.700
that by the time you have a baby,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.920
your body will completely reset itself.

00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:27.081
The reason we are having all this inflammation and endometriosis,

00:04:27.082 --> 00:04:31.141
which is excessive lining on your uterus.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.320
Aside from environmental toxins,

00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:34.981
birth control, all that stuff,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.120
at the end of the day, a lot of it is just the fact

00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:41.581
that your body hasn't done what it wants to do.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.160
The uterine lining, that was excessively growing tissue,

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:49.281
which is endometriosis, that completely went away

00:04:49.282 --> 00:04:53.041
or just got real mild compared to the way it was before.

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:56.521
And even my mom said when she was having babies that with each baby,

00:04:56.522 --> 00:04:59.261
it just got better and better and easier and easier,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.340
as far as her body was concerned.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.360
But again, we are having babies so much later. Anyway,

00:05:05.361 --> 00:05:06.681
my whole point to this is,

00:05:06.682 --> 00:05:08.301
if you are so terrified

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.080
that you are going to gain an excessive amount of weight

00:05:12.081 --> 00:05:15.001
while you're pregnant, or if you are even then.

00:05:15.002 --> 00:05:16.681
I gained a lot of weight, okay?

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:18.641
I'm a big bird. I'm 5:11, okay?

00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:22.641
So I think my first son, I got up to 2:50.

00:05:22.642 --> 00:05:24.481
Like, you couldn't tell because I'm so tall.

00:05:24.482 --> 00:05:26.761
And I carried it well, but I was freaking heavy.

00:05:26.762 --> 00:05:28.741
I could feel it on my joints, everything.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.720
But my point is, even with the excessive weight gain,

00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:36.021
that I had. Carrying each child,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.620
I dropped the weight and even more,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.060
I am lighter now than I was in high school. Okay.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.480
We are fed so much misinformation

00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:54.081
and we are fed so much fear mongering

00:05:54.082 --> 00:05:57.641
that one having a baby just sounds terrifying in itself.

00:05:57.642 --> 00:06:03.761
Because everyone has their opinion that degrades motherhood,

00:06:03.762 --> 00:06:04.981
when in reality,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.460
those opinions should be redirected towards our culture

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.620
and our family lives. Um,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.100
because it's just. It's garbage.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.940
Um, it shouldn't be directed towards motherhood itself,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.680
but I just remember how scared I was when I was pregnant

00:06:22.681 --> 00:06:23.881
because I thought, you know,

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:25.741
I've always had a hard time losing weight.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.480
It's never gonna happen. No diet ever worked.

00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:29.961
Nothing ever worked. Like,

00:06:29.962 --> 00:06:33.421
I'm gonna have a baby, and I'm just gonna get bigger and bigger,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.200
and it is just gonna be detrimental to my self confidence,

00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:38.241
my ego, my health,

00:06:38.242 --> 00:06:40.801
everything. And that's not what happened, babe.

00:06:40.802 --> 00:06:43.661
Like, the weight fell off.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.000
And I don't mean this in a derogatory way whatsoever,

00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:48.601
but, like,

00:06:48.602 --> 00:06:49.841
when you have a baby,

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:52.581
if you really are putting your full effort to being,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.160
you know, using that as your job,

00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:57.161
like, your job is to take this tiny

00:06:57.162 --> 00:07:00.261
little human being through your fourth trimester

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.080
and make it have a secure attachment

00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:04.721
and make it grow independent

00:07:04.722 --> 00:07:08.681
and make it feel loved and healthy and valued.

00:07:08.682 --> 00:07:12.101
If you're pouring everything into that child,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.160
it's almost impossible to keep the weight on.

00:07:17.161 --> 00:07:19.921
Like I was breastfeeding I was taking walks,

00:07:19.922 --> 00:07:22.761
we were playing outside, I was doing activities.

00:07:22.762 --> 00:07:26.001
Of course, you lose a little bit of sleep and, like,

00:07:26.002 --> 00:07:29.061
you were always going like the freaking Energizer Bunny.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.600
Okay. And I don't even know when it happened,

00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:33.921
but I looked in the mirror and I was like,

00:07:33.922 --> 00:07:34.881
oh, my god.

00:07:34.882 --> 00:07:37.501
I don't even remember ever looking like this.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.040
Maybe when I was, like, 15.

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:41.421
And even then I was a little more catchy. Donna.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.800
So don't be scared. Because sometimes

00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:48.021
we just have to trust the process and the cycles of our body,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.200
especially in our fertile years.

00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:52.321
Because as much as we don't wanna think

00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:57.441
that our entire identity is tied up into being a mother, biologically,

00:07:57.442 --> 00:07:59.041
sometimes it is.

00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:03.801
And I'm speaking from experience and talking with my doctors.

00:08:03.802 --> 00:08:06.321
I know that a lot of this is scientific, um,

00:08:06.322 --> 00:08:11.041
scientifically founded, but it just reset everything.

00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:13.641
So don't worry, don't stress.

00:08:13.642 --> 00:08:14.601
And at the end of the day,

00:08:14.602 --> 00:08:17.341
even if you do gain weight and it's hard to lose,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.020
there are so many things that you can do

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.480
to get your body to bounce back and be healthy.

00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:24.521
I'm not talking about weight loss.

00:08:24.522 --> 00:08:27.241
I'm talking about just being healthy and being the best you you can be

00:08:27.242 --> 00:08:29.561
so that you can be the best mom to your children,

00:08:29.562 --> 00:08:30.941
best wife to your husband,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.920
whatever. Whatever it is that you wanna be good at,

00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:36.401
you can be that. It's not the end of the World,

00:08:36.402 --> 00:08:39.021
once you have a baby, and I promise you,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.160
like, I know very few women that actually didn't bounce back.

00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:47.441
And a lot of the time, it's just.

00:08:47.442 --> 00:08:52.081
It's our modern society. It is our toxic suit we're wearing every day.

00:08:52.082 --> 00:08:53.741
It's our modern medicine.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.220
But if you really fall into the ebbs and flows of motherhood,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.840
you're going to find it just flows like it's.

00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:05.721
It's gonna come off you. Anyway,

00:09:05.722 --> 00:09:07.081
that is my rant for tonight.

00:09:07.082 --> 00:09:07.921
My god, I'm sorry.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.567
It went on for nine minutes. Love you.
