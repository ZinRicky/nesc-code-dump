00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
Here's why I prefer the African net sponge to a regular loofah.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.520
So they're kind of the.

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.741
I mean, they're similar in design,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.680
but look, my boyfriend took a shower with this a long time ago,

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:15.081
and look how soaking wet it still is since it's all bunched up.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:17.081
This thing takes forever to dry.

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:19.201
The African net sponge,

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:21.661
because it's a long net,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.160
it dries out. I took a shower with this not long ago.

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:26.461
Already dry.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.280
There's not, like, big bunchy spots where it stays wet and be cut.

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:34.981
Like it's a bunch of tiny little knots on this nylon.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.080
And then it's also the nylon,

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.421
so it exfoliates perfectly.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.520
So you bunch it up just like what a regular loofah.

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.101
Bunch it up and exfoliate.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.600
Then when you wanna wash your back, boom,

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:48.881
ready to go. Do the whole shit,

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.861
no problem. And it's got the perfect exfoliation.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.520
These things are amazing.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:57.961
I just love that they fucking dry off.

00:00:57.962 --> 00:00:58.881
It's not nasty.

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:00.801
It's not still wet from your last shower

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:02.421
when you go to take your next shower.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.400
They're amazing.

00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:05.858
They're linked right here if you want to get one.
