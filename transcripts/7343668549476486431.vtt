00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.720
they don't make plus size clothing because they don't want us to look good

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:06.581
I firmly believe that one of the reasons why plus size people do not have access

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.580
to cute clothing is because it would be much harder

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.120
to contribute to the myth that fat people are unattractive and ugly

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:15.081
and lazy and slobs and

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:15.941
like whatever

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.120
if we actually have clothes that fit us and make us look good

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:23.241
because so many people do not have access to cute plus size clothes

00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:25.001
I spend a lot of time

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:25.841
a lot of money

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:30.121
and a lot of effort looking for clothing that I think is cool and fun

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:31.541
and unique and interesting

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.920
fits my body right

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:35.361
and that is a privilege that I am able to do

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:36.961
I'm able to have that privilege

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.361
that is not the case for every fat person

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:40.601
so a lot of the time

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:45.921
the clothing that the average fat person has access to is either a one of like

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:47.801
frumpy frocks that they give us

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:48.761
or it's like

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:49.801
slightly too small

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:51.321
and I don't care what size you are

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:53.161
I don't care if you're small or big

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:54.881
whatever like you

00:00:54.882 --> 00:00:56.121
if the clothing is

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.281
like ill fitting

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:59.961
it's not going to look very good on

00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:01.361
like obviously

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:02.401
I think you can pull it off

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:04.161
I know plenty of people that like

00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:06.201
wears tighter clothes and looks perfect on them

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:07.441
but like generally speaking

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:08.321
if you're trying to like

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:09.761
fit your body into pants

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:10.468
that don't fit you 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:11.821
or clothes that don't fit you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.600
that's not always the most

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:14.081
the most like

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:14.961
flattering thing

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:15.441
you know what I mean

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.061
like the muffin top that everyone is so afraid of

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.880
that happens because your pants are too small

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:21.881
so your stomach fat

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.401
like peeks over

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:26.261
and when you're wearing pants that fit your body

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.600
that doesn't happen

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.121
so then we get this like

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.321
stereotype of fat people like

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:33.721
stealing small people's clothing and like

00:01:33.722 --> 00:01:36.121
always squeezing into sizes that are too small

00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:36.481
and da da da

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:37.581
and it's like

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.760
they we do that

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:41.921
people do that because they don't have access to clothing in their size

00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:42.401
you understand

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.881
and I just don't think that you're able to like

00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:45.321
maximize your slay

00:01:45.322 --> 00:01:49.321
if you're trying to constantly find clothes that you can squeeze into

00:01:49.322 --> 00:01:52.041
instead of just by being able to buy clothes in your size

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:53.401
and we can have a conversation about

00:01:53.402 --> 00:01:55.401
the politics of flattering clothes another time

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:56.281
but the reality is

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.241
when fat people wear clothes that aren't flattering

00:01:58.242 --> 00:01:59.441
it automatically like

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:01.201
deems us as ugly to people

00:02:01.202 --> 00:02:04.521
but again that's a lot of people's only choice if they want like

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:06.041
trendy stylish clothes

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:06.881
and like for me

00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:07.601
it's on issue

00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:08.241
because I am

00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:09.481
like on the like

00:02:09.482 --> 00:02:11.121
the larger end of the plus size spectrum

00:02:11.122 --> 00:02:12.281
so I don't even have the option

00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:12.801
really to like

00:02:12.802 --> 00:02:13.961
squeeze into tighter clothes

00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:15.401
but I understand if you're like

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:16.681
on the smaller end of the spectrum

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:18.141
if you're like a 1416

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.520
and you really wanna wear this one item of clothing and

00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:21.441
like you know

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:22.321
it's a size 12

00:02:22.322 --> 00:02:23.321
you wanna squeeze into it like

00:02:23.322 --> 00:02:24.241
I understand that

00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:24.721
you know what I mean

00:02:24.722 --> 00:02:26.121
it's just like not fair

00:02:26.122 --> 00:02:28.241
it's not fair that you have to do that and like

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:29.321
if we don't wanna do that

00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:30.401
the other option is like

00:02:30.402 --> 00:02:33.121
have you been to a target section for plus sizes

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:35.001
like they have wild and fable

00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:36.321
I shop a lot of dresses from like

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:36.921
wild and fable

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:37.441
which is like

00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:38.281
their regular

00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:40.821
kind of youth ish line

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.880
um and online

00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:42.841
they go to a 4X

00:02:42.842 --> 00:02:45.761
and I look really good in those clothes I love them

00:02:45.762 --> 00:02:48.521
but all of those plus sizes are not available in store

00:02:48.522 --> 00:02:51.381
the plus sizes that are available in store are Ava and Viv

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.280
and Ava and Viv is just

00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:54.521
literally like

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:55.361
cottage core but like

00:02:55.362 --> 00:02:56.281
derogatory actually

00:02:56.282 --> 00:02:56.801
you know what it is

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:58.361
it's Little House in the Prairie core

00:02:58.362 --> 00:02:59.601
it's like shirts up to here

00:02:59.602 --> 00:03:00.441
dresses up to here

00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:02.481
like frilly big boxy

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.021
like no shape

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.640
it's it's I hate it

00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:07.241
do they relegate fat people to like

00:03:07.242 --> 00:03:08.841
either squeezing into tight

00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:09.881
fashionable clothing

00:03:09.882 --> 00:03:11.481
and it looking ill fitting on us

00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:13.321
or wearing clothing that's in our size

00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:13.881
and it's just like

00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:14.521
not flattering

00:03:14.522 --> 00:03:16.201
it's like from the 18th century

00:03:16.202 --> 00:03:17.001
and it doesn't look good

00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:17.921
no one wants to wear it

00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:18.881
and so obviously

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:20.321
perpetuates this kind of myth that

00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:21.361
like fat people

00:03:21.362 --> 00:03:22.841
can't dress fat people like

00:03:22.842 --> 00:03:23.601
can't look cool

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:24.481
they can't look stylish

00:03:24.482 --> 00:03:25.081
and it's like

00:03:25.082 --> 00:03:26.561
you're not giving us the option to

00:03:26.562 --> 00:03:27.121
and personally

00:03:27.122 --> 00:03:27.601
I think that

00:03:27.602 --> 00:03:29.921
some of the most fashion people I've ever seen in my life

00:03:29.922 --> 00:03:30.801
are plus size

00:03:30.802 --> 00:03:33.061
because we have to do that work to like

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.360
put in that extra effort

00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:35.481
to look stylish if

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:36.361
if you wanna do that

00:03:36.362 --> 00:03:37.161
as a fat person

00:03:37.162 --> 00:03:38.441
but it's just not fair that

00:03:38.442 --> 00:03:39.481
that's what we have to do

00:03:39.482 --> 00:03:41.001
and I truly genuinely

00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:42.121
believe that

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:43.901
at least a small reason

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.280
why the fashion industry

00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:46.341
doesn't make

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.360
plus size clothing

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:48.601
that is cool and fashionable

00:03:48.602 --> 00:03:49.641
cause like literally

00:03:49.642 --> 00:03:50.801
all you have to do is

00:03:50.802 --> 00:03:51.561
make it into plus

00:03:51.562 --> 00:03:52.801
I make the straight sizes

00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:53.721
plus size all you have to do 

00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:56.281
and the reason they don't do that (my theory at least) is because then

00:03:56.282 --> 00:03:57.481
they can't say

00:03:57.482 --> 00:03:59.001
that fat people don't look good

00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:00.201
cause like we do

00:04:00.202 --> 00:04:02.841
like when fat people wear cool clothing

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.361
like first of all

00:04:04.362 --> 00:04:05.281
you're more like

00:04:05.282 --> 00:04:06.001
you're more attractive

00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:06.881
because you're more confident

00:04:06.882 --> 00:04:07.721
I think that's a big thing

00:04:07.722 --> 00:04:08.961
sorry I'm literally just ranting

00:04:08.962 --> 00:04:09.801
but growing up like

00:04:09.802 --> 00:04:10.681
there's a period of time where

00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:12.881
all I really shopped at was macy's and Walmart

00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:13.841
because that was kind of

00:04:13.842 --> 00:04:15.641
the only place that I found clothes that fit me

00:04:15.642 --> 00:04:16.681
but obviously like

00:04:16.682 --> 00:04:17.841
the clothes weren't cute

00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:18.561
especially back

00:04:18.562 --> 00:04:19.321
in like 2000

00:04:19.322 --> 00:04:20.201
you know 12 13

00:04:20.202 --> 00:04:20.921
14 whatever like

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:22.001
it was old woman clothes

00:04:22.002 --> 00:04:23.321
it was hideous

00:04:23.322 --> 00:04:24.001
hideous like

00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:25.301
obviously I was gonna get bullied

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.300
and the moment I found

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.980
torrid and like

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.480
say what you want about it now

00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:31.241
but for me in

00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:31.961
like high school

00:04:31.962 --> 00:04:32.921
torrid was like

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:33.721
torrid was it

00:04:33.722 --> 00:04:34.881
that was the first time

00:04:34.882 --> 00:04:36.321
that I had seen clothes that were even like

00:04:36.322 --> 00:04:38.641
mildly trendy in my size

00:04:38.642 --> 00:04:40.221
and I have such a vivid memory

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.240
of going into the torrid dressing rooms

00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:43.361
for the first time

00:04:43.362 --> 00:04:44.321
and finding a

00:04:44.322 --> 00:04:45.921
bra that fit me

00:04:45.922 --> 00:04:47.361
and it wasn't like

00:04:47.362 --> 00:04:48.581
a sports bra

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.840
it was like an actual bra with cups

00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:51.441
and it was blue

00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:52.581
and black pattern

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.000
and I cried in the dressing room

00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:56.081
I cried positive

00:04:56.082 --> 00:04:57.241
for the first time in my life

00:04:57.242 --> 00:04:58.361
in a dressing room

00:04:58.362 --> 00:04:59.201
because I was like

00:04:59.202 --> 00:05:00.241
oh my god like

00:05:00.242 --> 00:05:01.081
this fits me

00:05:01.082 --> 00:05:01.881
and it's cute

00:05:01.882 --> 00:05:03.321
it was genuinely

00:05:03.322 --> 00:05:04.861
one of those experiences that I

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.000
it's a flashable memory

00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:07.241
I I to this day

00:05:07.242 --> 00:05:08.441
remember how I felt

00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:09.401
when that happened

00:05:09.402 --> 00:05:10.041
and literally

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:11.521
like my entire

00:05:11.522 --> 00:05:12.841
like attitude

00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:13.921
shifted after that

00:05:13.922 --> 00:05:14.681
like because

00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:15.361
I started wearing

00:05:15.362 --> 00:05:16.841
clothes that fit me well

00:05:16.842 --> 00:05:18.201
and that were cool and like

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:19.401
I had autonomy

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.801
and it genuinely

00:05:20.802 --> 00:05:21.441
made such an

00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:22.121
impact on the

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:22.801
way that I felt

00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:23.761
about myself

00:05:23.762 --> 00:05:24.761
and that was then

00:05:24.762 --> 00:05:25.441
and obviously like

00:05:25.442 --> 00:05:26.121
things have changed

00:05:26.122 --> 00:05:27.081
in the fat fashion world

00:05:27.082 --> 00:05:28.361
but I just know for me

00:05:28.362 --> 00:05:29.281
how important

00:05:29.282 --> 00:05:30.561
my fashion is

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:31.561
to my confidence

00:05:31.562 --> 00:05:32.721
and just how attractive

00:05:32.722 --> 00:05:33.861
I think that I am

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.640
in my opinion

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:35.721
generally the right outfit

00:05:35.722 --> 00:05:36.241
is the difference

00:05:36.242 --> 00:05:36.561
between like

00:05:36.562 --> 00:05:37.201
a 5 and a 10

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:38.081
like I'm BI but

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:39.121
I'm not attracted to one

00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:40.441
like physical attribute

00:05:40.442 --> 00:05:41.841
I literally am

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:42.361
attracted to

00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:43.281
people that like

00:05:43.282 --> 00:05:44.361
wear black and like

00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:46.201
wear alternative clothing and like

00:05:46.202 --> 00:05:46.801
the style that

00:05:46.802 --> 00:05:47.521
like the style

00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.621
that people wear

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.040
genuinely will make me

00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:51.001
attracted like

00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:52.041
that's besides the point

00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:52.921
style and fashion

00:05:52.922 --> 00:05:53.881
is so important

00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:54.881
and I think that

00:05:54.882 --> 00:05:56.081
letting fat people have

00:05:56.082 --> 00:05:57.441
autonomy and like

00:05:57.442 --> 00:05:58.361
have the choice

00:05:58.362 --> 00:05:59.721
to look cool

00:05:59.722 --> 00:06:00.441
and look fashionable

00:06:00.442 --> 00:06:01.041
and dressed the

00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:01.761
way they want

00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:03.041
is so revolutionary

00:06:03.042 --> 00:06:03.481
and the fact

00:06:03.482 --> 00:06:04.921
that we're walking it back now

00:06:04.922 --> 00:06:05.921
is not lost on me

00:06:05.922 --> 00:06:06.441
and I just like

00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:07.041
cause that's

00:06:07.042 --> 00:06:07.401
the only thing

00:06:07.402 --> 00:06:08.521
that makes sense to me

00:06:08.522 --> 00:06:09.681
because what other

00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:10.601
reason would

00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:12.341
the fashion industry have

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.360
do not cater to

00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:14.281
plus size people

00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:16.881
considering that 67%

00:06:16.882 --> 00:06:18.241
like two thirds

00:06:18.242 --> 00:06:18.961
of this country

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.401
is plus size and like

00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:21.721
we are only like

00:06:21.722 --> 00:06:23.341
20% of the market

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.440
if that anyways

00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:25.161
this has been long enough

00:06:25.162 --> 00:06:26.241
I can talk about this for

00:06:26.242 --> 00:06:27.081
literally ages

00:06:27.082 --> 00:06:27.801
but the fashion industry

00:06:27.802 --> 00:06:28.721
just doesn't want fat

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:29.921
people to reach their full potential

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:31.121
and I am 100%

00:06:31.122 --> 00:06:31.479
certain of that
