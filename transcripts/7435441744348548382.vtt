00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
American women you are not oppressed

00:01.921 --> 00:03.680
I know everybody is telling you you are

00:03.681 --> 00:07.780
but the truth is if you are a woman living in the United States in the year 2024

00:07.800 --> 00:09.760
you have more luxuries and more freedoms

00:09.761 --> 00:13.360
than 99% of human beings who have ever walked this earth

00:13.361 --> 00:14.880
if you wanna run for public office

00:14.881 --> 00:16.240
you can run for public office

00:16.241 --> 00:18.520
if you wanna own land or a business or a home

00:18.521 --> 00:19.120
you can do that

00:19.121 --> 00:22.880
if you wanna go to school and become a doctor or a lawyer or anything else

00:22.881 --> 00:24.320
you can if you wanna have children

00:24.321 --> 00:26.600
you can have children if you get pregnant and want an abortion

00:26.601 --> 00:28.320
you can have one if you wanna get pregnant

00:28.321 --> 00:32.120
and then decide in the third trimester that you actually don't wanna be a mom

00:32.121 --> 00:34.800
then you can just hop on over to one of the six or seven blue states

00:34.801 --> 00:36.320
that will allow you to do that

00:36.321 --> 00:37.840
and you can do it no questions asked

00:37.841 --> 00:39.320
how about it you wanna get married

00:39.321 --> 00:41.040
you can get married if you wanna get divorced

00:41.041 --> 00:42.520
you can get divorced and legally

00:42.521 --> 00:44.680
you will probably have the upper hand in that

00:44.681 --> 00:45.240
to be honest

00:45.241 --> 00:48.640
the most outspoken people who claim to be victims and all of this are

00:48.641 --> 00:50.960
well to do white women that's who I'm seeing

00:50.961 --> 00:52.200
and the be Frank

00:52.201 --> 00:55.540
all of the drama and the theatrics around this

00:55.720 --> 00:58.600
are why a lot of people don't take women seriously

00:58.601 --> 01:01.480
you can't look around at this country and all the freedoms that we have

01:01.481 --> 01:03.460
and all of the luxury that we have

01:03.720 --> 01:05.000
and claim to be oppressed

01:05.001 --> 01:06.320
you just can't I get it

01:06.321 --> 01:09.200
it sucks when your candidate doesn't win an election

01:09.201 --> 01:10.720
especially if you've been invested in it

01:10.721 --> 01:12.960
especially if you feel very passionate about them

01:12.961 --> 01:14.640
but let's be honest with ourselves

01:14.641 --> 01:16.760
we are privileged beyond belief

01:16.761 --> 01:17.720
and if you look at history

01:17.721 --> 01:18.840
and you look at your ancestors

01:18.841 --> 01:21.200
and you look at the women and the people who came before you

01:21.201 --> 01:24.200
you will very quickly realize just how privileged you are

01:24.201 --> 01:26.480
victimhood is real and oppression is real

01:26.481 --> 01:28.920
countries that victimize women exist

01:28.921 --> 01:30.800
but ours is not we are not victims

01:30.801 --> 01:32.048
and that is a wonderful thing
