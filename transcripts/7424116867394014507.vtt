00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.040
My day in a life as a 25 year old trap wife.

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:04.801
We started our morning activity with watercolors for Wind Week.

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:08.121
Got myself a shower and then I went ahead and fixed stop our room.

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:10.201
I really love opening the windows in the morning.

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:12.961
Practice some piano which I am struggling with.

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:14.961
And then this room just needed picked up.

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:15.841
It was driving me nuts.

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:19.001
My toddler now thinks it's funny to chase me around when I'm vacuuming.

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.921
Did our Bible time and some catechism

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:22.961
and then ran out the door to piano lessons.

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:25.081
I've taken lessons since I was about 10,

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:27.441
but recently restarted because I have lost a lot of my skills.

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:29.401
You're never too old to restart something you love.

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:31.721
This is my parents dog and he's attached to my daughter.

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:34.441
Anytime I leave the house this is him through the window.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:37.481
Got home just in time to start my side dish for dinner.

00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:40.261
They're like baked potatoes but cut in half so they cook faster.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.560
After dinner I just unloaded the dishwasher,

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.561
reloaded the dishwasher, got it going,

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:46.521
and then at this point I really needed a coffee.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:48.201
Pick me up away the leftovers

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:49.841
and then I started laundry.

00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.201
This is like my day in reverse.

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:53.201
Normally start my morning with laundry,

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:55.281
but since I was out of the house for most of the day,

00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:56.561
it's just getting done in the evening.

00:00:56.562 --> 00:00:58.321
My goal every day is to do one load of laundry

00:00:58.322 --> 00:00:59.681
and to Fold one load of laundry.

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:01.701
Now, whether that gets put away is another story.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.680
I ended up putting my kitchen to bed for the night.

00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:05.001
Read a little bit in my Kindle.

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.681
I kind of just hop around and then watch some hockey with my husband.

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:08.616
Let's go, pens!
