00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.040
I'm taking a break from decorating for my daughter's birthday because,

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.501
A, I think I'm gonna collapse,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.840
and B, because I just left around my mouth.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.161
So let's go. The white women on this app who are like,

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:14.001
how do I make you feel safe around me?

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.041
Black women. How do I, um,

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.261
do better? It's giving

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.000
like the husband who asks for a list, right?

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:23.521
Like, I'm here to help.

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:24.761
Just tell me how to help.

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:28.961
Not realizing that you were causing more work and labor on their part.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.241
The information is out there,

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:32.001
and I know that because it's on TikTok.

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:37.161
There are black women on here who have tirelessly been educating

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.441
into the ethos for years now.

00:00:39.442 --> 00:00:41.201
So if you actually wanted the information,

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:42.721
you could find it. You just want it, like,

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:43.761
spoon fed to you

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:46.561
because you don't want to do any fucking work or effort at all,

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:51.561
and you want a participation trophy in self education. Also,

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:54.241
I think part of it is kind of, like, nefarious.

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:55.601
And this might be just, like,

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:56.681
being kind of a hater,

00:00:56.682 --> 00:01:00.001
but I think it's so you can have black women come in your comments

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:01.881
and they be angry at you. So you could be like,

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:04.361
I asked, I did the work.

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:08.021
And they were so mean. They were so defensive,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.000
when in reality, this is the equivalent of, like,

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.801
Susie and Johnny. Susie has four kids.

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:15.921
She's overwhelmed. She's running the house.

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:18.121
She's got the chores. And the lists and schedules,

00:01:18.122 --> 00:01:20.821
and Johnny just walks in with his, like,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.600
dirty shoes, and it's like, yeah, yeah,

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:24.521
I'm here to help. That is like,

00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:27.081
performative acting. You want,

00:01:27.082 --> 00:01:27.961
like, the participation.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:29.301
You're not actually helping.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.840
And listen, nobody knows what they don't know.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.981
But maybe try switching up that algorithm.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.740
Maybe get some different things coming to your feed.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.800
And don't get me wrong, I am not better than anyone, okay?

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.881
Like, white supremacy is the default of our society.

00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:45.721
You have to unlearn that shit.

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:47.281
And it takes work, and it takes effort,

00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:49.581
and it takes intention, and it takes listening,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.720
and it is an ongoing process.

00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:52.801
So I don't blame anyone

00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:54.441
for being at a lower chapter

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:57.961
of their journey of education and deconstruction than I am.

00:01:57.962 --> 00:01:59.441
But I am saying, like,

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:01.441
I didn't ask for help, like,

00:02:01.442 --> 00:02:03.681
out loud. The information's out there.

00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:07.301
Cause you'd give shit to Chad for asking for a list, too.
