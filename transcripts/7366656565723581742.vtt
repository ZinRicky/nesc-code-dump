00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
Just. It's so weird.

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:02.561
It's so weird what we're doing.

00:00:02.562 --> 00:00:06.581
I've never had this little information

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.840
going into any situation in my entire life.

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.761
We don't know one of their.

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:13.681
Anything about my guy.

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:14.321
We know nothing.

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:15.081
We don't know his name.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:16.001
We don't know what he looks like.

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.521
We don't know anything about it.

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:19.121
It's true. This is so odd.

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:20.401
It's very black cat,

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:21.341
golden retriever.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.880
Fully pink. Liz read one comment that said that and has really,

00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:28.041
like, really stuck to this. Yeah,

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:29.761
black cat, golden retriever thing.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.721
But that's what a black cat would say.

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:33.521
Like, you're. You being annoyed?

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:35.201
It sounds racist. No.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.201
We're gonna have so much fun.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.701
We're probably gonna be together.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.880
I have parts,

00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:45.601
but some of my worst parts come out when I'm with you. In a safe way.

00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:47.321
Like in a sisterly way.

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:48.841
This will be so much more fun.

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:49.801
Well, if it starts sucking,

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:52.001
we'll just talk. Exactly.

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:53.461
I want to buy merch.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.820
I just remember this night.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.260
Just left the date.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.980
It's like, slowly.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.620
How was it?

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.618
You guys are gonna have to listen to the episode to hear how it went.
