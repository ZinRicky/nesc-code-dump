00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.460
Update on the curse. I look like I'm gonna be a church leader.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.480
Like, what, who,

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:07.681
who evil I'd be.

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:10.401
So the place that I'm going that I go to get my hair cut,

00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:11.261
I'm inside. Iron

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.040
automatically does, like,

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.281
blowouts, and he already started blowing my hair,

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:15.721
and it, like,

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:17.761
was too frizzy to put gel in.

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:18.701
So I was like, whatever.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.840
Just finished a lot.

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:24.361
And I literally look like I am going to church on Sunday

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:26.441
and gonna bring a casserole dish with me.

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:27.961
Like, I. I.

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:29.681
No matter how I, like,

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:34.281
lay this hair, I just look so,

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:35.541
like, matronly

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.460
and I don't know how to, like,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.780
I'm not meant. I'm not meant for blowout hair.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.400
And I was like, maybe I can clip it and, like.

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:47.841
But the thing is, the bangs.

00:00:47.842 --> 00:00:48.981
Like, I finally.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.840
I cut bangs after a while

00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:52.701
cause I saw,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.420
like, see this, guys?

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.160
I look fucking old. I look old and elderly.

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.461
I look bad.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.700
Also, my nail.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.400
This is not on the nail bed,

00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:11.921
so I can't get long nails.

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:15.201
So let's recap. And it's fashion week.

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:16.521
Let's recap. Glasses,

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:19.001
broken nails, short hair,

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:20.621
not curly. Who am I?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.660
Who, what, who.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.240
Who am I? Because this.

00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:27.281
I don't. Okay,

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:28.361
someone's pregnant. And thing is,

00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:29.441
the thing is, the thing is,

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:30.801
I'm gonna handle it. Like,

00:01:30.802 --> 00:01:33.161
I'm gonna figure it out. But someone,

00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:34.401
someone is praying on my downfall,

00:01:34.402 --> 00:01:36.161
and I don't know which one of you bitches

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.281
it Is I have some names.

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:42.241
But I am going to be sending these curses back out 10 folds.

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:43.341
Watch your back.
