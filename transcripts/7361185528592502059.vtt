Today we are making some sourdough discard goldfish for my toddler.

00:05.840 --> 00:10.080
I actually have this core memory of myself when I was pregnant

00:10.081 --> 00:12.581
towards the end, that I was like,

00:12.960 --> 00:17.980
I wanna be that mom that makes everything from scratch for her kids.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.600
And I just had no idea how I was gonna do it,

00:20.601 --> 00:23.401
because I truly did not make anything really

00:23.402 --> 00:25.581
from scratch when I was pregnant.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.600
And I was just looking back while I was making this for my daughter,

00:29.601 --> 00:30.681
and I just, like,

00:30.682 --> 00:31.401
was like, wow,

00:31.402 --> 00:34.001
I'm so proud of myself, because truly,

00:34.002 --> 00:35.721
I've came a long way. And

00:35.722 --> 00:38.721
I can't believe I'm making all these foods from scratch

00:38.722 --> 00:39.781
for my toddler,

00:40.080 --> 00:43.960
and I can't believe I've Learned how to do all this on my own.

00:43.961 --> 00:49.121
So that is a reminder that you can go from not cooking from scratch,

00:49.122 --> 00:54.021
not knowing how to cook, to completely changing it around and learning.
