00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.620
To my sisters, to spirit kin and gender diverse relatives,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.980
hear me when I say this.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.020
We are our own liberators.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.740
For far too long, our realities have been silenced,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:26.420
our voices absent, our bodies subjugated to the violence of colonialism

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.780
and our spaces made to shrink.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.420
Those days are over.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.260
This is the era of matriarchy

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.060
where we heal and where we thrive,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.900
where we take up space, where we take up all of the space.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.580
We are strong, resilient,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.500
generous, fears,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.020
compassionate and we are deeply loving.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.740
We are the descendants of warriors,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.820
matriarchs, storytellers and teachers.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.100
We are our ancestors greatest legacy.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.700
We are the next generation of ancestors.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.860
So live in that sacredness.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.780
Step into your power. Live your fullest,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:41.780
most joyful, vibrant life. We deserve nothing less.
