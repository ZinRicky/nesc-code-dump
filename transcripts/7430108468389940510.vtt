00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.500
Fuck tipping culture and fuck Dutch brothers.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.280
Because I've heard many people say that you don't tip

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:08.721
and then they make your coffee wrong.

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:10.041
And what happened to me this morning,

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.441
I didn't tip and didn't make my fucking coffee wrong.

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:14.401
And I wouldn't be super, like,

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:15.121
paranoid about it

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:17.441
if it weren't for the way the girl at the window looked at me.

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:18.761
She was like, you got the two,

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:19.441
blah, blah, blah,

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:22.441
said it right, and then handed them to me.

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:23.441
Another thing that they always do,

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:25.721
they always put the little sticker to cover the whole.

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:26.281
They didn't. Like,

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:28.801
she didn't do none of the shit that they do.

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:31.561
And again, I've heard it online from other people that Dutch brothers,

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:34.701
specifically, when you don't tip at the thing,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.180
they're gonna fuck up your order.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.440
Good job, Dutch Bros.

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:38.507
You lost a customer today.
