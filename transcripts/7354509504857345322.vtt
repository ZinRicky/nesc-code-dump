The wallflowers at bath and Body Works can be a little bit pricey.

00:02.521 --> 00:04.921
So here is my little hack for when they're not on sale.

00:04.922 --> 00:08.341
I go to Walmart and I grab these Better Homes and gardens refills.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.420
I unscrew the plugins and the toppers from each of the bottles.

00:12.960 --> 00:14.240
I grab some pliers.

00:14.241 --> 00:15.201
It can take some work,

00:15.202 --> 00:17.061
but I gently remove just the wig,

00:17.400 --> 00:20.460
set it aside, and then do the same thing with the new bottle.

00:22.360 --> 00:26.280
Then I'm gonna pour the oil from the new bottle into the old one.

00:26.281 --> 00:27.481
And I'm very, very careful.

00:27.482 --> 00:28.721
You don't wanna spill any of this.

00:28.722 --> 00:29.881
You don't wanna get it on your hands.

00:29.882 --> 00:32.701
I actually recommend wearing gloves if you can.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.340
And then I'm gonna put the new Wick into the bottle,

00:41.440 --> 00:44.100
and you want about this much to be sticking out.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.840
And then I'm gonna screw back into the plug in.

00:46.841 --> 00:48.001
I've been using these for years,

00:48.002 --> 00:50.921
and yet I always forget to screw it the opposite direction at first.

00:50.922 --> 00:51.981
But there you have it.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.920
These ones are about half the price of the bath and Body Works refills.

00:55.921 --> 00:57.641
And I refuse to buy them when they aren't on sale.

00:57.642 --> 00:59.381
So this is what I do in the meantime.
