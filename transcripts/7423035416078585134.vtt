00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.720
We will have officially owned this house for two weeks on Wednesday,

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:07.661
and we are now prepping for Hurricane No. 2 in this house.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.640
That feels like some kind of bad omen or something,

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:13.701
but here we are. This is our reality.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.600
The last one we just got the outer bands of,

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:18.801
and it kind of skirted along the West Coast.

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:19.921
This one's coming right for us.

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:22.601
So it's a little bit more prep involved,

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:26.121
A little more anxiety and fear.

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:29.341
It's giving Ian vibes, and I don't really love that.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.900
So let's get prepped for another Hurricane.
