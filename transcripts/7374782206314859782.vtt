00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
These censorship laws are springing up provincially and municipally.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.120
Trudeau opened the door, so to speak,

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:09.221
and these lower level politicians walked right through.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.480
For example, in Manitoba,

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:16.441
the socialist NDP government has moved Bill 8 to criminalize peaceful

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:17.701
pro life expression,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.140
an even silent prayer on every taxpayer on public sidewalk

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.140
within a radius of 50 meters

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.060
around every abortion facility in the province.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.440
And all of these cruel and dictatorial

00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:32.901
censorship laws have the same goal

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.360
to silence Canadians

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:37.861
who are trying to defend the human rights of preborn children.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.420
Lower level politician here.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.940
This clip is laden with right wing dog whistles.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.940
His portrayal of Bill 8 is inaccurate.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.580
Bill 8 does not stop citizens from gathering or expressing their views.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.820
Folks can still pray or protest.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.760
It's just that now

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:05.321
they can pray or protest 150 meters away from a hospital

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:08.501
or a clinic or an abortion providers home.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.160
As I've always said,

00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:14.201
anti choice folks are more than welcome to come and pray and protest

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:16.221
here at the Manitoba legislature.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.620
My Bill will increase safety and dignity for Manitobans

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.140
accessing a wide range of reproductive health,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.700
including abortion.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.620
I wouldn't have had to have initiated this legislation

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.260
if individuals weren't harassing and intimidating Manitobans

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.520
who are accessing abortion services.

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:39.761
It's as simple as that. Finally,

00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:40.961
let me just say this. Uh,

00:01:40.962 --> 00:01:43.881
leave it to a man to give credit to another man

00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:45.681
for all the hard work that we

00:01:45.682 --> 00:01:48.021
as women have done for decades.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.360
In advocating for reproductive justice

00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:53.481
and ensuring safe abortion access.

00:01:53.482 --> 00:01:57.081
It's taken me almost seven years to get Bill 8 done.

00:01:57.082 --> 00:02:00.361
But Bill 8 will receive Royal Ascent on Monday,

00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:05.081
June 3rd, 2024, and will become law of the land here in Manitoba.

00:02:05.082 --> 00:02:07.781
I'm super excited and proud of this work.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.400
I dedicate Bill 8 to all of the women

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:12.961
and gender diverse folks who have fought for abortion

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:16.181
access and safety for the last 50+ years.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.760
In particular, I dedicate Bill 8 to all of our US relatives

00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:24.201
fighting the most draconian,

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:26.161
archaic, anti women,

00:02:26.162 --> 00:02:27.641
anti trans, anti queer,

00:02:27.642 --> 00:02:31.701
misogynistic, patriarchal laws seeking to,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.760
to ban abortion. I will always stand with you

00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:38.601
and I will always raise my voice to highlight what's going on

00:02:38.602 --> 00:02:41.181
next door and also here in Manitoba.
