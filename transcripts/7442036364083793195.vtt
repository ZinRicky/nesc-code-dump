00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.860
So I thought I was gonna go as alphabet.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.580
I thought I was gonna go green,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.060
but I think deep down I like pink too much.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.260
What do we think? This is my option for Glenda,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.100
and I have a much more casual outfit for Alphabet.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.040
I don't know what to go. I'm gonna go with my kids,

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.441
and it's a three hour movie.

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:27.801
So I'm thinking sweatshirt,

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:35.301
green skirt. But this outfit needs its own moment.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.340
But I don't know if the movie theater is the place for it.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.620
And it's way too fancy for just every day.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.300
But I think I found a new holiday look.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.100
Glenda style. What are you, Elphaba or Glenda
