00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.840
By now, we've all heard. Nick the all and Natalie Joy got married.

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:07.121
He's 43, she's 25.

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:09.441
It was on her family farm in Georgia.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.721
Just beautiful nuptials between, like,

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:13.021
the beautiful couple.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.680
Kinda reminds me of the beautiful love story of Charlie John's

00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:18.321
and his wife, Eunice Winstead.

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:20.721
They actually only had a 15 year age difference,

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.601
but, gosh, they were married for 60 years.

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.681
They had 9 beautiful children.

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:26.201
I know the veils already have one

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:27.921
that was in their arms at the wedding.

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:30.921
It's just. It's beautiful to see love grow like that,

00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:32.721
you know, beautiful love over the time,

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:33.910
over the ages. I love it.
