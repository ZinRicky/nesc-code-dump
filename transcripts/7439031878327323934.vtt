00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
I know that everybody's like,

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:02.601
so hurt and sad

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:05.921
cause sweet little Mike Tyson lost that fight to Jake Paul.

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:09.461
But can we please remember that Mike Tyson was a wife beater?

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.800
He was when he was in his heyday,

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:18.901
and he was Iron Mike Tyson.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.840
He was using that same strength and force

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:23.721
against the women he was with.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.240
there's probably a lot of women that could give no fucks that he won,

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:34.261
and they're probably happy that he.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.960
You know what I mean? Like,

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:37.341
there's so many people in this world that he hurt.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.920
So, you know,

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:43.001
before we go shedding a ton of tears for Mike Tyson.

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.981
I get it. I watched the fight too.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.360
Um, like,

00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:52.721
try to remember. That's why men will get away with stuff.

00:00:52.722 --> 00:00:53.561
They get older

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:57.081
and then we'll just forget everything they did and be like, oh,

00:00:57.082 --> 00:01:00.541
but it like, okay,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.380
he's a violent man that was violent his whole life,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.760
and violence is even a part of his end of days.

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:08.481
Like, I don't.

00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:09.681
I don't know, I don't know.

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:11.741
There's not a whole lot of sympathy.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.700
And he also got paid. Like,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.020
can we please save your tears for anything but Mike Tyson?
