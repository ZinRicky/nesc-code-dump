00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.240
Not to sound, like, really stupid,

00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:03.801
but is the Boston Marathon longer than the LA Marathon?

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:05.581
No. All marathons at the same length.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.160
That's like common sense,

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:11.461
I fear. Are you serious? I'm serious.
