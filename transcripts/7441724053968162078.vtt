00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
Okay. I'm currently pregnant with baby number two,

00:02.241 --> 00:03.681
and I wanna share, like,

00:03.682 --> 00:05.721
all the things that I take instead of a prenatal,

00:05.722 --> 00:07.001
because I always get asked,

00:07.002 --> 00:08.081
what prenatal do you take?

00:08.082 --> 00:10.981
I don't take a prenatal. I've never taken a prenatal.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.400
And actually, this pregnancy,

00:13.401 --> 00:15.161
I'm taking a lot more things than I was last time,

00:15.162 --> 00:17.361
because I know more information this time.

00:17.362 --> 00:19.121
I'm more informed. Um,

00:19.122 --> 00:21.481
but I do wanna say this is just.

00:21.482 --> 00:23.841
I'm not giving any advice or anything.

00:23.842 --> 00:26.001
It's just what I do and what works for me.

00:26.002 --> 00:27.601
Grass fed beef liver capsules,

00:27.602 --> 00:29.681
I cannot tolerate. I know beef liver.

00:29.682 --> 00:32.681
Like, you can eat actual beef liver.

00:32.682 --> 00:34.601
Like, I think it's like once or twice a week,

00:34.602 --> 00:35.681
mom, on of it will be good,

00:35.682 --> 00:37.641
but I just cannot tolerate beef liver at all.

00:37.642 --> 00:39.401
It's just. It's disgusting to me.

00:39.402 --> 00:42.281
So I do beef liver capsules have basically, like,

00:42.282 --> 00:43.901
all your vitamins, like,

00:44.000 --> 00:45.280
all your, um,

00:45.281 --> 00:47.781
B vitamins, vitamin A,

00:48.160 --> 00:50.480
all the good stuff. Then I take vitamin C.

00:50.481 --> 00:52.201
I typically take a different brand,

00:52.202 --> 00:54.681
but this brand sent me these,

00:54.682 --> 00:56.961
so I'm currently using. Vitamin C is just, like,

00:56.962 --> 00:57.921
so important for, like,

00:57.922 --> 01:00.341
the structure of babies, bones, teeth,

01:00.480 --> 01:02.480
immune system, things like that.

01:02.481 --> 01:04.541
So not all vitamin C is the same.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.360
Go to a regular store and you walk in,

01:06.361 --> 01:10.141
the most vitamin C that you'll see is from absorbent acid,

01:10.160 --> 01:11.320
which that's not what you want

01:11.321 --> 01:13.801
because that's an incomplete form of Vitamin C.

01:13.802 --> 01:17.041
You want a whole food form of vitamin C.

01:17.042 --> 01:19.281
Like, a bunch of brands out there.

01:19.282 --> 01:22.801
This one, the one from Perfect Supplements that I typically take free,

01:22.802 --> 01:25.321
basically freeze dried cherry. Um,

01:25.322 --> 01:28.301
and that's the complete form of vitamin C.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.760
Next, one of my favorites,

01:29.761 --> 01:31.801
which is cod liver oil. Um,

01:31.802 --> 01:35.141
I take this fermented cod liver oil from green pasture.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.520
Um, it's not have anything added or anything.

01:37.521 --> 01:38.681
And is it, like,

01:38.682 --> 01:40.541
any fillers or additives or anything?

01:40.640 --> 01:44.200
And then I take. I rotate cod liver oil with beef liver,

01:44.201 --> 01:45.781
since they both have vitamin A.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.400
I do, like,

01:46.401 --> 01:47.681
one day beef liver capsules,

01:47.682 --> 01:49.001
one day cod liver oil.

01:49.002 --> 01:52.441
But cod liver oil is so important because it has vitamin A,

01:52.442 --> 01:54.361
vitamin D, which is so,

01:54.362 --> 01:55.481
so important for, like, babies,

01:55.482 --> 01:57.421
brain development, eye development.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.960
Next thing that I take is.

01:59.961 --> 02:03.101
I don't even know if I'm gonna pronounce this right. Shilajit.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.580
It's basically full of minerals.

02:05.640 --> 02:09.760
Stay with this. You cannot start taking this if you are already pre.

02:09.761 --> 02:11.201
Like, if you haven't taken this before,

02:11.202 --> 02:13.621
you're pregnant. It has a detox effect.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.520
Another thing I take is bee pollen.

02:16.521 --> 02:18.081
I add this to my, like, smoothies,

02:18.082 --> 02:19.241
my daily smoothies and, like,

02:19.242 --> 02:20.641
protein shakes. Um,

02:20.642 --> 02:23.281
bee pollen has vitamins, copper.

02:23.282 --> 02:24.521
Only need a small amount of this.

02:24.522 --> 02:25.821
You don't wanna overdo it.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.080
Show powder. It sounds weird,

02:27.081 --> 02:29.161
but you won't taste it. I added to my shakes.

02:29.162 --> 02:30.521
I think I have a TikTok on, like,

02:30.522 --> 02:31.721
How I make this, it's super,

02:31.722 --> 02:33.421
super simple. I make it with eggshells,

02:33.600 --> 02:37.120
and I just add a tiny bit about my shakes,

02:37.121 --> 02:39.441
and it's really, really good for Calcium.

02:39.442 --> 02:40.821
Now let's talk about Bruce.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.240
Loaded with, like, thing, iron,

02:43.241 --> 02:44.701
phonium, selenium,

02:45.080 --> 02:47.160
B vitamins, and it has folate,

02:47.161 --> 02:49.081
which I don't take, folic acid.

02:49.082 --> 02:51.161
I only take folate. Um,

02:51.162 --> 02:51.801
I take it to, like,

02:51.802 --> 02:53.361
the foods that I eat. Obviously,

02:53.362 --> 02:53.721
I eat, like,

02:53.722 --> 02:55.821
a really good diet. Um,

02:56.040 --> 02:58.040
but on top of that, I do,

02:58.041 --> 02:59.801
like, to add Bruce yeast to, like,

02:59.802 --> 03:01.701
my chocolate chip cookies that I make.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.480
And then on top of that, I.

03:03.481 --> 03:05.641
I take this three times a week with water,

03:05.642 --> 03:09.661
a collagen every single day with my milk at night.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.160
Magnesium. I take magnesium glycinate.

03:12.161 --> 03:14.201
So magnesium helps convert, um,

03:14.202 --> 03:18.021
the storage form of vitamin D into the active form of vitamin D.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.160
So you need magnesium. This is just what works for me.

03:21.161 --> 03:22.881
I am planning to add a vitamin K,

03:22.882 --> 03:24.241
like, the last three months.

03:24.242 --> 03:25.161
I know it sounds like a lot,

03:25.162 --> 03:27.221
but a lot of the stuff I just add to my smoothies,

03:27.760 --> 03:30.100
and all the stuff I don't take every day,

03:30.400 --> 03:31.040
I take it, like,

03:31.041 --> 03:34.233
a couple times a week. So that's all.
