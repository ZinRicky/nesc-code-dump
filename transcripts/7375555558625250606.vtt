So apparently, a lot of parents are upset with this JoJo Siwa.

00:04.121 --> 00:06.681
You didn't know she was a little girl on the show Dance Mom?

00:06.682 --> 00:08.441
For a long time, she was this, like,

00:08.442 --> 00:11.881
child star. She had this line of bows for little girls.

00:11.882 --> 00:13.241
She had all this colorful stuff.

00:13.242 --> 00:14.121
And now she's getting older,

00:14.122 --> 00:15.081
and, like a lot of,

00:15.082 --> 00:16.801
you know, child celebrities,

00:16.802 --> 00:20.241
they have this rebrand when they become adults, where they become edgy

00:20.242 --> 00:20.881
and, you know,

00:20.882 --> 00:23.121
she has different songs that have, like,

00:23.122 --> 00:25.841
edgy music videos, and she, like, drinks. Anyway,

00:25.842 --> 00:27.681
a lot of parents are upset with her.

00:27.682 --> 00:28.481
They're saying, like,

00:28.482 --> 00:30.721
my children look up to you.

00:30.722 --> 00:32.001
Like, you are a role model.

00:32.002 --> 00:34.001
You're supposed to be a role model for these kids.

00:34.002 --> 00:34.801
When I was growing up,

00:34.802 --> 00:36.721
the big thing was Miley Cyrus.

00:36.722 --> 00:39.221
I remember the same kind of thing happening where she got older.

00:39.320 --> 00:39.960
People were like,

00:39.961 --> 00:40.921
oh, my goodness,

00:40.922 --> 00:41.641
this is horrible.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.641
What a horrible example.

00:42.642 --> 00:43.441
But I was like,

00:43.442 --> 00:44.721
I don't care. She's not my role model.

00:44.722 --> 00:46.161
She's just, like, this person on TV.

00:46.162 --> 00:46.961
And I like her songs.

00:46.962 --> 00:48.601
And that's as deep as it goes,

00:48.602 --> 00:52.081
and that's as deep as it should go for anybody with a celebrity,

00:52.082 --> 00:53.041
but especially,

00:53.042 --> 00:54.501
especially for a child.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.720
Say what you will about her,

00:55.721 --> 00:59.041
about how cringy these celebrities are and how you don't like them

00:59.042 --> 01:00.761
and how they're immoral and all that,

01:00.762 --> 01:02.001
I probably agree with you.

01:02.002 --> 01:03.761
But you should not be upset with Them

01:03.762 --> 01:05.721
for being bad role models for your children?

01:05.722 --> 01:08.521
Because they should not be role models for your children.

01:08.522 --> 01:12.161
Children's role models should be people they know in real life.

01:12.162 --> 01:15.801
This idea of worshipping celebrities so much

01:15.802 --> 01:17.861
that we become personally offended

01:17.920 --> 01:19.680
when they lead us astray

01:19.681 --> 01:22.081
or lead our children astray is ridiculous.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.721
Get your children off of TikTok.

01:23.722 --> 01:26.801
They should know nothing about JoJo Siwa's personal life.

01:26.802 --> 01:29.801
They should not care because you should be their role model.

01:29.802 --> 01:32.201
You should be the one that they look to for guidance

01:32.202 --> 01:34.361
for what is wrong and what is right.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.321
You are the one who is supposed to be doing that.

01:36.322 --> 01:38.201
If children are becoming confused,

01:38.202 --> 01:39.561
if they are being LED astray,

01:39.562 --> 01:42.761
it isn't the fault of some random person on TikTok.

01:42.762 --> 01:44.201
It is the fault of parents.

01:44.202 --> 01:45.721
Parents need to be stronger.

01:45.722 --> 01:47.981
Parents need to take charge of their children's lives

01:48.040 --> 01:49.769
far more than they do right now.
