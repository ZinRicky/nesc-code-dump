Poor women who cook have healthier diets than wealthy women who don't.

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.121
Rates of home cooking decline,

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:09.121
rates of obesity go up.

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:10.281
And then you have the industry

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:13.681
with marketing messages that are flattering our sense of business

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.181
and pleasantly telling us,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.840
you don't have time to cook.

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:18.261
You're too important.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.698
You're a loser.
