00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.720
Do you know the Republicans want to ban corn?

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:04.241
Huh? What?

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:05.161
Who are you? Oh,

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:07.961
I'm Project 2025. I'm everywhere.

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:10.581
Forget about doors, forget about privacy

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.120
if Trump wants to ban all the fun stuff

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:14.561
to make sure that you're not doing any of it.

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:16.161
I've heard this is just propaganda.

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:19.081
Republicans can't ban us from looking at women on the internet.

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:20.001
I mean, what are you gonna ban?

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:21.321
Only fans? Oh no,

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.781
they wanna make it a crime.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.640
Project 2025 literally says

00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:27.561
people who produce it and distributed should be imprisoned

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:28.521
on page No. 5.

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:30.221
It's a banger right out of the gate.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.240
Okay, but Trump and Project 2025 are not the same thing.

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:37.661
Most of the people who wrote Project 2025 work for Trump.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.220
I'll let you finish legally.
