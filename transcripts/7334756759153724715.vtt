00:00.400 --> 00:01.760
All right, let's talk about the Super Bowl,

00:01.760 --> 00:03.740
because I have so many thoughts,

00:04.000 --> 00:06.260
and I literally had to write things down

00:06.360 --> 00:08.900
because I have so many thoughts.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.520
My first year watching a Super Bowl,

00:11.520 --> 00:13.000
because I never watched this stuff.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.080
I know it's satanic,

00:14.080 --> 00:15.300
I don't watch it.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.600
Um, this is my first year watching it,

00:17.600 --> 00:20.780
and everything that I've always said and thought

00:20.840 --> 00:23.460
has been proven watching it.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.840
Number one is

00:25.840 --> 00:28.340
I noticed how all the players,

00:29.040 --> 00:30.280
um. Well, not all.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.800
There's one that doesn't do this,

00:31.800 --> 00:36.080
but all the players mentioned god always

00:36.080 --> 00:37.000
and not Jesus.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.480
They never mentioned Jesus.

00:38.480 --> 00:39.440
And if they do,

00:39.440 --> 00:40.720
the one player that did,

00:40.720 --> 00:43.720
they took out that part of the interview at the end

00:43.720 --> 00:45.680
where he mentioned Jesus. Um,

00:45.680 --> 00:47.840
they don't wanna tell you what god they're worshipping.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.840
They want you to think

00:48.840 --> 00:50.960
that they're worshipping the same god as you.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.200
So you're like, oh, my god.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.860
Yes. Like, no,

00:53.920 --> 00:54.800
it's not what you think.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.820
It's not the god that you think they're worshipping.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.200
Um, and that's why they.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.380
We just say god.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.160
So Brock Party actually

01:01.160 --> 01:02.380
was the one that,

01:02.760 --> 01:04.480
um, mention Jesus in his.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.620
In his interview.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.840
And of course,

01:06.840 --> 01:07.560
they cut in half.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.980
Of course they don't want you to see that. Of course.

01:10.040 --> 01:10.840
Of course they.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.300
They take that out.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.480
Did you guys see the upside down cross?

01:15.480 --> 01:16.520
That devil horns that.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.500
I spiced it

01:17.600 --> 01:19.280
because I clearly saw it.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.160
And I saw it,

01:20.160 --> 01:21.160
and I was Like, yep.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.320
Like, of course

01:22.320 --> 01:23.540
they're gonna try to

01:23.640 --> 01:24.920
once the cameras on them

01:24.920 --> 01:26.480
to do all this wicked stuff

01:26.480 --> 01:28.520
to show you, um,

01:28.520 --> 01:29.980
the god that they're worshipping,

01:30.160 --> 01:32.140
um, the devil.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.720
Um, of course.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.140
Like, of course they're gonna do that. Uh,

01:37.040 --> 01:38.240
there were so many signs,

01:38.240 --> 01:42.160
truly. Like, the halftime show was filled with signs.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.320
Satanic signs.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.300
Um, the red. There's such a devil.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.980
Um, there's an angel with fire around.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.660
There was so many signs.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.520
The Super Bowl Jesus commercial.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.560
Oh, my goodness,

01:54.560 --> 01:55.620
that commercial.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.480
That commercial that, um,

01:57.480 --> 01:57.840
it was like

01:57.840 --> 02:00.560
basically people washing other people's feet and saying,

02:00.560 --> 02:02.500
Jesus washed other people's feet

02:02.680 --> 02:04.220
to not spread hate or whatever.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.180
I have beef with that commercial.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.280
Um, first of all,

02:07.280 --> 02:10.980
Jesus washed his disciples feet. Um,

02:12.320 --> 02:13.200
not what it's.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.040
It's not about washing someone's feet, um,

02:16.040 --> 02:17.540
while they reject what,

02:17.560 --> 02:18.940
what god says.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.540
Um, it's because if you truly,

02:21.680 --> 02:22.940
truly love someone,

02:22.960 --> 02:24.480
you share the gospel with them.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.580
You don't just let them do,

02:26.800 --> 02:29.240
you know, do all this stuff and, like,

02:29.240 --> 02:30.740
not follow what god says.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.520
You preach them the gospel.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.600
You don't just wash their feet

02:33.600 --> 02:35.320
while they're doing all this crazy stuff.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.140
So I have beef with that commercial.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.580
My biggest thing,

02:38.920 --> 02:40.040
do not fear of this stuff.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.840
Do not feel anxious of this stuff.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.540
Because if you truly have Jesus in your life,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.160
you know, you have peace.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.820
Like, you have the peace that he brings.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.640
Um, and my biggest thing is

02:52.640 --> 02:53.860
Like this year,

02:54.480 --> 02:55.980
open your Bible. More like

02:56.400 --> 02:59.520
open your Bible more than you would use your phone.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.120
Like, every time you're gonna use your phone

03:01.120 --> 03:02.580
for something not important,

03:03.040 --> 03:03.800
go to your Bible.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.900
Read your Bible,

03:05.000 --> 03:05.920
get in the word of god.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.920
Because honestly,

03:06.920 --> 03:08.280
nothing's gonna bring you peace,

03:08.280 --> 03:09.760
especially in an election year

03:09.760 --> 03:13.980
where there's gonna be chaos as much as Jesus will. So.
