I decided to go ahead and buy this dress in a different color,

00:03.321 --> 00:04.881
have the pink and blue, and I love it,

00:04.882 --> 00:07.801
but I think I might like this one even more.

00:07.802 --> 00:10.081
Normally, I wear shapewear underneath dresses like this,

00:10.082 --> 00:12.961
but I'm not right now. You can tie it a bunch of different ways.

00:12.962 --> 00:13.841
So you could, like,

00:13.842 --> 00:15.721
untie these and do a criss cross thing.

00:15.722 --> 00:17.321
I've seen girls untie this and, like,

00:17.322 --> 00:19.841
tie up the. I think it's so pretty.

00:19.842 --> 00:21.641
It's very flattering, very,

00:21.642 --> 00:23.121
very comfy. I think it's perfect for,

00:23.122 --> 00:24.401
like, a summertime date night.

00:24.402 --> 00:25.941
At least that's where I've worn it.
