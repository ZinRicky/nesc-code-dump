00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.800
I'm not even making this up right now.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.880
I go to the gas station,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.440
I'm like, hey,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.120
can I do $40 and pump for.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.460
She's like, no. I go, why?

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.580
Out of gas. Out of gas?

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.160
The gas stations out of gas.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.300
How could that be?
