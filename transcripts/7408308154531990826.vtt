My husband loves the spicy snacks,

00:02.281 --> 00:05.441
so when he said he was craving Flaming Hot Cheetos today,

00:05.442 --> 00:09.661
I decided to make him some instead of him having to go to the store.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.840
I cooked my polenta, spread that out,

00:11.841 --> 00:16.161
let that cool for about two hours before adding it to a food processor

00:16.162 --> 00:17.801
alongside some egg whites,

00:17.802 --> 00:19.801
baking powder, cayenne, garlic,

00:19.802 --> 00:22.721
and then I gradually added in some cornstarch.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.241
Once it was a thick paste,

00:24.242 --> 00:26.321
I piped it onto my cutting board

00:26.322 --> 00:29.041
that was dusted with some air root powder

00:29.042 --> 00:33.381
before I cut that up and formed them into some Cheeto like shapes.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.720
Set those aside while my oil heated up,

00:35.721 --> 00:37.121
and once it was hot enough,

00:37.122 --> 00:39.761
I fried them until they were golden brown,

00:39.762 --> 00:42.041
transferred them over to a wire rack

00:42.042 --> 00:43.721
before popping that in the oven

00:43.722 --> 00:46.361
and letting that bake on my lowest heat setting

00:46.362 --> 00:48.121
for about four to five hours

00:48.122 --> 00:50.801
just until it was crispy and dried out.

00:50.802 --> 00:52.941
It was almost time to pull out my Cheetos.

00:53.040 --> 00:56.280
I started on making both my seasoning mixes.

00:56.281 --> 00:59.041
I decided to go with the original cheese flavor

00:59.042 --> 01:00.841
and then the flaming hot one.

01:00.842 --> 01:03.441
I tossed my Cheetos in both of the seasonings

01:03.442 --> 01:06.441
and lucky obviously went for the Hot Ones first,

01:06.442 --> 01:08.209
which were gone in less than 10 minutes.
