00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
August of 2,014,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.300
the body of Tina Fontaine, 15 years old,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.700
was discovered on the Red River.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.620
She was wrapped in a blanket,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.500
weighed down and thrown into the Red River.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.040
And when the police announced her discovery,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.160
the murder of this,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.500
of this young girl,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.740
for the first time in Winnipeg's history,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.340
perhaps even across the country,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.080
the lead investigator at the time,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.420
I think one of the reporters had asked,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.720
you know, like,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.080
how do you feel about this?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.940
And for the first time ever,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.520
a police officer,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.140
an investigator said,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.500
well, she was a child.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.100
We should all be enraged.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.120
It was kind of the first time that you saw emotion,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.200
but it was also

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.920
kind of the first time that you saw a police officer,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.860
investigator,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.540
a policing institution construct, um,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.000
one of our missing and murdered as a child,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.260
which she was.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.220
And what that did was it galvanized

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.740
certainly the public in Manitoba,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.660
but it also galvanized the public across the country.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.040
Her little face,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.160
her little innocent child face

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.980
was strewn all over media across the country.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.920
And because of that,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.140
there was this pressure on the government at the time

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.220
to call a national inquiry.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.200
Michelle Audet was part of that.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.480
A lot of us were a part of that.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.200
There was lots of indigenous women and families

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.880
across the country

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.740
that were calling for a national inquiry.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.940
In December of 2,014,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.880
the former prime minister,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.600
Stephen Harper,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.660
was interviewed by Peter Mansbridge

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.800
and Peter Mansbridge said to him,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.900
you're getting a lot of pressure.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.340
Are you looking at a national inquiry?

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.640
And the prime minister of Canada at that time said,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.800
well, honestly,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.100
it's not on our radar at this time.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.660
We'll have some ministers

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.500
talk to people that are concerned about this issue.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.320
In February of 2,015,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.240
because of that,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.140
because of Tina Fontaine,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.180
because of those cold and callous

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.260
words from a sitting prime minister

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.160
that was pressured to hold the first ever national

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.180
round Table

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.600
that was held in February of 2,015.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.200
It was here

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.340
held here actually in Ottawa.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.380
It was the first time that Canada

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.500
uh, and provinces and territories and indigenous um,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.760
uh, N a O's sat together alongside

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.040
uh, m, m, I, W, G

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.140
families and uh,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.740
indigenous women activists was the first time ever.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.720
At that meeting

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.720
if you will recall

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.500
around that same time,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.960
the minister responsible for Aboriginal affairs

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.740
was a man by the name of Bernard Del Gore.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.380
And what did he say

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.560
during all this time that was going on

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.600
Tina calls for national inquiry.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.740
What did he say?

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.380
He said, well,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.200
70% of the murders,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.360
the people that do the murders and steal

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.140
indigenous women are done by indigenous men.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.860
That was very intentional.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040
It was intentional

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.320
because he was trying to blame indigenous peoples and,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.760
and minimize the systemic system,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.200
systemic racism and systemic misogyny and anti

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.620
indigenous racism

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.680
so that it made Canada not culpable for what's going On

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.860
across the country

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.600
um fast forward to October 2,015

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.060
there's a change in government

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.360
there was an active um

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.360
coordination from families and indigenous women

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.580
to push the new government to call a national inquiry

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.500
December, I think it was December 5th or 6

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.880
uh 2 thousand uh

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.720
15 the new uh

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.140
federal government calls a national inquiry

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.140
and February 2,016 was the second national

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.120
round table on missing and murdered

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.160
indigenous women and girls

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.140
we hosted it in Manitoba.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.520
We had almost

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.840
I I can't remember and

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.720
and one of my colleagues that helped me uh

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.680
coordinate that

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.100
I think we had like 350

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.820
m m I W G 2 s families

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.680
and and uh uh

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.320
premiers and ministers

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.780
we had um all kinds of MPs attend that

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.560
and we started this work in a really good way

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.400
with the new government.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.960
We gave out

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.420
we gifted blankets to the families

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.260
um Carolyn Bennett sat in circle

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.560
uh with m m I W

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.600
G2 s families.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.320
I think we were there until midnight.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.860
We had a sharing circle

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.900
uh the national inquiry of course

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.340
why am I saying all of this?

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.720
I'm saying all of this

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.020
because I understand the frustration

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.240
but I also want us to

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.300
to remember and to recognize

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.860
that work is happening

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.540
and what's the theme

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.200
between all of that

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.060
and where we are today

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.660
is our women

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.600
is m m I W G2S families

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.060
it is our women

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.120
and m m I W

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.420
G2S Families

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.560
that have paved the way,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.180
planted the seeds,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.720
did the work with blood,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.920
sweat and tears

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.660
so that we are sitting here in 2,024

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.100
with the most ministers

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.740
that have ever come to a round table

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.120
with a new minister.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.680
And this is,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.120
listen, I, I'm an NDP.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.320
I'm not to, you know,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.360
to trying to prop up the Liberal government.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.320
But I do want to give props where props are deserved.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.820
We have a minister

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.200
who has sat with us on and off.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.080
He's a little bit busy,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.040
but sat with us for 48 hours

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.220
and has reiterated his commitment

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.280
to making things right

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.760
and to doing this work.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.520
So I, I just wanna say that,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.840
that, I know it's frustrating, but we,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.260
but we are moving in the right direction. And,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.360
and a perfect example of that,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.060
and this is my final comment,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.100
is Haley Rose,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.600
Tyler, George

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.340
and Samantha, Jack.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.500
These young ones are our future.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.780
You are our future leaders.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.360
And it is an honor to sit at this table

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.100
with each and every one of you.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.520
All of us at the table are so impressed with you.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.520
And we want you to know that we support you

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.900
and we love you. Thank you.
