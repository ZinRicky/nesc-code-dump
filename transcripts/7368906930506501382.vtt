00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.600
Aneen, good morning, everyone.

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:11.441
First and foremost,

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:16.601
I just want to acknowledge and welcome everyone here today

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:20.081
to this historic meeting for Manitoba

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:23.481
and for our people. I thought that it was really important

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.601
and our team thought that it was really important

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:29.801
to have our young ones starters off in a good way

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:31.881
because what we're discussing today

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:36.001
and what we're doing today is for our young ones

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.741
and for those next generations.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.780
This

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.060
meeting signals a pivotal shift

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.600
towards giving the due respect to First Nations leadership

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:58.841
as governments and towards honoring indigenous laws for our children

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:00.061
and our families.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.560
But the reality is

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:07.841
that our people have always known how to take care of our children,

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:09.201
always. So

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.361
the commitment that we're making is that

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:13.041
there's not gonna be any barriers

00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:15.041
or not gonna be any foot dragging,

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:15.841
there's not gonna be,

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:18.881
let me go talk to the bureaucracy or what have you.

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:21.701
When you step up to say we're assuming child welfare,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.960
you have a minister, you have a provincial government

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:31.061
that is going to move quickly and make sure that Anishinaabe kids,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.380
Anishinaabe kids, Dakota kids,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.200
Denay kids, Cree kids can grow up in Anishinaabe,

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:41.461
Anishinaabe, the quota,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.000
then a and Cree families. Let's govern in such a way

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.081
that we don't have to come back here in 20 years

00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:49.501
and apologize to this generation of children.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.600
We finally have a government in Manitoba that we can work with.

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:54.681
I think you could all agree.

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:57.621
With that, like this thing that we signed here today,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.140
this is gonna take teamwork.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.980
We have a lot of work to do.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.940
But this is literally the first time in our history in this province

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.340
that we have the means of getting this done.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.620
This is literally the first time.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.200
And so my solemn promise to everybody is that I am dedicated to that.

00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:24.481
My door is always open, my phone is always on,

00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:28.641
and I will always make myself available to everyone

00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:30.281
because at the end of the day,

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:32.381
the only thing that matters,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.040
not our titles, not how long we've been in these roles,

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:40.501
the only thing that matters is our children. That's all that matters.
