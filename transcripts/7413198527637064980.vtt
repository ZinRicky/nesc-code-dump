00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.080
after growing this

00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:02.468
I don't think I'm ever gonna look at 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:03.520
mushrooms the same way again

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:06.280
this is Maia Mycelium, my pet pink oyster mushroom

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:08.840
and she's giving birth for the second time this season

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:11.760
and unbeknownst to her I will eat her tasty babies

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.640
but that macabre storyâ€™s for another day

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:16.142
because for today all we need to know is that 

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:17.720
fungi are fkn fascinating

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:20.000
her full fruiting process only took five days

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.664
cause apparently mushrooms favour 

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:23.280
cell expansion over cell division

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.960
so essentially they're just inflating cells that they already have

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:26.948
which is wild

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.016
 I also don't know how to feel about the fact 

00:00:29.017 --> 00:00:30.680
that some mushrooms can solve puzzles

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:32.444
and I'm sure I don't need to remind you 

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:33.680
that they don't have a brain

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:36.640
apparently they have a long and complicated history with humanity

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:38.960
and may have even played a role in our consciousness

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:40.360
and of course we can't forget that

00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:42.264
more than 600 types can turn their

00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:43.720
 host into a literal zombie

00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:44.882
food for thought I guess
