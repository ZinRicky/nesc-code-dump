00:00.880 --> 00:05.100
This week we headed to Ireland for a little work trip.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.720
It was a series of a lot of flights.

00:08.721 --> 00:09.681
They were very long,

00:09.682 --> 00:13.421
and we were so exhausted by the time we finally got there.

00:13.520 --> 00:17.840
It took us about 36 hours to get to Ireland,

00:17.841 --> 00:20.901
but when we were flying in to the country,

00:20.960 --> 00:22.160
it was all worth it.

00:22.161 --> 00:27.461
The green pastures and the little farms were absolutely breathtaking.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.960
And then we got a rental car.

00:29.961 --> 00:33.081
As you know, they drive on the opposite side of the road here,

00:33.082 --> 00:37.521
so it was a terrifying experience for the first little bit,

00:37.522 --> 00:39.161
but Daniel handled it like a charm.

00:39.162 --> 00:41.241
I definitely did not want to tackle that.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.621
So, so glad Daniel was with me.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.960
Then we stopped for lunch at a little market.

00:45.961 --> 00:47.961
It was so beautiful.

00:47.962 --> 00:52.621
We got tucked into our Airbnb right as the sun was setting,

00:53.120 --> 00:55.640
and the views were absolutely stunning.

00:55.641 --> 00:57.761
Then we all kind of took a little nap.

00:57.762 --> 01:02.241
We were all so tired. The Airbnb kitchen was so cute.

01:02.242 --> 01:05.321
So we got up, it was like five thirty PM at this point.

01:05.322 --> 01:07.861
We drug ourselves to the grocery store,

01:08.440 --> 01:10.820
stocked our fridge with the essentials.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.080
Um, I love how in Europe,

01:14.081 --> 01:15.921
none of the eggs are washed,

01:15.922 --> 01:18.201
and so they keep them, um,

01:18.202 --> 01:20.421
on the shelves and not in the refrigerator.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.360
Then after that, we headed home.

01:22.361 --> 01:23.881
We kind of got lost,

01:23.882 --> 01:26.761
but they finally made it back to Airbnb and they have no idea.

01:26.762 --> 01:29.341
What time it is. But I'm definitely ready for bed.
