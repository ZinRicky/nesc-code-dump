00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.600
I want to talk about this comment

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.721
particularly where it says that not all men can provide this.

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:06.321
Cause that opens up a bigger conversation.

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:09.761
So, yes, I am immensely blessed the property we have, um,

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:11.001
with our situation, etcetera.

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.081
That being said, though,

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:13.041
yeah, it's true,

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.041
not all men are gonna be able to provide.

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:18.641
Which is why it is so important to be very choosey

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:20.721
and picky with who you marry.

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.321
Marriage is not something to take lightly.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.001
It is not just a piece of paper.

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.641
It is very, very serious.

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:30.121
I need to be looking at character of a man who wants to provide.

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:31.881
If you wanna be a chadwave, um,

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:33.221
homemaker, stay at home mom,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.040
you're gonna need a man who wants to provide that lifestyle to you.

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:39.921
I do think there is a lot of red flags to look for in men.

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:41.881
Not just the emotional dating side of things,

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:44.201
but also financial red flags on how do.

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:45.361
How good are they with their money?

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:47.221
So if you get past all that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.600
and you find a man that you really love and adore,

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:52.121
and you've gotten to know him well enough to marry him,

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:55.241
then if you cannot provide for you financially

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:56.721
right off the bat when you get married,

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.201
that is totally okay.

00:00:58.202 --> 00:00:59.281
And this is my reasoning.

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:00.321
When you start out,

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:03.321
you're not gonna be where you wanna be 30 years down the line.

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:05.361
And I feel like a lot of people go Into marriage, thinking, oh,

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:06.241
I'm gonna have this right away.

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:07.421
I'm gonna have this right away.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.840
But a lot of times,

00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:10.361
like when you first get married,

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.821
it's. It's a lot of working together,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.240
grinding it out together,

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.201
um, building the life you want together to get where you wanna be.

00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:20.361
And that might not be staying home right off the bat.

00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:22.321
And it may look like a lot of years of hard work,

00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:23.361
penny pinching,

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:25.401
etcetera, to actually be able to stay home.

00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:27.681
That's why it's so great to be a help meet to a husband,

00:01:27.682 --> 00:01:30.241
because it doesn't always just look like being home.

00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:31.281
That looks like, maybe,

00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:34.201
how can I earn income so that we get out of this set amount of debt?

00:01:34.202 --> 00:01:35.121
Or something like that,

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:36.121
that I can stay.

00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:39.041
All in all, be very choosey with who you marry.

00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:40.601
If they are not gonna be a provider,

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:42.621
if you don't see them being a provider,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.060
um, don't marry them.
