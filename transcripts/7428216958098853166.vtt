00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.727
People always get so mad at me when I say “I love when I let my partner lead”

00:00:04.728 --> 00:00:06.449
why does it affect you? 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.167
it doesn't

00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:11.467
Not only that I'm happy I love when I listen to my man and do what he says

00:00:11.468 --> 00:00:13.587
and not in an oppressive toxic way

00:00:13.588 --> 00:00:15.027
but in a he's smart

00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:17.387
I trust his judgment I trust his character

00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:19.947
and generally he has my best interest at heart

00:00:19.948 --> 00:00:21.507
so why wouldn't I listen to him?

00:00:21.508 --> 00:00:23.067
why wouldn't I let him lead?

00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:24.827
if you are with the right man

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.866
you will follow him blindly wherever he leads you
