00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.526
my husband made breakfast for the 

00:00:01.527 --> 00:00:02.560
whole family this morning

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:03.987
which is another way of saying 

00:00:03.988 --> 00:00:05.000
my husband made a mess

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.546
so we have a system in my house where 

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:07.360
the person who cooks

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:08.520
doesn't have to do the dishes

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:10.360
even though this rule kinda backfires on me

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:12.600
cause I was always raised to clean up as I go

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.200
but I digress and if you know me

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:16.800
you know I dedicate a ridiculous amount of hours each week

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.560
just trying to stay on top of the housework

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.440
and I'm always looking for ways to make it quicker

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.200
more effective and less tedious if I'm honest

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:24.400
and about halfway through last year

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:26.537
I stumbled across these Finish Ultimate Plus 

00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:27.440
dishwashing tablets

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:28.880
and honestly they're worth the hype

00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:30.534
because Finish Ultimate Plus is so 

00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:32.000
effective at cleaning my dishes

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.040
I don't even need to pre rinse them anymore

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:35.040
if you're anything like me

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:36.640
you'll know what a game changer that is

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:39.080
I always get asked on my cleantoks what this little thing is

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:40.280
it's a dishwasher freshener

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:42.360
it smells really good and it lasts for ages

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:43.863
and I popped it in along with my 

00:00:43.864 --> 00:00:45.640
Finish Rinse Aid and dishwashing tablet

00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:47.800
and after my dishwasher was out here doing the most

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.807
it's time for the moment of truth to see how 

00:00:49.808 --> 00:00:51.280
Finish dealt with my dirty dishes

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:53.672
and I'm not even surprised that there is no trace of the 

00:00:53.673 --> 00:00:56.080
hard crusty egg yolk or baked on chocolate oats

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:58.880
the glassware is sparkling and the stainless steel is so shiny

00:00:58.881 --> 00:00:59.958
it's a big yes from me
