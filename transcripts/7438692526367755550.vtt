00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.240
Okay, here's my favorite thing about this calendar

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:05.561
is it gives you little reminder.

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:06.361
So it says,

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:11.901
buy mom a damn card and a gift the Friday right before Mother's Day.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.080
Actually, it's a fucking week before Mother's Day,

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.721
so it gives you time. And then it says,

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:17.041
call your mother. Love it.

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:19.341
That there's some days that are just

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.280
clearly halfway through the Fucking Week.

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:24.121
Like, there's just constant little reminders.

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:25.081
Same thing with Father's Day.

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:27.941
It says, buy your dad a fucking card

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.360
because it's gonna be Father's Day.

00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:31.641
And it gives you, like,

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:33.521
all the funny reminders of things.

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:36.401
Pancake Day, Guacamole Day.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:39.741
There's all kinds of funny little reminders of holidays.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.900
Best part,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.420
there's little stickers in the back for you to make it yourself.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.340
Make your own little shit in the calendar.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.640
Love it, love it,

00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:50.361
love it. Let's see what it says for Christmas.

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.521
Look at Christmas lights, you festive bitch.

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:53.561
I love it. It's super funny.

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:54.847
I love it. It's linked here if you want one.
