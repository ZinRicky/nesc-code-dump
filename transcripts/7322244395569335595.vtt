00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.420
Texas continues to take issue with its basic requirement to save women's lives

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.480
here's the latest

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.201
Texas is suing the department of health and Human Services

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:10.801
over what you might think

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:14.441
is non controversial guidance from the department of health and Human Services

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:18.081
but no so Texas is suing over this guidance

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:21.721
if a physician believes that a pregnant patient comes to the er

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.021
with an emergent medical condition

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.220
and an abortion would stabilize that patient's condition

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.300
then the physician must provide the treatment

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.640
oh no no no no says Texas

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:34.441
here's what's going on

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.281
there's a federal law from the 90s

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:40.521
called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act: EMTALA

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:43.201
EMTALA basically tells hospitals that look

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:46.061
if a patient comes to your hospital into the er

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.400
you need to screen them

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.241
and if they have an emergency condition

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:52.981
you either need to transfer them to an appropriate hospital

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.080
or you need to stabilize them

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:56.321
so after Dobbs came out

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:59.921
the department of health and Human Services had a sneaking suspicion that red

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:03.401
states were going to start denying pregnant women life saving care

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:04.881
so they sent out this guidance

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:06.321
basically being like

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:07.401
hey red states

00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:09.361
like we see your total abortion bans

00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:11.081
but we're just trying to remind you

00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:14.761
that you have certain federal obligations to save women's lives

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:16.041
so if a woman comes in

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.801
and an abortion would stabilize her

00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:19.761
when she has an emergency medical condition

00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:21.901
you have federal obligations to do that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.440
so Texas sue is over that

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:26.361
because it doesn't want to have to comply with that guidance

00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:29.441
it wants its state abortion law to control

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:30.201
because its state

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:33.641
abortion law is much narrower than that guidance

00:01:33.642 --> 00:01:35.821
and I'm gonna save you the legal nitty gritty

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.720
unless you want it

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:38.041
then tell me in the comments

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:39.061
but basically

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.560
the 5th Circuit agreed with Texas

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:46.241
meaning that if a pregnant Texan woman shows up to the emergency room

00:01:46.242 --> 00:01:50.021
and an abortion is what she needs to stabilize her care

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.860
that is not allowed in Texas

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.280
and we're seeing the same litigation out of Idaho

00:01:55.281 --> 00:02:00.561
and I just want to make clear how dehumanizing and humiliating it is

00:02:00.562 --> 00:02:05.881
to have states debating if and when they have to save our lives

00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:08.081
like I feel so gross

00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:11.021
disgusted and humiliated reading these pleadings

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.000
so at the bare minimum

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:14.401
I just wanna make sure that women understand

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:16.521
and know that this is litigation that is going on

00:02:16.522 --> 00:02:18.121
states in the United States

00:02:18.122 --> 00:02:22.121
are actively arguing about when they have to save your life

00:02:22.122 --> 00:02:24.001
or provide stabilizing care for you

00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:25.621
because they don't want to
