Welcome to an episode of what my kids didn't eat in their Lunch Box.

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:07.781
Because I see so many people saying what my kids eat in a day,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.880
but the real truth of it is what my kids didn't eat

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:12.321
because my kids don't eat.

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:14.441
So I just pack lunches for no reason,

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:18.721
don't I? We've got shit.

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:20.181
Okay, on her sandwich,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.780
we've got whole packet of these uneaten course.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.940
She actually ate her yoghurt today,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.320
some ham and cheese little pieces and two Oreos.

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:36.261
So not bad. Yeah.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.800
So can we start being a little bit more honest with these

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:39.841
what my kids eat in a day?

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:42.121
Because be honest, your kids don't eat

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:44.301
cause mine don't and I know yours don't either.
