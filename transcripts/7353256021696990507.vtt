00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.320
You wanna know what women really value most?

00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.441
Something that you as a man can do

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:09.201
and any woman will value you for this.

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:11.801
Protect us, keep us safe!

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:14.241
So simple, if you simply

00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:17.561
number one: lock the doors at your house

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:19.883
if your wife/girlfriend/partner 

00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:24.601
whoever it may be is in the house and you're heading out the door,

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:26.041
make sure you lock the door.

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:29.521
It means that she knows that you wanna keep her safe.

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.461
Women are innately always on high alert,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.980
and they worry about their safety probably more than men do.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.840
Men probably don't even consider this.

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:39.721
If your woman is at home alone,

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:40.601
lock the doors

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:43.121
or at night lock the doors.

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.181
Double check.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.067
Make sure those doors are locked in order to keep your wife safe 

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:48.481
Womea/partner

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:49.241
whatever it may be.

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:53.681
This world is so crazy that you never know what's going to happen,

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:57.241
so why not take the extra measure just to lock the door?

00:00:57.242 --> 00:01:01.401
That is what any woman wants, that's security.

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.881
You make her feel safe and protected.

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:06.081
You shouldn't complain or you shouldn't say,

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:07.441
“oh I forgot I'm sorry”

00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:11.880
Set it as a habit so she always feels safe.

00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:13.041
If she doesn't feel safe,

00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:15.321
then got bigger or worries.

00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:19.081
Your job is to protect us and keep us safe.

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:20.041
it's so simple.

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:22.881
So next time you're heading out the door,

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.001
make sure you lock it.

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:27.961
and females it's not too much to ask to have them lock the doors.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:32.081
So don't feel bad for having them worry about your safety.

00:01:32.082 --> 00:01:33.321
This should be a no brainer.

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:36.708
All men should do this without complaining or griping about it.
