00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:08.681
PDF versions are available online

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:10.121
the first time I read that book

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:12.281
it was a PDF and I had it on my phone

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:13.761
and I would literally be like

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:15.281
reading it while he was next to me

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.741
and then I would be getting scared cause I'd be like

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.600

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:22.841

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:23.721

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:24.841

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:26.121

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:27.301
he says he's that

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.400
then how come he knows how to not scream at his fucking boss

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:31.521
when his boss says something

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:33.881
how come when you're out at a restaurant and somebody does something

00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:35.881
he never acts this way in public

00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:37.981
he knows what the fuck he's doing

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.400
