00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
Definitely

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.140
manipulation and control happening in a lot of those churches.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.480
For sure. I saw an abuse of power a lot.

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.741
I've seen a lot of things.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.720
I'll give you an example. I have vivid memory of being at this.

00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:16.521
This church we were visiting,

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:19.661
and one of the things they're against is beards.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.100
Men can't wear beards.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.240
I know you believe that. My husband has a beard,

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:26.761
so it's. It's.

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:30.021
It's a whole thing. I would look like a seven year old without a beard.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.760
So they're all just clean shave?

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:33.041
Yes, it's a thing.

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:36.321
So I always say, I guess Jesus wouldn't be allowed in your church,

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:38.361
because, you know, yeah,

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:40.641
Jesus had a beard, so that's a whole different conversation.

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:42.701
But they had this thing against beards.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.380
And there were these two guys

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.860
that had been kind of in and out of the church,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.900
and they had beards. From the pulpit,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.480
the pastor at the end of the service,

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:55.701
calls these two guys to the front

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.040
and tells them to go shave that rebellion off of their faces.

00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.741
In front of the entire church.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.200
I remember being absolutely horrified.

00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:05.761
You were in the crowd? Yeah,

00:01:05.762 --> 00:01:08.441
I was sitting there watching all this up.

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:09.601
And I was friends with these guys.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.001
Like, I knew these guys,

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:15.001
and it never sat right with.

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.561
I think even then I was probably 18.

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:19.061
Yeah. I was like,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.687
no.
