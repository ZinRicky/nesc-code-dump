00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
These just came in the mail,

00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:02.041
and I'm very excited to use them

00:00:02.042 --> 00:00:06.121
because they are replacements for the O cedar spin mop mop heads,

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:07.241
which, if you know,

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:08.201
and if you have, you know,

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:11.841
they're very expensive, but I just got a pack of three of these for,

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:13.081
like, the price of one.

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:17.481
They look and they feel the same exact way as the O cedar ones,

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:18.733
so get them while you can.
