I got this cozy sweater on the TikTok shop.

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:05.181
It's linked right here. And as someone who lives in Colorado,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.500
I highly recommend this sweater.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.960
Also love it. As a mom,

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:10.201
this is truly like a blanket.

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:11.481
If you're going out with your kids

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:13.121
and it's like a festival or something,

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:16.481
like a fall festival or like anything that you're going out to do,

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:19.121
you know you're gonna have little ones in a stroller and you're like,

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:21.001
fuck, I don't wanna pack too much but not have enough.

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.501
This sweater could be like a sweater,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.240
a little blanket for them and their stroller.

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.685
Like this thing is highly recommend.
