When my husband and I were in Germany,

00:02.001 --> 00:05.561
we had the worst pumpkin cinnamon roll we've had in our lives.

00:05.562 --> 00:08.601
When I got home, I decided to just make it myself.

00:08.602 --> 00:10.121
Since it's pumpkin season,

00:10.122 --> 00:13.801
there's no better time. Deseeded and roasted my pumpkin

00:13.802 --> 00:17.081
before scooping all the flesh into my food processor

00:17.082 --> 00:21.321
and letting that puree. Then moved on to making my cinnamon roll dough

00:21.322 --> 00:23.481
by combining some warm milk, yeast,

00:23.482 --> 00:24.921
pumpkin puree, egg,

00:24.922 --> 00:25.881
and some butter,

00:25.882 --> 00:29.601
giving that a good mix before adding all of my dry ingredients.

00:29.602 --> 00:32.001
Let that knead for about eight to 10 minutes,

00:32.002 --> 00:33.681
and once it all came together,

00:33.682 --> 00:37.221
I let my dough rise for about an hour hour and a half.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.740
In the meantime, I made my brown sugar and cinnamon mixture.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.600
Once my dough had doubled in size,

00:42.601 --> 00:44.521
I turned it out, rolled it out,

00:44.522 --> 00:46.161
and spread it with some butter.

00:46.162 --> 00:48.081
Once the butter was evenly spread,

00:48.082 --> 00:51.341
I sprinkled my dough with my cinnamon and sugar mixture.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.440
Make sure to rub that in before rolling it up.

00:54.441 --> 00:57.081
Then cut my dough into even pieces

00:57.082 --> 00:59.761
and placed it into a buttered baking dish,

00:59.762 --> 01:01.281
making sure that they were close

01:01.282 --> 01:04.841
but not too close so they had enough space to expand.

01:04.842 --> 01:06.881
Let those rise for another hour,

01:06.882 --> 01:08.281
and once they look like this,

01:08.282 --> 01:10.881
I pop them in the oven for about 20 minutes.

01:10.882 --> 01:14.581
I got started on my salted maple cream cheese frosting.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.160
Combine some cream cheese,

01:16.161 --> 01:17.481
maple syrup, butter,

01:17.482 --> 01:18.801
vanilla, powdered sugar,

01:18.802 --> 01:22.441
and A huge pinch of salt. Let that whisk until smooth

01:22.442 --> 01:25.401
before spreading it all over my cinnamon rolls.

01:25.402 --> 01:27.281
My husband likes a lot of frosting,

01:27.282 --> 01:31.641
so I made sure to do that for cutting him one while it was still warm.

01:31.642 --> 01:33.521
Never been a huge fan of pumpkin,

01:33.522 --> 01:35.401
but these were divine and lucky.

01:35.402 --> 01:39.461
I love them and gave them a 9 out of 10 which says a lot.
