00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.620
Wait,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.080
but actually wait. Because if Trump is elected back into office,

00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:08.321
then his administration

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:11.521
is supportive of cutting funding to essential services

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:12.961
like service, Social Security,

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:16.561
which is known for helping disabled workers and retirees.

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:18.201
Meaning that retirement

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:22.021
probably not gonna be possible for a lot of working Americans.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.480
You see, instead

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:24.821
the Trump administration

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.400
is supportive of giving tax cuts to the ultra wealthy.

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:29.921
You know, that top 1%.

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:31.481
And this has been sold to all of us

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:34.001
as an imperative way of boosting the economy,

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:37.801
but all its done is further widen the income inequality gap.

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:40.121
So I guess what I'm asking you is

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:41.481
before you go to the polls,

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:44.641
take a second wait and make sure that you have all the facts

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:46.344
about what you're actually voting for.
