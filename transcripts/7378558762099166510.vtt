00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
I used to feel super guilty when I wasn't with my kids either,

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.681
and feel like I shouldn't be having fun,

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.121
I shouldn't be doing anything.

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:09.841
But you know what I started to do was tell my kids about what I did.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.121
Like, when they come back,

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:14.841
I want them to know Mommy's still a person and has a life.

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:15.921
And so I'll be like,

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.221
guess what I did?

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.880
Mommy went to the movies, or Mommy went to a concert,

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.481
or Mommy did this or Mommy did that.

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:23.801
And when I look at it as a way that I can bond with them,

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:24.801
that I can get them,

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:26.161
you know, like, that object permanence.

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:29.441
Like, just cause you're gone doesn't mean mommy's life stops.

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:30.681
Mommy totally has a life.

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:33.641
Like, I've gone to travel while they're gone.

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:36.361
I've gone to New York City and come back with souvenirs like, hey,

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:37.561
well, you guys were at Dad's house.

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:39.161
I was in a whole another state.

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.001
I wasn't even anywhere near you guys.

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:42.381
Isn't that cool?

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.200
And so I use it as an opportunity to show them that mommy has a life.

00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:47.721
You know what I mean?

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:48.721
That Mommy is a person.

00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:50.581
Mommy has other things she can do.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.580
And then I look,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.240
I. You.

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:55.401
I look at the time when they're away

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:57.741
as an opportunity to do something cool

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.280
to talk to them about.

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.561
So, um,

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:03.721
I don't know, maybe you. Could you do that a little bit to help?

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:05.041
Because you Know,

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:06.641
it doesn't help you or the kids

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:08.441
to stay sad the whole time they're gone.

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:10.241
Especially when they're gone for five days,

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:16.281
seven days. It's only gonna draw the time out longer and exhaust you.

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:17.241
And that's the goal.

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:21.801
The goal is to drain you of all of your love and support.

00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:22.361
But the thing is,

00:01:22.362 --> 00:01:23.481
you're not a narcissist.

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:26.361
You don't receive all of your fucking energy

00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:28.661
from someone else's supply.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.080
You can just create energy.

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:33.201
You can create happiness and love.

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:34.901
Like, you can do that for yourself.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920
So lean into that.

00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:39.261
And it really helps when the kids are
