00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.520
Actually, it very much isn't.

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:06.721
If it's anyone's job to teach sons how to eventually be husbands,

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:08.321
partners, boyfriends,

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:10.621
fathers, it's the dads.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.420
Because no matter what I say as a mother to two sons,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.000
my boys are watching my husband and watching our interactions

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.001
and watching how he shows up.

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:22.881
And that is gonna be 10 times more impactful than any sort of, like,

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:26.821
storybook, after school special lesson I could be giving him them.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.440
It always flabbergasts me.

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.561
In whatever conversation we're talking about,

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:34.081
we blame the mother because we can't possibly,

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:37.981
as a society, hold men accountable for the circumstances

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.120
and the outcomes of their action

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:43.501
or inaction. This is a male issue.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.760
And if you see your son acting up,

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:50.261
it is the father that should be checking him and correcting him.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.300
Let's stop putting all of the labor to raise an entire society

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.220
on only mothers. Dads need to step up.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.380
And this is a very good place where they can.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.340
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
