00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.120
As me and river were leaving the farm to go to ballet,

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:06.441
um, this was by the driveway gate.

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:09.241
So while she's in ballet and I'm waiting for her to be done,

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.261
I thought I would unbox it with you.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.420
This is a set of 12 glass storage containers.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.000
We make about 90% of our food from scratch on the farm.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.521
I'm not saying that we everything from scratch,

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:20.621
because that's just ridiculous.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.600
But I wanna make our lifestyle as non toxic as possible.

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:29.381
So when storing the food that I spend so much time making,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.740
it's really important that we have glass food containers.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.640
Four years ago, I threw all of our plastic containers away.

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:39.201
So I only store food in either mixing bowls with foil

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:41.361
or a cloth over them, or I use, um,

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:43.041
glass containers like this.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:46.001
But I saw this glass container set and I just had to have it.

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:47.421
Like, look at these. Cute.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.880
They're all different sizes.

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.361
I really like how they have, like,

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:51.721
a fluted edge to them,

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:54.681
and there's different sizes perfectly sized for that.

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:55.961
Like, I have small things I make,

00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:57.841
like small dairy products I make sometimes,

00:00:57.842 --> 00:00:58.441
like sour cream.

00:00:58.442 --> 00:01:01.301
I don't make a lot of that cause the kids don't eat a lot of it.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.580
Many other SUVs. It's freaking me out.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.720
It's like a competition. Who is the best SUV,

00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:09.681
the newest SUV? Are you a black SUV mom,

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:11.381
or are you a white SUV mom?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.280
And I Still use plastic lids with Mason jars

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.961
because the food doesn't actually touch the plastic.

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:17.601
Like the lid here, the food doesn't actually touch the lid.

00:01:17.602 --> 00:01:19.281
So let's get the rest of them out.

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:22.501
They have good packaging, so the other ones are inside.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.420
Go to all that time and effort to make your food from scratch.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.720
Don't store in plastic.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:33.381
Make sure you're storing your food in direct contact with glass.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.400
I'm gonna be using these now in the kitchen

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:38.041
instead of using mixing bowls of rags at the top.

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:39.781
We don't have a lot of leftovers,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.280
but I will be using these more for stuff that I'm making

00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:46.521
and I wanna preserve. More for preserving food than storing food,

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:49.401
because we don't have many leftovers,

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:52.721
and we honestly feed our dogs most of the leftovers, um,

00:01:52.722 --> 00:01:54.561
because I believe that dog

00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:57.321
feeding human great food is better than eating dog kibble.

00:01:57.322 --> 00:01:58.681
These are perfect for any kitchen.

00:01:58.682 --> 00:02:01.081
If you're just starting out cooking from scratch,

00:02:01.082 --> 00:02:02.521
or even doing it for years,

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:03.721
even if you don't cook from scratch,

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:06.821
and you want to store your leftovers that you spend time cooking,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.280
then these are perfect for that.

00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:09.921
To wash it safe, BPA free,

00:02:09.922 --> 00:02:13.521
and lead free. If you're gonna buy any or use any food containers,

00:02:13.522 --> 00:02:15.840
I highly, highly suggest that you use glass ones.
