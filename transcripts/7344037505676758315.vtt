00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.960
a lot of women commented on the little skit that I did like oh

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:03.961
I can't believe I did that

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:05.461
blah blah blah like this

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.660
do not beat yourself up

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.480
it's not your fault when you get involved with somebody like that

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:14.181
they fucking manipulated you

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.540
they used their children as a fucking tool

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.960
to get you to use your heart and empathy and be there

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:27.821
you what you did what you thought was a good thing

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.560
then in Hindsay

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:31.041
you're able to look back and say

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.201
gosh that was silly

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:33.241
I shouldn't have done that

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.121
I don't know why I participated in that way

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:36.161
so you have growth

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:39.061
so don't beat yourself up over something you did in the past

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.080
because that's not gonna serve you in the future

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:43.981
and all you can do is just be a vocal voice to help

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.560
women never make that mistake again

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.521
so thank you for adding to the conversation

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:48.881
thank you for validating that yes

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.281
there are women that gets trapped in these relationships

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:53.241
and pay their child support

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:55.021
and none of them are stupid

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.254
they're being abused
