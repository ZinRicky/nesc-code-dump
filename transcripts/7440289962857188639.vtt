00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.920
It's time for brutally honest review of Ballerina Farms meat.

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:05.601
And you guys had a lot of thoughts and feelings about their pastry box,

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:07.081
so I can only imagine how this is gonna go.

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:08.521
I really wanted to try a filet,

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:09.441
but they were out of stock,

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.281
so I ended up getting a rib eye and short ribs.

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.161
I also wanted to try their garlic and herb salt,

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:14.521
so I got that as well. And as you can see,

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:17.161
the subtotal was ninety two dollars and forty eight cents for shipping

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:19.561
being $46, which was pretty crazy to me.

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:21.001
Which was made frustrating by the fact

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:22.561
that it did not ship for six days.

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:24.201
I can understand a few days of processing,

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:26.921
but paying $46 for shipping that should be one to two days

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:30.161
and having to wait over a week to receive it is way too much to me.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.841
Anyway, starting off with the garlic and herb salt.

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:34.881
I really enjoyed this. Do I think it's overpriced for $17?

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:36.401
Yeah, but if you have the money to splurge,

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:38.321
I definitely think a higher quality salt,

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:40.421
especially one with so much flavor like this,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.240
can be worth it. It's described as hand harvested,

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.761
unrefined mineral sea salt with organic herbs including basil, garlic,

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:47.041
leek, margarine, parsley,

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.441
Rosemary and seaweed. But now onto the star of the show,

00:00:49.442 --> 00:00:51.001
which is these beautiful short ribs.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.561
I braised these in red wine and bone broth for about three hours.

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:54.521
I wish I'd done It longer

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:57.241
because they were not as pull apart as I wanted them to be in the end.

00:00:57.242 --> 00:00:58.721
And I don't blame the meat for this,

00:00:58.722 --> 00:00:59.881
I just blame my impatience.

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:01.401
I did find the short were pretty fatty,

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.761
and I know that is relatively normal for this cut of meat,

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:06.001
but I just felt like at the end I was digging through a lot

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:07.241
lot of fat to get to the actual.

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:09.001
Overall though, I did enjoy the short rib.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.561
It tasted like good quality meat,

00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:12.841
but I really struggle to say that it's worth the price point,

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:14.961
especially with how crazy the shipping is.

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:17.641
Unless you have absolutely no access to good quality meat

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:18.161
where you live.

00:01:18.162 --> 00:01:20.643
Stay tuned because I'm gonna review the rib eye in a separate video.
