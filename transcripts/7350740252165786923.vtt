00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.440
you don't like

00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:03.961
sit down and fucking tell your kid and teach them how to talk right

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:04.681
you just like

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:05.961
have a baby you hold it

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:07.921
it like lives life with you

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:10.641
and eventually it starts to learn how to talk and walk and like

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:11.321
be a part of your life

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.480
you play around and shit

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:14.361
but they learn this

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:18.321
we all learn this whole fucking language just by just being around

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:18.881
doing it right

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:21.261
well that is exactly how your child learns love

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.540
however you guys conduct love and relationship in your home

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.700
that's just the vibe your kids gonna pick up

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.100
you don't have to make it really known that you guys argue behind closed doors

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.820
because you keep it real icy in front of them

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.360
you know what I mean

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:39.241
like they're just gonna pick up the general vibe

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:43.261
they're gonna understand what love and relationships are

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.860
because of the home that they live in

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.220
so if you would be happy for your child to grow up and end up in a marriage

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.360
and a relationship like the one you're in continue

00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:56.161
like it or not

00:00:56.162 --> 00:00:58.461
your children are watching and learning
