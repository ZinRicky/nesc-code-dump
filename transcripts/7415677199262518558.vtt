00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.520
Fucking truly, don't have them if you're not ready to beat ass for them.

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:10.861
These days, people get stupid disrespectful with your kids.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.300
Stupid disrespectful with your kids.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.600
People give you stupid fucking looks when you're out with your kids.

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:20.781
It is not well received, not welcome.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.640
But I don't know why there's this big push to.

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:27.541
For people to have kids. Because when you go out in the world with kids,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.620
it's like you are just the bane of everyone's existence.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.760
It feels shitty. You have to kinda,

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:40.001
as mom, like block all that energy for them and be like, no,

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:41.361
you guys can have fun, it's okay.

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:42.281
It's okay that you're here,

00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:43.681
we're allowed to be here. Like,

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:47.401
there's so much trying to convince your children it's okay

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:50.521
when all these big scary adults are like

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:54.561
clearly so annoyed and angry that they even fucking exist

00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:56.641
and have the nerve to be out in public.

00:00:56.642 --> 00:01:03.041
So for fucking real, if you're not made of the thickest fucking skin,

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:07.141
ready to beat ass for your fucking babies,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.800
don't have them. Just save yourself and everyone the trouble,

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:15.121
cause you're gonna raise little kids that get walked over

00:01:15.122 --> 00:01:17.361
because you're not willing to stand up for them.

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:19.381
You're gonna put that it's. Just

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.440
think about everything before you have children,

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:24.841
including

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:28.924
and especially the world and society you're bringing them into.
