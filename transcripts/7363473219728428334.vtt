00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.760
this is how we make fresh pickles every summer

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:04.461
one of my kids favourite snacks

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.280
first of all I'm gonna go out to the garden and pick some of my ripe

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:08.641
ready to go cucumbers

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.141
and I'm also gonna grab some fresh dill

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.640
now I'm gonna take this into the kitchen

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:19.041
and I'm gonna get some vinegar and water

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:21.461
and boil that on the stove and add some salt

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.520
I'm then gonna slice the cucumbers up into spears

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:27.861
this is the favourite way the kids like to eat them

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.140
and I'm gonna make sure they'll fit inside the jar

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.560
then I'm gonna pack them in tightly

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:35.301
just like how I would if I was going to can them

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.140
see I can pretty much get no more in here and then you're good

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.380
then I'm gonna pour that hot vinegar brine over the pickles

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.840
sorry cucumbers

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:51.981
they will be pickles

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.840
and then I'm gonna put those in the fridge and after about a week

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:56.721
they are pretty much pickled and ready to eat

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.101
they're absolutely delicious and the kids love them
