00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.480
I’m gonna be honest okay

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:03.581
please don't tell the new age feminist this

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.180
but I would 100% rather stay home,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.620
cook and clean

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.520
100% rather do that okay

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:14.961
I love to cook and I love to clean and organize

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:17.481
Shh feminists shh, I know okay

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:21.941
But I love to cook good food and I love to clean and I love to do it for my man

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.480
truly I do, however,

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.741
if that's expected outside of marriage

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.040
hard pass that actually sounds like you're taking care of a child

00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.861
but the look on a man's face

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.160
when you cook for him,

00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:33.001
clean for him,

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.901
do anything to please him,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.840
that's what it's all about.

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:40.761
watching him admire you with his blissfully happy eyes

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:42.701
it just, it melts your heart

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.520
There’s just something in me as a woman

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:50.001
that makes me feel like this whole traditional/wife living isn't such a terrible thing

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.141
why did we actually want to work?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.740
what was the idea or perspective of pursuing a career?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.970
there’s nothing more satisfying than having a man that takes care of you 

00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:01.481
A true gentlemen

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.041
that provides for you,

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.101
you don't have to worry about anything

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.040
if you do that,

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:07.681
I'll cook and clean all day!

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:08.921
why would I complain?

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:13.481
I'll make you an incredible five course meal if it means I can stay at home

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:15.261
what did we fight for again as woman,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.600
because I'd much rather be exhausted from cooking and cleaning for my family

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:24.681
than be exhausted as career driven woman working a job I don't like

00:01:24.682 --> 00:01:25.921
You can hate me all you want,

00:01:25.922 --> 00:01:30.201
but I'd 100% rather stay home and be provided for by my man

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:32.181
and take care of him in return
