00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
I just think there's shitty people and then there's not shitty people.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.080
I really do not think it's all men.

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:11.481
I'm not on that team. I'm one of the more gender equal kind of,

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:12.881
kind of feminist women. Like,

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.601
I don't hate men. I have a boyfriend,

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:16.361
I live with a man. I have a son.

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:18.361
I think because I'm a mother and I have a son,

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:20.841
I'm not gonna paint men with this broad brush

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:22.321
and kind of throw them all away,

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:28.061
because I have a son, and I know he has a beautiful little heart,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.940
and I've watched it, so I helped grow it.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.440
I think the way that men have been raised in past generations to, like,

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:36.961
try to, like,

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:38.841
make them stay cavemen, like,

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.121
we weren't letting them become full humans

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:42.801
with feelings and thoughts and emotions,

00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:46.161
and there was this pressure on them to be this provider and blah, blah,

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:47.601
blah. And I think some men, like,

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:49.881
super lean into that because it's easier,

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:52.401
it's safer than having to talk about your feelings

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:54.141
and feel your feelings and shit.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.080
I have encountered many kind men in my life.

00:00:57.081 --> 00:01:00.181
I have had many friends that I respect.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.920
And I just think since most men,

00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:05.041
up until this point,

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:08.961
we're not raised to feel their feelings or think about other people,

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:10.961
empathy was just beyond them.

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:13.561
It seems like it's a lot of men.

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:16.541
And with the way violence towards women has handled

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.880
and how many men Like just whether they're one of the good ones,

00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:21.281
but they just sit there and stay quiet.

00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:26.041
I think things like that can make a lot of resentment towards men.

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:26.641
But. No,

00:01:26.642 --> 00:01:28.521
it's not all men, but. Yeah,

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:31.021
but I would never be like not all men, cause
