00:00.720 --> 00:03.400
This has been my favorite late night snack lately.

00:03.401 --> 00:07.041
Just hear me out. We do a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

00:07.042 --> 00:09.721
Sometimes I do two scoops or three.

00:09.722 --> 00:12.501
Then we take some good quality olive oil,

00:13.160 --> 00:17.220
put some on top. This is what I've been having the past few nights.

00:17.560 --> 00:21.360
I made this cherry compote that is so good.

00:21.361 --> 00:23.761
It's just cooked down cherries with some lemon juice

00:23.762 --> 00:25.441
and a little bit of maple syrup.

00:25.442 --> 00:29.481
I broke them up, and I'm left with this beautiful compote.

00:29.482 --> 00:34.301
Put some of that on top. I also make sure that it's a little warm.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.580
It's just good if it's warm with the vanilla ice cream.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.160
Then we take some good quality,

00:42.161 --> 00:44.721
flaky sea salt. It doesn't have to be a lot,

00:44.722 --> 00:48.241
just a pinch on top. Oh,

00:48.242 --> 00:49.841
my goodness. This looks so good.

00:49.842 --> 00:53.481
There's something about the olive oil and the vanilla ice cream

00:53.482 --> 00:55.161
and then the sweetness of the cherry,

00:55.162 --> 00:59.101
but the crunch of the salt. This is so good.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.617
Yes.
