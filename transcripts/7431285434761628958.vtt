00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.240
Trump is putting on a performance of masculinity

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:04.920
because he's not actually masculine

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:08.520
I mean this is a guy who spends more time with his makeup artist than with it

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.680
with his own advisers masculine men aren't um

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:14.320
manipulated by people who give them compliments

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:17.800
I mean at this point Donald Trump is putting side check men

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:20.360
masculine men actually protect women

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:23.640
they don't enact abortion bans that endanger women

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:29.040
and so even based on Donald Trump's own definition of masculinity

00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:32.800
and if you want hyper masculinity of being a protector of women

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:35.518
Donald Trump is failing at his own definition of it
