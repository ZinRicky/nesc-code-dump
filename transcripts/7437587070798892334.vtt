00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.480
In about 24 hours, I'm gonna have 9,

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:05.841
10 year olds sleeping over in my house for my daughter's birthday.

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:08.741
They're doing, like a spa slumber party situation.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.480
This is the state of my living room right now.

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:15.181
Anyone who tells you balloon garlands are easy is lying to you.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.880
Um, this is where we're at.

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:20.201
I've been working on the balloon Garland for at least

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.341
an hour and a half. It's not up yet.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.280
Stay tuned for all the decor she's doing Wednesday.

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:26.561
Adam themed, cause she's, like,

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:27.561
so freaking cool.

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:29.841
And I'm pretty much killing myself trying to make this, like,

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.561
the coolest birthday ever

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.621
cause it's 10. It's double digits.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.495
It's gotta be big. I might be more excited than she is.
