00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.360
I'm not an organized person,

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:04.201
so I have had kids stuff hiding in corners for years.

00:00:04.202 --> 00:00:06.401
And I finally did the big overhaul

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:08.681
and organized all of their papers and art.

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:10.001
Now I know what you're thinking, Lisa.

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:11.681
This looks like a manic cleaning frenzy.

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:14.561
And you would be right. Got the idea from this person on Pinterest.

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:15.881
And then I went to my favorite website,

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:16.761
Teachers Pay Teachers,

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:19.761
and got all of these print outs for the labels for my boxes.

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:22.161
With two kids who are now in third and fourth grade,

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:23.601
there has been a lot of backup.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.160
I did a really good job of organizing their stuff for a couple years,

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.121
but it's gotten out of hand since then.

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.401
The original post that I found

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:32.281
had all of the instructions on what to buy.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.761
I'm also gonna link that in my Amazon store,

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:37.441
cause once I got going, this actually went really quickly.

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.201
Then I got to decorate the fronts and make it fun for the kids,

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:41.960
and I really hope I can keep up with this.
