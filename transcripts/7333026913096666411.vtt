00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.360
If you've been thinking about buying

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.080
this little digital camera from the TikTok shop,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.120
the one linked right here,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.560
I promise you

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.720
it's worth it.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.280
Not only is it $14

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.120
and there's a $5 off coupon,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.820
it is legitimately a good camera.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.920
I get that the price makes it feel scammy.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.960
Like, no fucking way,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.400
no way am I getting a 1080 p

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.520
digital camera that takes pictures.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.400
44 megapixel pictures.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.840
Like this shit, you know,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.260
rivals camera phones,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.300
the good ones.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.520
The. The reason why the price maybe is where it's at

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.080
is cause the body is a little bit light.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.080
It's made of a lightweight plastic,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.700
so it feels very light,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.440
but that doesn't change what it's got on the inside.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.400
On top of the camera itself being amazing,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.640
it comes with everything you need.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.520
It comes with an SD card and the battery

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.480
and the cord to charge it and get it all going.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.200
This thing, it comes complete.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.360
When the box arrives,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.520
you can take it out,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.400
pop in the card,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.200
pop in the battery,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.180
and boom, boom, boom.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.880
Get going and start doing what you wanna do.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.360
Like just getting the SD card.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.760
I was just very confused.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.280
Like, the battery and SD card alone

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.560
is worth more than the price,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.880
but now I'm also getting a camera

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.840
that takes really good pictures.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.680
Like, I don't understand how it works.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.020
I get that it feels like what, but it's.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.320
In my opinion,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.440
it's not too Good to be true.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.560
So get it before it sells out again

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.522
cause it's constantly selling out.
