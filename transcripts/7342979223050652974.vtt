My husband grew up eating Pop Tarts

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
and Toaster Strudels,

00:03.000 --> 00:04.880
and this morning he was craving them,

00:04.880 --> 00:06.960
so I decided to make him a hybrid

00:06.960 --> 00:09.820
out of both a Pop Tart and a Toaster Strudel.

00:10.120 --> 00:13.160
Started by adding my dry ingredients into a food

00:13.160 --> 00:16.420
processor and slowly dropping in some cold butter.

00:16.520 --> 00:19.800
I let that go until it resembled the size of pebbles.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.040
For my dry ingredients,

00:21.040 --> 00:22.900
I whisked up an egg,

00:23.080 --> 00:24.520
added a splash of milk,

00:24.520 --> 00:26.160
made sure that was all combined

00:26.160 --> 00:29.500
before I added that to my dry mixture.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.200
It was a lot easier plopping it on a work surface

00:32.200 --> 00:33.640
and kneading it for a little bit,

00:33.640 --> 00:34.680
so that's what I did

00:34.680 --> 00:36.560
before I wrapped it up in cling film

00:36.560 --> 00:37.520
and put it in the fridge

00:37.520 --> 00:39.820
while I got started on my filling.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.280
I was debating between raspberries and strawberries,

00:42.280 --> 00:43.680
but strawberries won,

00:43.680 --> 00:46.840
so I added them to a pot with some honey and lemon.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.920
When they were cooked down,

00:47.920 --> 00:48.880
I blended them up,

00:48.880 --> 00:50.120
added some cornstarch,

00:50.120 --> 00:51.520
and let that thicken

00:51.520 --> 00:53.820
before putting that in the fridge to cool.

00:54.000 --> 00:54.920
In the meantime,

00:54.920 --> 00:58.760
I rolled out my dough and cut it into six pieces.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.480
I wanted them a little bit smaller than usual,

01:01.480 --> 01:02.440
so I did that

01:02.440 --> 01:05.360
before spreading some of the strawberry filling on top.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.680
Then I placed a second piece of dough on top of that

01:08.680 --> 01:12.000
before using a fork to seal the edges

01:12.000 --> 01:14.180
and poke some holes in the top.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.280
I let them bake for about 30 minutes,

01:16.280 --> 01:18.080
and then pulled them out and let them cool

01:18.080 --> 01:20.020
while I started on my glaze.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.200
He loves lemon,

01:21.200 --> 01:24.340
so I decided to go with a lemon glaze for these.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.040
I didn't want it really thick,

01:26.040 --> 01:29.060
so I decided to make it a little bit thinner,

01:29.080 --> 01:30.280
and they were done.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.920
Lucky walked in at the perfect time to try these,

01:32.920 --> 01:34.600
and he absolutely loved them.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.800
I'd never had a Pop Tart or Toaster Strudel before,

01:37.800 --> 01:39.780
but these were really good.
