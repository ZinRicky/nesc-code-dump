00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.960
Some of y'all can't think for yourself and it shows.

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:03.681
The Ballerina Farms article that came out,

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:05.401
the internet is just running with it.

00:00:05.402 --> 00:00:05.921
Riddle me this.

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.521
How do we go from hating somebody because they're cosplaying,

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:11.481
being poor cause they're doing home making and home sitting activities,

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:14.441
to then hating her because she must have nanny,

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:15.781
she's unrealistic,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.000
to now feeling pity for her for an article that came out

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.521
that most likely isn't accurate and has a lot of bias?

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:22.761
And why this article? Well,

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:25.241
because culture hates women

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:28.521
who feel fulfilled by being a wife and a mother.

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:30.561
Anytime you go against what is countercultural

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:33.001
to the main narrative of what a woman should be

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.721
according to feminism, you're an enemy.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:37.421
A woman should pursue her career no matter who it hurts,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.560
no matter what it takes. She should be selfish.

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:40.921
She should think of herself first.

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:42.281
Emma is incredibly successful.

00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:43.321
She is a businesswoman.

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:45.841
She has managed her household on top of being a businesswoman.

00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:48.041
She has eight children. Successful.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:52.361
That's successful. And because she didn't pursue Juilliard,

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:53.801
that now she's oppressed.

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:56.321
Women can change their minds and what they want in life.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.561
I know because I did it.

00:00:57.562 --> 00:01:01.241
I used to want a very lucrative medical based career.

00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:03.681
I wanted to be working non stop.

00:01:03.682 --> 00:01:04.961
And then I met my husband.

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:06.441
And after I met my husband,

00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:08.201
my priorities in life changed,

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:11.521
my goals changed in life. Something that I didn't see changing,

00:01:11.522 --> 00:01:12.681
but that's What happens in life?

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:14.481
Things change. That doesn't mean you're oppressed.

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:16.841
That doesn't mean you're being held back by your spouse.

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:19.081
Only people who know how Hannah and Daniel's marriage works

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:19.921
is Hannah and Daniel.

00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:22.561
And to insert yourself into something and think you know everything

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:26.321
based on one sleazy journalist article is embarrassing to yourself.

00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:29.472
So get a hobby, mind your own business, and move on.
