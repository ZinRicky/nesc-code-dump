00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.240
For all the women in those 20,

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:03.961
30, all.

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:05.641
It could never happen to me.

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:08.601
Not my husband. He's such a good husband.

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:12.361
He's such a good father. He's so successful.

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:12.881
Oh, my.

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:15.221
It could never happen. Not my husband.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.980
Not my husband. Never.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.080
No. This is where that thinking will fucking get you.

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:23.481
So it does not fucking matter.

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.321
You know in your gut

00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:28.001
who your fucking husband is and what kind of man he is.

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.681
You know it. And if you don't know it,

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:32.321
you'll eventually find out.

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:34.201
And I'm sure it doesn't come as a shock.

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:35.121
In his book,

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:38.561
he's very clear that he's been a womanizer most of his life.

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:40.481
He's loved sleeping with minute women

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:44.641
and having his fucking fill of the rock star life.

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:48.901
So you can only lie to yourself for so long,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.560
and then you get to a point

00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:53.121
where you either have to wake the fuck up and see

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:55.481
and acknowledge what has always been there,

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:57.481
what you've been trying to pretend is not there,

00:00:57.482 --> 00:01:01.341
or you just dig deeper and continue to lie to yourself further.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.200
It's your life, it's your choice.

00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:05.841
You do what you want. I'm just saying,

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:07.601
if in your gut, in your heart,

00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:09.581
there's something in there that's like,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.440
you know, this marriage or something,

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:12.481
this man, the something.

00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:13.801
I would listen to that feeling

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:16.821
so you don't get stuck in these fucking positions.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.520
Being one of the women on this side

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:22.261
trying to shout to The ladies in the back
