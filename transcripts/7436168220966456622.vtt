00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
Value the life that is growing inside of their womb without shame.

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:08.641
Of illegal right is a protected entitlement to do something.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.001
So by removing women's right to choose,

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.001
you are not conferring a new right upon women

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:15.921
that they didn't previously have.

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:18.281
You are increasing the maternal mortality rate.

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:20.201
You're increasing the infant mortality rate.

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:21.441
You're making it less likely

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:23.481
that women will be able to make aspirations

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:24.361
and achieve them.

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:27.601
You're making it less likely that women can get out of poverty.

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:30.721
You're making it more likely that women are dependent upon a man.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:33.861
Making it less likely that women can escape abusive relationships.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.080
You're forcing children to give childbirth children.

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:41.361
I just wanna make sure we're crystal clear on this point.

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:43.741
You are unaliving women.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.400
The maternal mortality rate in Texas alone

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:51.941
has gone up 56% since its abortion ban.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.280
Forcing people and children to do this against their will

00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:58.581
is nothing short of torture.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.680
This country would never enforce a law or policy

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:06.501
that increased the male mortality rate by 56%.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.200
And even if we did, we certainly wouldn't try to disguise it

00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:15.053
and dress it up as some kind of right for them.
