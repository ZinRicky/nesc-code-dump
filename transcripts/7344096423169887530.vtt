00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.120
Chicken nuggets

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.600
are a food I have never fed my kids before,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.080
and that's because I prioritize their health over

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.960
convenience.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.920
Nuggets may appear kid friendly and fun for the littles,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.880
but nothing could be further from the truth.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.400
What scares me the most is the quality of the chicken,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.880
which comes from confined animal factory farms.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.440
There fed a corn in soy diet and slaughtered as a young,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.320
likely sick bird,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.540
then processed with bleach to remove bacteria.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.840
Other ingredients that scare me are MSG,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.200
a salty flavor enhancer,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.880
and the vegetable oils like canola,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.480
corn, and soybean that they're fried in.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.240
It's really pretty simple to make nuggets.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.520
You just dunk the nugget pieces into batter of flour,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.240
baking powder,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.880
baking soda,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.560
salt and pepper,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.360
and sparkling water,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.560
which give them an airy crunch.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.240
Then frying quality oil like schmaltz

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.680
for about five minutes per side.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.040
My homemade nuggets are high in protein and satisfying.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.280
Dunk them in a good ingredient,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.930
ketchup or homemade barbecue sauce.
