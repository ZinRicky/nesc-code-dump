00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.840
If you're lucky enough to date a girl who does Pilates or yoga,

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.221
you should marry her.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.400
these girls are part of the elite,

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:08.821
high value women

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.560
instead of partying all night or on weekends

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.021
you know what she's doing?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.840
she's doing her skincare and then hopping into bed early

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:19.621
because she knows that she has to wake up early just to get to her class

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.560
pilates and yoga might sound like cute

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:23.921
girly workouts

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:25.901
but they're definitely not for the weak

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.320
Theyâ€™re doing hour long full body workouts, doing pulse squats for long durations,

00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:32.821
core workouts,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.380
doing planks to downward dogs,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.640
crazy movements

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:39.061
and half the time they're not even breaking a sweat

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.760
but you may not think that these workout classes are hard,

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:45.881
but I've seen some of the strongest looking men not be able to keep up in class.

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:50.301
these women are flexible and usually in the best shape of their lives

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.920
Not only that, but they finish these workouts and are in a great mood

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:56.801
after getting all these natural endorphins

00:00:56.802 --> 00:01:00.281
and then they're ready to tackle on the day like it's nothing

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:03.921
like they didn't just sweat for an hour and do an intense workout

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:07.721
These workouts are helping them relax and lower their stress hormones

00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:12.221
Improves their energy and overall physical and mental wellness

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.420
They don't have the energy to go out and party

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.060
because they're putting in the energy to better themselves

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.040
and they're more likely to treat you better

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:21.761
because they're in a good mood after getting a workout in

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:23.401
so she's in great shape

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:24.721
she's less stressed out

00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:26.041
she's generally happier

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:27.801
and she'll probably treat you better

00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:29.421
why would you not marry her?
