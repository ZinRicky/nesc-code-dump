00:00.080 --> 00:02.840
Women actually don't need to do everything that men do.

00:02.840 --> 00:04.600
We don't need a seat at every table.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.480
We don't need to be involved in every industry.

00:06.480 --> 00:07.400
We don't need to be upset

00:07.400 --> 00:09.160
when an industry is dominated by males.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.240
We just don't.

00:10.240 --> 00:10.960
Let me explain.

00:10.960 --> 00:13.040
Today I had to get two new tires put on my car,

00:13.040 --> 00:15.520
and every single person at the tire store was a male.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.140
And tire stores are boring.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.520
So boring. It was freezing cold outside.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.680
The tools are all greasy.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.420
It seems so complicated.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.080
And if we're being totally honest,

00:25.080 --> 00:26.740
women generally don't wanna do that.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.640
I also had a pest control company come

00:28.640 --> 00:29.760
and spray the outside of the house

00:29.760 --> 00:32.000
just to make sure that there's no scorpions around here,

00:32.000 --> 00:33.120
because we have scorpions here.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.000
And the stories that I was hearing

00:35.000 --> 00:37.320
from the pest control technicians blew my mind.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.840
They were telling me about rats

00:38.840 --> 00:41.120
and about cockroaches and snakes and things

00:41.120 --> 00:41.960
that. I'm like,

00:41.960 --> 00:42.920
that sounds horrible.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.440
Again, another industry I don't wanna be part of.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.720
I also saw some construction workers out again

00:47.720 --> 00:48.800
in the freezing cold

00:48.800 --> 00:49.680
doing their thing.

00:49.680 --> 00:50.480
Looked awful.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.120
The point is,

00:51.120 --> 00:53.920
there are a lot of things in this world that women

00:53.920 --> 00:55.600
generally don't wanna do.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.240
It's true of a lot of blue collar jobs,

00:57.240 --> 00:58.440
a lot of white collar jobs,

00:58.440 --> 01:00.680
a lot of hobbies and activities and interest.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.760
Society sends girls and women this message

01:02.760 --> 01:03.800
that we need to be out there

01:03.800 --> 01:05.160
competing against men.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.000
And also this message

01:06.000 --> 01:08.680
that we need to be represented in every industry.

01:08.680 --> 01:11.860
And nobody really ever stops and asks why.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.720
We have plenty of men around.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.040
Let's let them do those things.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.440
They enjoy doing those things.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.320
They wanna do those things.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.640
They are good at those things.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.080
Men and women are very different.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.440
We are good at different things.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.880
We enjoy doing different things.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.480
And that is not only just a fact of life,

01:25.480 --> 01:26.720
that is a good thing.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.400
Those differences are what makes the world go around.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.000
Women don't want to do everything that men can do,

01:32.000 --> 01:33.300
and that's okay.
