00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.968
I'm waiting on our 

00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:02.090
pasture raised cowshare 

00:00:02.091 --> 00:00:03.120
to be ready for pickup

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:04.382
so I restocked on some 

00:00:04.383 --> 00:00:05.205
grass fed beef 

00:00:05.206 --> 00:00:07.400
and a pasture raised chicken for bone broth

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:09.754
got some sprouts for easy micronutrients 

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:11.880
cucumbers and onions for pickling

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.260
I love this raw cheese 

00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:14.880
and pasture cottage cheese 

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:15.840
for easy protein

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:16.999
and then raw kefir 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.390
for beneficial microbes 

00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:19.260
and holy butter

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.980
both coconut water and dates 

00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:22.600
are good sources of potassium

00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:23.600
and then mushrooms have 

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:24.560
so many health benefits

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:25.360
fruits an obvious one

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:26.631
because it's an easy carb 

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:28.197
& packed full of micronutrients 

00:00:28.198 --> 00:00:28.980
and antioxidants

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.600
avocados for saturated fat

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:31.798
limes for electrolytes 

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:32.997
and then these two are 

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:34.040
always in our fridge

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:35.623
and though these ones are not

00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:36.880
 from this grocery haul

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:38.242
these are sprouts favorites 

00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:40.140
that are literally always in my kitchen
