00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.760
What is one thing that you do that absolutely pisses feminist off?

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:05.881
I'll go first.

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:10.201
I take my physical fitness and my appearance very seriously,

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:12.981
not only for myself, but also for my husband.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.640
I am his and I want him to be proud of me when he sees me in public

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:17.921
or just when we're alone.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:22.121
Our life and our modern day culture is full of temptation.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.041
Sorry, there's a freaking fly on me.

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:26.481
And my man is a good man, but he's still a man.

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:28.801
So if he's gonna be being a dirty old little man,

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:30.981
I want him to be dirty with me.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.760
And I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that.

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.481
But if I tell women that I lost

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:37.361
like 50 pounds in two months after my last baby,

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:39.761
and I did it in an epic biohacking,

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:41.961
safe way that even doubled my milk supply,

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:44.281
I mean, it just gets their goat

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:47.021
to know that I care about my physical appearance.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.360
For my man, yes,

00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:50.521
of course. A lot of it was for me.

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:52.081
My self confidence, my health.

00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:54.921
I don't wanna be someone that he has to take care of when we get old,

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:57.561
just like he should wanna take care of himself for me.

00:00:57.562 --> 00:00:58.921
Second thing, people are like,

00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:01.721
that's so creepy. He doesn't like me to cut my hair.

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:03.001
And I've always been a super,

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:03.801
like, traditional,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.960
so that doesn't bother me at all.

00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.121
But like, I worked so hard this year,

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:10.881
To get my hair like this. Oh, wait,

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:11.901
there it is.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.340
Oh, yeah.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.720
He likes long hair on me, and that's okay,

00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:18.321
but, man,

00:01:18.322 --> 00:01:20.041
it pisses women off when I say that.

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:21.121
Like, I don't cut my hair,

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.241
and I grow it out for him.

00:01:22.242 --> 00:01:24.801
Also do all this biohacking stuff and anti aging.

00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:27.441
I wear patches every single night for wrinkles.

00:01:27.442 --> 00:01:29.281
I wear a stem cell patch that, like,

00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:31.401
is clinically proven to reverse your age.

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:34.161
And to be clear, it's not that I have a fear of aging,

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:35.561
but statistically, like,

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.881
we age way quicker than we're supposed to,

00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:40.121
or that we even did decades ago.

00:01:40.122 --> 00:01:42.401
And that's because we live in a toxic environment full of crap,

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.321
and we're wearing a toxic suit every single day,

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:46.001
toxic makeup, toxic everything.

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:47.861
So it's also for my health,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.400
trying to combat chronic illness, autoimmune.

00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:53.161
I have an entire Instagram page on that,

00:01:53.162 --> 00:01:53.681
because that's, like,

00:01:53.682 --> 00:01:54.841
a totally different initiative,

00:01:54.842 --> 00:01:56.921
what I do here. But, yeah,

00:01:56.922 --> 00:02:01.641
I take my beauty and my appearance and my health very seriously.

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:03.721
Not just for me, but for him.

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:05.121
I mean, he's my partner.

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:06.881
You don't wanna be hitched up to someone

00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:09.181
that's gonna drag you down for the rest of your life.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.719
He's already seven years older than me,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.601
and you already know that.

00:02:11.602 --> 00:02:13.521
I love age gaps between men and women,

00:02:13.522 --> 00:02:15.081
specifically men being older.

00:02:15.082 --> 00:02:15.761
But, yeah,

00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:18.481
it makes me feel pretty freaking good when he's proud and he's like,

00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:20.001
damn, that's My wife.

00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:23.061
So I go to the gym, I take care of my body,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.720
take care of my wrinkles, I take care of my face,

00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:27.401
I grow my hair out for him.

00:02:27.402 --> 00:02:29.781
There's so much temptation in this world,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.160
and if he's gonna be looking at other things like most men do,

00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:34.701
I just want him to be like, nah,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.620
my biatch is hotter.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.600
But watch how many angry comments I'm gonna get to this,

00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:43.201
because it lights a fire under women's butts

00:02:43.202 --> 00:02:48.241
when I say I like to look good for my man

00:02:48.242 --> 00:02:49.694
because I think it's important.
