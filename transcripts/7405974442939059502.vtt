00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
These are things that make men instantly more hot.

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:04.561
Starting off with No.

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:07.961
1 when they're unaware of how attractive they are.

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:10.921
When men are oblivious to how attractive they are,

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:13.341
it's just an instant panty dropper.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.640
Men who are aware of this are kind of the worst.

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.801
Number two when a man has five o'clock shadow.

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.721
Okay, this is a personal preference,

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.041
but it gets me every time.

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:24.761
Number three when he has a low voice.

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.241
Not like a very white voice,

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:28.281
but a nice low voice.

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:31.621
Makes someone's less attractive qualities way more attractive.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.640
Developed a crush on voices alone.

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:36.721
No. 4 the ability to have banter.

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:40.681
There's nothing worse than having witty banter with a brick wall

00:00:40.682 --> 00:00:42.781
that actually makes guys less attractive.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.360
Smelling like a man.

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:48.861
And not necessarily anything that sold out of a bottle,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.684
just light pheromones. That scent is so damn appealing to any woman.
