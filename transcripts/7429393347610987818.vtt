00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
I was pretty hesitant to get into rabbits

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:03.901
when I first started home studying.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.780
Chickens just seem like the answer for your meat needs.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.600
While chickens are easy to raise

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.641
and small animals

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:13.781
that you can pretty much just raise anywhere in your backyard,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.560
they do take up a considerable amount of room

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:18.141
if you're free ranging them.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.460
They can be loud

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.080
and when raising a prolific breed that creates a lot of meat fast.

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:25.341
Unique Cornish cross,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.620
which means you need to rely on a hatchery to hatch your eggs for you.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.040
While you could get into some heritage breeds

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:34.941
and they take a long time to grow out,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.960
rabbits are kind of the answer.

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.701
They're fast growing, they multiply,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.080
and you can do this on a small scale.

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:43.701
You don't need a lot of space.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.400
And they taste delicious. They're very mild.

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:47.981
Me they don't taste gamey.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.240
Maybe wild rabbit taste gamey,

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:53.861
but the rabbit raised domestically taste just like chicken.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.360
The flavour is a bit more complex than chicken,

00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:58.821
but it's just as tender if cooked correctly.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.060
Today I'm gonna cook a traditional rabbit stew.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.000
All the ingredients, this was what I had on hand.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.441
You can definitely add more spices and different vegetables

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:11.181
like celery, but I just had carrots and onions.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.220
I added Coors butter and some broth I made for my backyard chickens.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.600
This is came out so beautiful.

00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:21.141
The house smelled amazing while I was cooking this.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.460
The meat was so tender it Just slid right off the bone.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.900
And it paired amazingly with some sourdough and Coors butter.
