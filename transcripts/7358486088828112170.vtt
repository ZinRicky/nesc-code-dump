00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.780
This is irresponsible.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.500
The public school teachers don't even want the Bill.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.080
They're not even asking you for this.

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:11.881
We just passed legislation and have FROs in every school.

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:13.621
Can we see if that works yet?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.840
I'm upset. Not out of because I don't like you all individually,

00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:22.001
because I'm mad cause this Bill puts my child at risk.

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.241
And all the mothers out here that just got put out,

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:26.121
they're saying their children at risk.

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:27.821
Look at that gallery.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.740
They're asking you not to do this.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.320
Put partisan politics aside.

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:34.961
I ask you this all the time,

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:37.001
but this Bill is dangerous.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:40.241
Don't do it. Teachers don't want it,

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:41.881
the school districts don't want it.

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:43.281
Nobody doesn't want it.

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:44.481
It's not gonna work.

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:47.021
It's going to cause more school shootings.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.400
What happened today is a gallery full of mothers who are concerned

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:55.301
and we put them out because you trying to put guns in teachers hands.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.880
We ought to be ashamed.

00:00:58.881 --> 00:00:59.588
Mrs. Speaker.
