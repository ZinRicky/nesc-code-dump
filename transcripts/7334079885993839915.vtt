00:00.240 --> 00:02.240
Let's make some lasagna from scratch.

00:02.240 --> 00:03.680
It was a gloomy day outside,

00:03.680 --> 00:05.600
so what better way to spend it

00:05.600 --> 00:07.500
than cooking a comforting meal?

00:07.560 --> 00:10.120
I started off by making my mozzarella cheese.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.200
I added some milk,

00:11.200 --> 00:11.960
citric acid

00:11.960 --> 00:13.040
and run it to my pot,

00:13.040 --> 00:14.180
let that sit,

00:14.320 --> 00:16.040
and then sliced it all up,

00:16.040 --> 00:18.720
transferred my curds to a cheese cloth

00:18.720 --> 00:20.600
to let all the way drain out.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.840
That sit for about five to 10 minutes,

00:22.840 --> 00:25.180
and then when all the way was drained out,

00:25.480 --> 00:28.320
I added it back to the pot with my heated up whey

00:28.320 --> 00:29.720
and stretched it.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.120
Once it was shiny and smooth,

00:31.120 --> 00:32.600
I formed it into a ball

00:32.600 --> 00:34.880
and placed that in some cold water.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.560
Then I made a really simple pasta dough with some eggs,

00:37.560 --> 00:39.900
flour, olive oil, and salt,

00:40.160 --> 00:42.480
kneaded that until it was all smooth,

00:42.480 --> 00:44.960
and then wrapped it in some plastic wrap.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.840
Tub rest for about 30 minutes to an hour.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.800
My favorite part of cooking any meal is chopping.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.880
So we started chopping up some carrots really finely,

00:54.880 --> 00:55.840
some celery,

00:55.840 --> 00:56.840
and some onion.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.640
You can use purple onion or white onion.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.700
I just love a good purple onion.

01:01.280 --> 01:04.520
And then I brown my meat in my Dutch oven,

01:04.520 --> 01:05.480
add my vegetables,

01:05.480 --> 01:06.720
some tomato paste,

01:06.720 --> 01:08.560
some crushed tomatoes,

01:08.560 --> 01:09.760
and some herbs.

01:09.760 --> 01:14.040
I let that simmer for about 30 minutes to 45

01:14.040 --> 01:16.700
while I prep my lasagna sheets.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.760
I cut my dough into eight pieces

01:18.760 --> 01:21.420
and then rolled them out into rectangles.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.360
When it Was about time to assemble.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.680
I made a quick bechamel

01:24.680 --> 01:26.720
sauce to go in between my layers,

01:26.720 --> 01:28.520
and then started putting it all together.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.620
I put down a layer of the ragu,

01:30.960 --> 01:31.800
some bechamel,

01:31.800 --> 01:33.560
then my lasagna sheets,

01:33.560 --> 01:36.820
and then kept repeating that until I reached the top.

01:36.880 --> 01:37.520
At this point,

01:37.520 --> 01:38.800
I took my mozzarella,

01:38.800 --> 01:39.720
sliced it up,

01:39.720 --> 01:41.340
and layered it on top.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.600
I decided to only do one layer,

01:43.600 --> 01:46.520
but feel free to add any other cheese that you want.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.000
And then I popped in the oven for 35 minutes

01:49.000 --> 01:50.340
and pulled it out,

01:50.400 --> 01:52.680
and it came out so perfect.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.680
But since I couldn't wait,

01:53.680 --> 01:55.860
I burnt my tongue with that first bite.
