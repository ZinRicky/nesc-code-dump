00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Sophia, I'm saying this with love.

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:04.721
I'm not coming at you. I'm.

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:06.761
I'm trying to come alongside you

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:09.781
because I looked at your profile and now you're 23.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.160
I'm not trying to be rude or disrespectful to you in the fucking least.

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:17.281
Like, I need you to understand that part.

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:19.161
There is nothing but love.

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.681
Like if you were my daughter.

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:22.381
Because at 23,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.720
I didn't know this at the time,

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:26.881
and I suspect that maybe you don't know this either.

00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:27.961
Your brain, mama,

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:29.321
is not fully developed.

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:36.141
You're not even the complete and total person that you're gonna be

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.480
to present to this world. See what I'm saying?

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:44.261
Your brain is still fully forming.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.440
And I'm only saying it like that for you to understand the gravity,

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:48.601
not because you're stupid,

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:52.201
not because I'm talking down to you like the shit.

00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:54.501
Like, weighs on me to be like, wow,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.620
we make such life long decisions

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.280
without literally without all the tools to make them.

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:05.921
So I understand that at 23,

00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:11.121
you believe in your chest that if you just love yourself,

00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:13.941
you're gonna find a man that loves you on that same level.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.440
And at that point, now,

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:16.721
you can be completely vulnerable

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:20.821
and give him full authority over your life

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.560
by purposely rejecting all opportunities to have any.

00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:29.221
Any choice for yourself.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.680
But I need you to understand,

00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:34.421
at 41, almost 42,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.520
you gotta understand the perspective that I can see this from.

00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:41.801
Because I was 23, I Held those beliefs,

00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:43.341
I made those decisions,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.140
and I'm living proof that it backfires.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.900
And I'm not the only one

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.400
I'm happy for.

00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:57.161
I don't give a fuck that dudes online are gonna make a joke about me.

00:01:57.162 --> 00:01:59.301
What I care about is women like you.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.700
That learn before it's too late.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.520
That it's a life of service to another person.

00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:08.421
Is not a life of fulfillment.
