00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.000
I think this is my favorite comment.

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.401
Why would a woman sacrifice her heart,

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:05.601
her energy, her time,

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:06.581
her effort,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.020
her years to find a mate on somebody who is willingly broken?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.020
Why does she have to sacrifice herself?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.840
Why do we always have to play this martyr

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:22.341
in order to be considered worthy?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.660
Why do we need to pay the price for their deficiencies

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.480
and then be called not a good woman

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:32.521
because you didn't stay to take the abuse.

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:33.641
And abuse is a strong word,

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:36.941
so let's call it take. The lack of care,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.860
the lack of emotional investment.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.180
As a very happily married woman to a very confident,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.120
well loving man, I have to tell you,

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:48.781
a man who truly cherishes your heart will not treat it so carelessly.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.140
And a man who is capable of a long term commitment

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.660
isn't going to have to be taught.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.780
The labor and emotional sacrifice in that is beyond.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.500
Do not commit to a woman

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.140
until you are capable of what is required of a long term commitment.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.660
That's it. Most women just want a partner, not a project.
