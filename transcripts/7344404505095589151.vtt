00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.840
President Biden's border policy.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.000
Katie Britt is Margie Taylor Green

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.920
with a blowout and a gel manicure.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.800
They're the same person.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.840
They fight for the same things.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.040
It's just that Katie Britt

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.520
does it with a trad wife aesthetic,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.340
which is this misguided nostalgia for,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.560
you know, a past where white women had fewer rights

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.240
and women of color had no rights.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.560
It's a movement that's built on traditional masculinity,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.800
that women have to be subservient to their husband.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.360
But it's like,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.160
kind of empowerment

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.640
because women are choosing to,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.060
uh, be subservient.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.320
But the Tradwife, you know,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.720
aesthetic is not in movement,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.640
is not just rooted in sexism,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.920
it's also rooted in white supremacy.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.360
For example,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.520
a Tradwife started the White Baby Challenge.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.160
So the Tradwife is like white nationalism with lipstick.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.700
And it's not surprising to see the Republican Party

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.960
really go after white women

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.600
by literally

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.840
putting their biggest female rising star in a kitchen.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.600
Like, the Republican Party has spent decades

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.000
trying to court white female voters,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.040
using white nationalism to get them to vote

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.420
against their own interest

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.320
for Republican policies and candidates.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.680
And the Republican Party has been

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.960
really successful at this.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.840
If you look at the last 18 presidential elections,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.300
white women went for the Republican.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.920
Even though people are saying that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.440
the state of the union rebuttal,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.560
um, didn't go as planned,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.200
it went exactly as planned.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.860
Just based on their policies.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.926
This is the future that Republicans want.
