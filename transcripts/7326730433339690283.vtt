00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.740
on a video where I was talking about getting food stamps

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.540
someone decided to leave me this comment

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.180
if this doesn't scream I'm insecure

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.620
like what does

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.960
you have gotten to a point I would need this person

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:17.081
and everybody else to realise

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:19.541
like when you leave comments in somebody's video

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.240
I know that I'm a regular ass person in my house

00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:24.421
just videos go viral cause they go viral

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.620
and I know that you're a regular ass person in your house

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.280
so you took the time in your night to sit there and this is

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.381
I mean you probably took up the whole

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.340
like limit of text

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.440
you felt the

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:38.001
and this is actually the part two of our comment

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:39.421
so this is going back and forth

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.880
if this is what you have to do to make yourself feel better

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:49.741
I seriously question the quality of your life and the happiness in your heart

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.680
because if you have a house

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.801
two cars a beautiful family

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:55.281
a good paying job

00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:57.281
an amazing vinyl clinics collection

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:59.401
why are you on TikTok trolling me

00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:02.601
why are you on TikTok challenging a woman at the food stands office

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:03.661
how you doing

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.100
how are you doing

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.880
you know what I mean

00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:08.561
would you see me sitting there and just

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:09.401
you know bump it

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.041
no because that's ugly

00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:12.001
you wouldn't do it in real life

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:13.341
but you do it on TikTok

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.280
because you're probably not as happy as you like to think

00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:17.581
you know claim you are

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.700
so I hope you're doing okay

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.680
I hope you can like

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:25.461
see where you're at in life

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.200
realize maybe some things need to fucking change

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:29.441
and maybe make those changes

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:30.861
cause this is like
