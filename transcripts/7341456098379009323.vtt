00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.800
After arriving home from a quick

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.080
ski trip to Aspen with the kids,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.720
I decided to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.880
put together a batch of fermented muffin butter

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.640
so I could send them off to school the next morning

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.480
with a healthy,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.880
nutrient dense breakfast.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.240
My goal was to roll out of bed

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.880
and basically throw the muffins in the oven,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.880
so I did the bulk of the leg work the night before.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.120
My top priority is always feeding my children

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.520
foods that will make them thrive.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.520
And that's why the only wheat I bake with is ironcorn.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.040
It's the most ancient form of wheat

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.460
and has never been hybridized,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.520
which means that it's a pure and original grain.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.760
In fact, we thrived on it for thousands of years.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.280
It's much higher in antioxidants,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.780
protein, and keratinoids,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.520
especially when compared to modern wheat.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.760
And the coolest part is

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.920
it doesn't upset your stomach.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.520
These muffins are so wholesome,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.240
low and unrefined

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.080
coconut sugar.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.520
I only used five tablespoons for the entire batch.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.400
And they even use up sourdough discard

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.420
that you probably have in the back of the fridge.
