00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
I'm a mom to a three year old girl

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:06.361
and I believe that by the time she's an adult,

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:08.121
we will have a free Palestine.

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:10.661
We're standing outside post DNC.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.740
Pamela is just on payday. How do you feel right now?

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.600
I wish that I could celebrate right now.

00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:17.021
Mama's supposed to feel joy.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.360
Ask about a speaker on that stage.

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.641
The fact that they weren't allowed even five minutes.

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:28.341
This could have been a gesture of goodwill.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.440
They could have done that

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:32.041
and they didn't do that. We are the party of the rights.

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:33.861
We are the only party that will guarantee.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.320
We are the only party that is talking about banning assault weapons.

00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:38.761
I'm a lifelong Democrat

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:41.721
and work elect Democrats up and down the ballot.

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:43.801
I want my hair to be the best candidate possible.

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:46.001
We had so many politicians.

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.301
Horsewoman Corey Bush, Summer Lee,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.880
Representative Ilhan Omar.

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:51.921
Their movement is just gonna grow and grow,

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:55.741
and in the last 24 hours, it's grown a lot. So I am very hopeful.
