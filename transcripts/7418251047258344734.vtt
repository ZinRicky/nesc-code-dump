Do you want the secret to the most delicious scalloped potatoes?

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:06.821
You have to make sure that you're slicing the potatoes evenly

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.200
and consistently, and that's really hard to do by hand,

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:10.641
so I prefer a little gadget.

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:12.281
I got this one from the TikTok shop.

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:14.101
It suctions to your work surface.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.640
It has, like,

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:17.761
three different blades, but it's gonna make sure that the potatoes

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:19.681
are the exact same thickness,

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:23.521
every single one of them. It also keeps your hands safe,

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:26.381
like you never get close to the blade at all,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.020
and everything is perfectly even and uniform.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.480
You take all those potatoes,

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:33.801
takes minutes to slice them,

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:36.641
boil them in a pot with heavy cream and chicken broth

00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:39.561
and all these spices listed on the screen.

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:42.961
Bake it with some cheese all in between and on top,

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:45.901
and top with whatever fresh herbs you like. Enjoy.
