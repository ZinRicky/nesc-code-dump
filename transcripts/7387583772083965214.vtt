00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.100
My mother in law invited us over for a July 4th pool party.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.540
So I decided to make something festive.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.840
A flag cake.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.481
People always ask me how we eat when we're in social settings.

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:14.861
And the truth is, my family eats the way we do.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.760
We are always sharing our health earnings

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.321
and collaborate in the kitchen.

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:20.361
There's a health epidemic in our nation

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:21.841
because of the foods we consume.

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:24.641
And that's why I choose to make my foods from scratch.

00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:26.561
Because then I can choose the ingredients we eat

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:28.521
rather than be unaware. Take Ein Korn,

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:31.121
for example. This flower is a health food.

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:33.561
The most primitive form of wheat known to man.

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:36.561
It doesn't upset stomachs because it's in its original form.

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:37.481
Some won't like that

00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:40.201
it isn't the same as white flour from Modern Wheat,

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:41.601
but some will praise that.

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:45.281
Every cake I've ever seen is loaded with white sugar and white flour.

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:47.201
So while homemade is better,

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:50.481
it's still not ideal if it's high in sugar and refined carbs.

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:52.641
They've let us to believe that we can't do it.

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:55.081
We can't make it. It must be store bought.

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:56.981
I implore you to throw out that narrative.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.360
You can make it, you should make it.

00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:02.121
Food impacts our health. It impacts every part of our lives.

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:03.481
All this to say

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:07.021
that's why I made this cake and why I share it with my family.
