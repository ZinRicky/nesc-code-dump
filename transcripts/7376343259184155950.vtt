00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.520
so I'm back to tell you why out of all the chicken crab I've ever bought

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:06.040
this has been the most useful and worth all of my money

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:08.680
she's not full right now cause I just got done with some baking oh

00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:09.720
questions on my previous video

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.800
so I thought I'd address some of them

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:11.880
yes this is on the countertop

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.320
this does not go in the refrigerator

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.500
this is on top of my stove right now or on the countertop

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.400
and it keeps the eggs at room temperature which is perfect for baking with

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:20.640
these eggs are farm fresh eggs

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:21.760
so they have not been processed

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:23.600
so they can sit on the counter for up to two weeks

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:25.060
does the eggs slide down

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.300
and as I take eggs off

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.800
you can see the eggs slide down and they rotate around

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:31.960
yes I had duck eggs on

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:33.240
even this little egg got stuck

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:36.720
so yes sometimes the eggs do be kinda stuck

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:40.200
and you just kinda like nudge them on their way down and tell them all

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.680
it's such a simple divide

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:45.320
and I'm telling you this is the best chicken crap you will ever buy

00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:48.240
there is so much useless chickens products on the market

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:50.020
here is now before it's sold out again

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.926
