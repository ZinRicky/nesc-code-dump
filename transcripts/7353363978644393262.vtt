00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.620
the having kids part is not something that holds me back dating

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.820
it's just it's like

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.400
the biggest thing that holds me back dating

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:12.281
is finding somebody that can match my energy

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.219
you just meet a lot of people that are looking for another mom and you're like

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.440
okay yeah

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.960
no no

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:19.881
I'm not definitely not into that

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:20.881
I've got my own children

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:21.941
like the children

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.520
for as much as people like to blah blah

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:24.741
blah talk shit on the internet

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.600
no there's not um

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:31.741
a shortage of men that are willing to line up for literally any woman

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.080
so the issue isn't gonna be finding a partner

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:38.201
it's gonna be finding a partner that you want to date

00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:40.721
so you just have to maintain your boundaries

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:42.721
maintain um

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:44.781
like your like

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.480
figure out the type of person you're looking for

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.041
actually like

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:49.201
become that person

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:51.841
you know be the type of person you wanna hang out with yourself

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:53.441
be the kind of person that you

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:57.381
you like and you're gonna attract somebody like that

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.480
and then it'll be easier to kinda sort through

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:02.441
you know you're gonna start to surround people with that energy

00:01:02.442 --> 00:01:02.835
but when you're like
