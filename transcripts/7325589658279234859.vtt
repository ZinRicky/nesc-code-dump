00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.140
This is my concern.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.720
If you want to have long hair,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.660
great. If you like your long hair, amazing.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.120
But don't put your identity into it,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.600
because the only thing that should be defining you

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.560
is your relationship with Jesus Christ.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.840
Jesus. Jesus is it,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.260
dude, that's it.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.440
There's. If you're finding your worth in your value

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.260
and anything other than Jesus,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.200
then that is an idol in your life.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.640
And it was for me for a time.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.540
I remember being in high school and absolutely

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.120
loving the attention that my hair brought me.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.200
Actually, most of my life,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.020
because I didn't really cut my hair until I was

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.620
way out of high school.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.400
I love the attention that my hair brought me, and it.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.360
I took such pride in it.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.760
And then when I had my brain surgery,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.200
my hair started to fall out.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.520
It was extremely.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.800
It was a rough season for me.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.840
It was very difficult.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.000
But I had almost an identity crisis,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.080
because it's like

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.340
this thing makes me special,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.420
and if I don't have this thing,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.140
then what do I have?

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.820
Well, here's the good news.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.680
That's not who I am.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.140
My hair was not who I am.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.900
Jesus defines me.
