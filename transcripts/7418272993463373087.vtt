00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.360
How is this air dry modeling clay different from that?

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:04.881
Let me show you. First of all,

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:06.721
the air dry modeling clay has, like,

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:10.601
a foamy texture, so it is a lot easier to build with.

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:12.041
And this is modeling clay.

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:15.741
It is meant to build creations with and sit and dry.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.320
So the other one, when it dries,

00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:22.841
it all breaks apart. It is not meant to dry out and make creations,

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:25.321
but this is so when it is finished,

00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:26.761
you have this beautiful creation

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:27.921
and the pieces don't fall apart.

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:29.641
It all blends together.

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:33.321
And so it is a really great way for kids to make things

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:35.347
and be able to keep them and play with them later.
