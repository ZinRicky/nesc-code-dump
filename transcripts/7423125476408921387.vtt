Here's how much it cost me to be a content creator last month.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.000
First I had my chat bot software I use

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.341
and then what I use for my link in bio which is Stan Store.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.700
I then paid for some supplies for an upcoming project from Joann

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.500
and then my phone payment,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.380
my photo editing software,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.940
and my email newsletter platform.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.200
I then paid for my video editing app,

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:24.221
Instagram Meta verified, and then some Google storage.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.580
I also ran a bunch of coffee giveaways this month as well.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.160
That brings the total I spent this month at

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:30.161
three hundred and thirty dollars

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:30.921
and forty seven cents.

00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:34.541
And I also had to buy a new phone which I didn't include in the total.
