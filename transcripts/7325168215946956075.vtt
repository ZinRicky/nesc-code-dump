00:00.240 --> 00:03.400
My husband is on a 14 hour flight home right now,

00:03.400 --> 00:05.160
so I decided to surprise

00:05.160 --> 00:07.180
him by making some cinnamon rolls.

00:07.520 --> 00:10.000
He's been asking me to make him some for so long,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
so I thought now is the perfect time.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.480
I added all of my ingredients

00:13.480 --> 00:15.320
for my dough to my Kitchen Aid.

00:15.320 --> 00:19.000
I made sure to incorporate everything one at a time

00:19.000 --> 00:20.320
and slowly as well,

00:20.320 --> 00:23.020
just so everything can be needed in properly.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.520
Once my dough was smooth,

00:24.520 --> 00:27.640
I pulled it off the hook and formed into ball

00:27.640 --> 00:29.760
and let that rise for about two hours

00:29.760 --> 00:31.000
until it doubled in size.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
I obviously had to try the dough.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.120
It was delicious.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.520
Then I punched it down to release all the air

00:36.520 --> 00:39.220
and rolled it into what should have been a rectangle.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.520
Once that was rolled out,

00:40.520 --> 00:42.560
I made my cinnamon and sugar mixture

00:42.560 --> 00:45.300
and brushed my dough with a lot of melted butter,

00:45.520 --> 00:47.040
sprinkled my sugar on top,

00:47.040 --> 00:48.240
rolled all of that up,

00:48.240 --> 00:50.840
and then cut it into equal pieces.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.800
I put those pieces into

00:52.800 --> 00:56.360
my baking trays to rise for another 30 to 45 minutes

00:56.360 --> 00:58.660
until they're about double in size.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.000
After 45 minutes,

01:00.000 --> 01:00.760
I checked on them

01:00.760 --> 01:01.680
and they were perfect.

01:01.680 --> 01:02.960
So I popped them in the oven,

01:02.960 --> 01:04.040
and while they were baking,

01:04.040 --> 01:06.080
I made my cream cheese frosting.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.960
And the timing couldn't have been more perfect

01:07.960 --> 01:09.800
because lucky was walking through the door

01:09.800 --> 01:11.440
right as I was pulling these out.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.700
They were perfectly soft. And gooey.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.680
And he ended up having half of that sheet pan.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.980
So I think my surprise was a success.
