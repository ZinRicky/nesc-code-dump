00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.480
I know all the fat acceptance rhetoric

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:03.016
and I know why it's not true 

00:00:03.017 --> 00:00:03.440
mind you

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:04.440
I'm talking about my experiences

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:09.720
these people literally are like foaming at the mouth to try and find me and catch me in a lie

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:11.320
to try and catch other fat people

00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:12.520
like in this big lie

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:15.220
because they have this belief that all fat people

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.840
people who are fat acceptance people are like

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:17.840
lying and we're trying to like

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:19.520
manipulate our audience or whatever

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.920
and it's like I I know where these people are coming from like

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.000
these anti fat acceptance like

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.080
Youtubers or pages or like

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:24.560
literally whatever

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:27.200
because they all say the same thing when they come into my page

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:29.980
and they all do this thing where they genuinely

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.080
they think that everything that I'm saying is a lie

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:34.680
mind you I am literally just speaking about my experience

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:37.760
I'm literally just trying to live in the world as a fat person

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:39.920
I'm trying to be okay and comfortable in my body

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:44.360
and these people genuinely get so angry because they

00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:46.880
they are made to think they are manipulating

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.480
into thinking that I am some manipulative person that is lying

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:50.480
and that I'm not actually confident

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:51.360
that I actually hate myself

00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:53.220
and I'm trying to what

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.920
manipulate people into being okay with their body or oh

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.040
promote obesity which like

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.900
what does that mean if you wanna worry about someone promoting obesity

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.120
get mad at the food industry

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:01.691
United States 

00:01:01.692 --> 00:01:03.040
at all the corn syrup in our food

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:05.160
at all the corporations that are literally

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:07.040
like pouring sugar into everything that we eat

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:08.920
don't get mad at me when I talk

00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:11.080
I'm not saying I want you to become fatter

00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:12.640
my goal is to make you fat

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:16.320
literally my only goal is to make people okay in the bodies that they exist in

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:17.960
I just want you to be happy as you are

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:19.547
and that is literally 

00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:21.280
literally all I wanna do

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:22.080
that's it sorry

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.160
I have no interest in hating my body for the rest of my life

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:25.920
I apologize if that's an inconvenience for you

00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:27.102
but your feelings are not my problem
