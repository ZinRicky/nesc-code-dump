00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
I was trying to be on a health kick

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:04.041
and I bought. I bought it.

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:07.421
My money. I bought the mushroom coffee,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.880
but I bought it from the TikTok app.

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:10.921
This is my review.

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:15.521
I wanna know some tips and tricks on how to make it taste better,

00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:17.261
cause it just has.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.400
Hmm. It's.

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.341
It's giving a little too much.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.360
I do like,

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.241
it's 2,000 milligrams of mushrooms,

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:27.801
and it's shiitake, Turkey tail,

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.041
king trumpet, lions meal, rice,

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:31.081
you courtesy, it's all the good shit.

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:34.321
And then it does have instant coffee in it,

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:35.601
so it does have, like, caffeine,

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:36.941
like half a cup of caffeine.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.700
But how are you ladies mixing it?

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.060
If you wanna try it, it is here in the TikTok shop.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.580
And then maybe you could let me know how you're making it taste good,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.820
you know what I mean?
