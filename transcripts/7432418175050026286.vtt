00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
Okay, I'm gonna mostly skip over the first part of this,

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:05.521
cause it just cracks me up how, like,

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:09.281
a lot of men think that we dead

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:11.321
seriously believe that they're.

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:14.101
They're all suddenly women sports advocates.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.880
There's nothing to do with the fact

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.401
that they view this as an opportunity

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:18.481
to villainize trans people.

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:19.881
So setting that part aside,

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:21.521
the second silly question.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:25.061
Are you okay with Hennepin dictating the whole state's outcome?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.880
Am I okay with the areas where all the people are, um,

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:35.061
having a disproportionate impact on the election?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.820
Because people vote, land doesn't vote.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.360
It's like, you know,

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:41.601
in the office, that time when Stanley's like,

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:43.721
I'm okay with the logic of it.

00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:44.961
That's me. Yeah,

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:47.181
I'm completely fine with the logic of that.
