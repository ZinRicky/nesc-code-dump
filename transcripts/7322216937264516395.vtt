00:00.120 --> 00:02.080
I'm a crunchy mom, of course.

00:02.080 --> 00:04.540
I use non toxic laundry detergent.

00:04.680 --> 00:06.360
I'm a crunchy mom, of course.

00:06.360 --> 00:07.400
If you come to my house,

00:07.400 --> 00:09.780
you're gonna see me breastfeeding 24 7.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.640
I'm a crunchy mom, of course.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.240
We spent our whole day outside

00:13.240 --> 00:14.740
and walk barefoot outside.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.160
I'm a crunchy mom, of course.

00:17.160 --> 00:20.740
Our medicine cabinet is full of herbal tinctures

00:20.760 --> 00:22.160
and natural remedies.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.440
Crunchy mom, of course.

I'm a crunchy mom, of course.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.000
I cooked a majority of our foods from scratch because I

00:30.000 --> 00:32.780
cannot trust a single package in the grocery store.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.440
I'm a crunchy mom, of course.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.280
I own all crunchy books.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.680

00:41.680 --> 00:43.600

00:43.600 --> 00:44.980
without fluoride in it.
