00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.040
I have five different chronic illnesses,

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:04.801
and my husband has been on a weight loss journey the last few years

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:06.401
and has lost about 80 pounds.

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:06.761
And so

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:09.121
these are some things that are some non negotiables in our house.

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:11.721
We switch from seed oils to more natural fats.

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:15.401
We use cast iron skillets and stainless steel pans,

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:19.161
and then I use Castor soap to clean everything in our household.

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.081
Another thing that's really important,

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:22.561
important to Jacob and I is getting holistic therapies done,

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:24.821
and it has been so good for both of us.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.400
Jacob did the magnusphere here,

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:30.761
and I did some brain training along with some chiropractic work,

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:32.561
which is so necessary.

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:34.321
Everything that we've implemented in our marriage

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:37.521
is exercising together. Whether that be walking,

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:39.281
running, or playing pickleball,

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:41.201
we like to stay very active together.

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:45.521
The last switch that we've made is more natural caffeines like matcha.

00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:48.501
I've been on matcha obsession this year,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.960
and it has not disappointed in the slightest.

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:53.161
I am obsessed with matcha.

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:54.416
