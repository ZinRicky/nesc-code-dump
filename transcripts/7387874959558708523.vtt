My husband hasn't been home in a few days,

00:02.201 --> 00:04.761
but he's gonna be home in about four hours,

00:04.762 --> 00:08.361
so I decided to surprise him with a variation of one of his favorite

00:08.362 --> 00:10.081
desserts, which are cinnamon rolls.

00:10.082 --> 00:12.081
I had a bunch of raspberries at home,

00:12.082 --> 00:14.981
so I decided to make some raspberry lemon rolls.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.960
Started with my dough by combining some milk, sugar,

00:17.961 --> 00:18.881
butter, eggs,

00:18.882 --> 00:21.281
and then gradually adding in my flour.

00:21.282 --> 00:24.401
I made sure to mix it very well until it was all combined

00:24.402 --> 00:28.281
before pouring it out onto my counter and starting to knead it.

00:28.282 --> 00:30.441
I needed it for about eight to 10 minutes

00:30.442 --> 00:32.681
until it was all smooth and came together

00:32.682 --> 00:35.001
before placing it in a bowl to rise.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.681
After about two hours, it had doubled in size,

00:37.682 --> 00:40.981
so I released all the air and then started on my filling.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.600
Kept this very simple with some brown sugar,

00:43.601 --> 00:45.881
cornstarch, and some frozen raspberries.

00:45.882 --> 00:49.321
Gave that a mix before sprinkling that all over my dough.

00:49.322 --> 00:51.481
I tried to get it as even as possible

00:51.482 --> 00:54.961
and then rolled it up and sliced it into equal pieces.

00:54.962 --> 00:58.121
I buttered my baking tray and placed my rolls inside,

00:58.122 --> 01:00.921
making sure that they weren't too close to each other,

01:00.922 --> 01:02.641
before covering them in cling film

01:02.642 --> 01:05.361
and letting them rise for another hour and a half.

01:05.362 --> 01:07.281
At this point, I preheated my oven

01:07.282 --> 01:10.001
and placed some more raspberries on top of my rolls

01:10.002 --> 01:13.161
before popping them in the oven for about 30 minutes.

01:13.162 --> 01:15.801
Bake them until they were golden brown and let them cool

01:15.802 --> 01:17.601
while I started on my frosting

01:17.602 --> 01:19.201
with some cream cheese, milk,

01:19.202 --> 01:20.841
powdered sugar, lemon zest,

01:20.842 --> 01:23.221
vanilla, and a squeeze of lemon juice.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.540
I mixed that all up and then spread that on top of my rolls.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.800
30 minutes later, lucky walked through the door,

01:28.801 --> 01:31.561
so it was perfect timing. I plated him one,

01:31.562 --> 01:33.621
and he absolutely loved it.
