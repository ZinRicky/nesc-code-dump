00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.320
if my man doesn't like it or agree with it

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:03.761
I'm not doing it

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:07.701
I know there are Gen z's out there screaming right now

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.160
but that's my man

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:10.501
that's my fiance

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.640
that's my best friend

00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:12.921
that my life partner

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:14.521
we're each others forever

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:18.261
why would I do something that my man doesn't agree with or want me to do

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.960
I don’t know where things got misunderstood in this generation

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:24.401
but your partner is supposed to be above everyone

00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:25.761
above everything

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:27.881
why would you do something that they don't agree with

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:29.621
or makes them feel uncomfortable

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.680
they have your best interest at heart

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:33.541
so you know it's coming from a good place

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.880
when they tell you

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:36.661
I don't think you should do that

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:37.909
you shouldn't do it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.361
do you understand

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:41.498
like they have your best interest at heart

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:42.614
plain and simple

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:43.978
if my man doesn't like it

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:45.243
I'm not doing it

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:46.349
if he doesn't agree with it

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.679
I'm not doing it

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.762
it’s out of basic respect and the relationship

00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:52.993
I don’t know where things got lost in translation
