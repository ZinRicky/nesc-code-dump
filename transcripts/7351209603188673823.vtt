00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.120
for months now

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:05.081
I've been trying and failing to figure out a way to wear my gold because like

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:07.481
I'm Egyptian I should be a gold girly

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:08.361
but like I

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:09.121
I wear silver

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:10.541
I'm a silver girl through and through

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.580
but like as an Egyptian

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.840
for baptisms for like holidays whatever

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:16.241
like we get gold

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:19.081
so I have gold that I've gotten from my family

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:22.481
they've literally never worn because I just didn't know how to

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:26.161
so this is my first actual attempt and I'm gonna wear this out

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:27.261
i'mma be really brave

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.080
but it's still

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:29.241
there's still something missing

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:34.421
I'm trying to layer it because the thing is my nose ring is silver and my

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.000
these two are silver

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.181
and this is silver

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.700
can you see this is silver

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.060
these are silver

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.040
but I got these gold earrings for Christmas and I found these um

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:47.041
this I got this summer in Egypt

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.761
it had a bigger cross on it

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:49.641
every time I get golden

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:51.561
Egypt is usually a cross or some sort

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:52.641
so I have a lot

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:53.841
but I'm trying to

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:54.601
I'm just trying

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:56.801
okay this is basically what I came up with

00:00:56.802 --> 00:00:58.721
this is my baby ring from

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:00.241
you know when I was a kid

00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:02.261
um this is a cross

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.480
and these are silver

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.281
so I don't I still don't know what to do though

00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:07.841
cause it's still

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:09.681
something is missing and I don't know what

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:11.441
this is Sterling silver that's like

00:01:11.442 --> 00:01:12.081
plated with gold

00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:13.441
this is just not gold

00:01:13.442 --> 00:01:17.681
but whatever and I put these two gold bracelets on my stack

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:20.881
I just there's something missing and I don't know what else to do

00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:25.081
but I really I wanna pull it off and I just don't know what to do

00:01:25.082 --> 00:01:26.521
so if you have any suggestions

00:01:26.522 --> 00:01:27.601
please let me know

00:01:27.602 --> 00:01:28.831
I wanna be a gold girl so bad
