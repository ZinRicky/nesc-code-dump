00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.880
So if you're not new here,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.420
you know that I like to cook everything sourdough.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.680
I'm a stay at home mom

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.320
and do all of the cooking at home.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.260
But on the times when I'm not home,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.360
I need something in the pantry,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.320
a quick backup

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.340
for my husband to cook something for the kids.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.920
So I came across this.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.680
Just a sourdough pancake mix.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.900
I wanna give it a try.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.000
I went with the original one today,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.940
as I have some buttermilk

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.960
leftover for making raw butter yesterday

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.260
and I wanted to use it up before it went bad.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.480
So at this point,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.160
my husband would probably just use water,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.900
as he wouldn't know buttermilk from his elbow.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.020
But anywho, we're gonna throw in four eggs

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.420
and give that a mix.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.960
At this point,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.800
I'd already made a nice stack of pancakes,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.560
but my son requested some chocolate chips,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.860
so I threw those in.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.060
And. Delightful.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.000
I would definitely recommend.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.600
She has a great ingredients list.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.700
Go check Jess's out on TikTok.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.660
Kid approved.
