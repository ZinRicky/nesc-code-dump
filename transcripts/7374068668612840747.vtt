00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
People always ask me why I'm sober

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.520
They think my life is boring or they think I'm missing out on life

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:06.920
that's not how I feel

00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:10.833
life genuinely got better when I stopped drinking 

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:12.320
and wasting my time

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:15.760
my energy, my money, on alcohol

00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:18.522
and wasted conversations with people who 

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:20.880
never gave me a genuine connection

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:24.720
conversation or overall substance in my life

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.600
So no, I'm not missing out on anything

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.000
Drinking isn't what life is about

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.320
Drinking isn't fun

00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:36.100
Drinking will NEVER bring true happiness into anybody's life

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.240
Alcohol is literally poison

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:39.400
it's a depressant

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:42.320
The only thing I'm missing out on is a hangover

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:44.580
and am I really missing out?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.360
I would say that

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:50.520
people are finally waking up and learning that drinking isn't what life is about

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:53.720
people are waking up and getting smart about their health

00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:56.000
Which is honestly a good thing

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:59.080
Instead of letting society tell them drinking every weekend

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:01.120
or partying is normal,

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:02.459
adds value to your life?

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.547
 because it truly doesn't
