List of things that men love hearing part 2 

00:04.371 --> 00:07.440
No. 6 “thank you for always listening to my drama”

00:07.441 --> 00:10.680
we all know that men don't care to talk about every little detail

00:10.681 --> 00:14.200
throughout their day so when you have a man that would gladly listen to you

00:14.201 --> 00:16.320
thank him and appreciate him

00:16.321 --> 00:17.820
and honestly marry him

00:17.821 --> 00:20.144
7 “wow, you look so buff today” 

00:20.145 --> 00:22.840
even if he's not built like a bodybuilder

00:22.841 --> 00:25.120
he's likely to appreciate the sentiment

00:25.121 --> 00:29.400
or if he's been putting extra work in the gym and he's starting to see progress

00:29.401 --> 00:32.439
never neglect to notice the progress that he's making

00:32.440 --> 00:34.480
No. 8 “I love your haircut”

00:34.481 --> 00:37.200
it's not just women who like this compliment

00:37.201 --> 00:38.360
men love it too

00:38.361 --> 00:41.624
so if he has a fresh cut make sure to acknowledge it and

00:41.625 --> 00:42.703
tell him that he looks good
