00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
If you're shocked at the price of meat when you go grocery shopping,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.060
consider this a solution to your problems.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.400
After much deliberation,

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:10.161
we decided to finally add rabbits to our homestead.

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:13.521
And here's why. We currently raise pasture raised chicken

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:15.041
and it is not a sustainable option.

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:16.361
Although we love raising chickens,

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:19.721
you have to continuously buy this cross breed that makes good meat

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:22.601
birds from hatcheries. So it's not something that you can do yourself.

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:25.101
So not sustainable. And it's a really easy to breed.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.200
You can multiply the amount of rabbits you have

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:28.961
in a pretty short space of time.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.561
And if you're used to raising livestock,

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:32.241
they are pretty easy to look after.

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:34.761
Now we already have a source of dairy on our farm,

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:38.081
so I really would like a continuous source of meat

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:40.381
that I don't have to outsource from our farm.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.280
Now rabbit is really easy to cook.

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:44.241
There's plenty of recipes out there.

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:47.681
Here I'm trying a French mustard sauce rabbit and it is really good.

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:49.921
We are not used to eating rabbit that much in the west,

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:52.961
but I am from England and in a few generations back,

00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:56.361
rabbit was a totally normal thing to eat on a weekly basis,

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:56.801
although

00:00:56.802 --> 00:01:01.321
I wasn't really wanting to have something cute and fluffy to eat.

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:03.921
Now I've processed them myself

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:06.881
and I've used their drop ins in the garden.

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:09.041
I can really see the benefit of having them,

00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:10.661
how they're very sustainable

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.480
and how They're a good fit for anybody

00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:14.191
who's wanting to produce their own food.
