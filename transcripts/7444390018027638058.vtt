London is one of my favourite places

00:01.841 --> 00:03.801
and every time I get a chance to go,

00:03.802 --> 00:06.521
I take it. When I got invited to the bfa's,

00:06.522 --> 00:08.721
I obviously did not say no.

00:08.722 --> 00:12.321
Landed the night before and the next day we got started on glam.

00:12.322 --> 00:13.601
Love a good fashion moment,

00:13.602 --> 00:15.081
and if the hair needs to be cut,

00:15.082 --> 00:18.281
it's getting cut. I was in glam for about three hours,

00:18.282 --> 00:20.761
took a little break, and once it was time to go,

00:20.762 --> 00:23.121
we started putting on the dress and the shoes.

00:23.122 --> 00:25.281
I wore the most stunning dress by H M.

00:25.282 --> 00:27.161
Studio that just dropped today,

00:27.162 --> 00:30.641
by the way. After taking all the pictures and glam shots,

00:30.642 --> 00:32.481
it was time for us to head out.

00:32.482 --> 00:33.761
Everytime I'm back in London,

00:33.762 --> 00:36.321
I get reminded of exactly how cold it is,

00:36.322 --> 00:38.201
and I was definitely freezing,

00:38.202 --> 00:40.521
but it was all worth it. Once we arrived,

00:40.522 --> 00:42.041
I met so many of you guys,

00:42.042 --> 00:44.141
which always makes me so happy.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.640
This is the last carpet of the year,

00:45.641 --> 00:47.561
which made it so much more special.

00:47.562 --> 00:49.041
Love bumping into my friends

00:49.042 --> 00:52.161
because they make me feel so much more comfortable in these settings.

00:52.162 --> 00:54.121
After talking to all the news outlets,

00:54.122 --> 00:57.281
I made my way up. So glad I didn't wear my glasses,

00:57.282 --> 01:00.881
because that definitely helps with my nerves not being able to see.

01:00.882 --> 01:02.881
Once we were seated, the awards started,

01:02.882 --> 01:05.273
and I'm so happy for Alex and everyone else.
