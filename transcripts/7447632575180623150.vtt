00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
Gonna go to bed. Last night,

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:06.961
I could not stop thinking about a matcha that had a Poppy in it.

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:09.281
I don't know why, but I couldn't stop thinking about it.

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:11.281
And then it LED me to TikTok,

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.841
and I was like, has anyone tried this?

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:17.201
Has anyone done this? And a few people have,

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:20.401
but I haven't. And so the fact that other people have tried it

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:23.721
and they had a good experience made me feel good about trying it.

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.361
So we're going to do a strawberry,

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:29.941
lemon, Poppy with some matcha in it today. Let's give it a go.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.140
Not much.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.340
Let's mix it up and give it a try.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.340
I can taste the matcha. It's really good.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.660
This would be, like a perfect summery drink.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.000
I think that it's also missing a little something.

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:53.861
I think I might add a little maple syrup.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.060
That's really good.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.880
Okay.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.960
I think I wanna try it with,

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:02.781
like, a.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.880
I got orange cream. I think the orange cream would be really good,

00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:08.761
but I'm not mad about this.

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:12.341
Out of 10, I give it a seven and a half.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.400
I love trying new things with matcha.

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.021
So, so fun.
