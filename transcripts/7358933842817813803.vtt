00:00.240 --> 00:04.460
These are some baby names I loved, but I didn't use this time around.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.160
For reference,

00:05.161 --> 00:07.001
our kids have pretty unique names.

00:07.002 --> 00:09.321
Our daughter's name is Rumble Honey Smith,

00:09.322 --> 00:11.401
our son's name is Slim Easy Smith,

00:11.402 --> 00:14.861
and then we just had little whimsy Lou Smith.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.760
So these might be a little out there.

00:16.761 --> 00:18.501
A little bit more controversial,

00:18.760 --> 00:21.480
but in case someone needs any ideas for their kids.

00:21.481 --> 00:23.161
These are some girls names that I loved.

00:23.162 --> 00:25.301
We were almost gonna name her tank.

00:25.680 --> 00:30.060
And then I love the name Bo, as in bow as a second name.

00:30.080 --> 00:33.320
I also really liked fruit names, so I love the name Lemon,

00:33.321 --> 00:35.121
Plum and Clementine.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.921
Also really liked Pippin or Pip for short,

00:37.922 --> 00:39.781
Dottie or dot for short,

00:39.840 --> 00:43.980
and then Ivy as well, just because that would have almost been my name.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.100
And then for boys.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.240
Boys are a little bit trickier to name in my opinion.

00:49.241 --> 00:51.741
But we had the name Halo on our list,

00:51.840 --> 00:55.940
thus also do Mercer and flick.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.840
So yeah, those were some names that we didn't end up using,

00:58.841 --> 01:00.901
but that were still on my list.
