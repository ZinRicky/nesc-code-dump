When these mini sourdough bagels came across my feet,

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:04.561
I knew I had to give them a try.

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:06.721
My husband absolutely loves bagels,

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:10.841
and for some reason I have never attempted to make them until now.

00:00:10.842 --> 00:00:14.361
This is our first attempt of making not just bagels,

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:15.481
but sourdough bagels.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.561
I've talked about this before,

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:18.241
but I have a gluten sensitivity,

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:19.201
but for some reason,

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:22.321
Italian flour does not affect me the way normal flour does.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:25.081
So I made these with Italian flower,

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:27.721
and I think I flatten them out a little too much.

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:31.201
Next time I'm definitely not going to flatten them as much as I did,

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:34.441
but they still turned out absolutely beautiful.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:38.291
And they were so yummy for Jake and I to eat this morning. He was happy.
