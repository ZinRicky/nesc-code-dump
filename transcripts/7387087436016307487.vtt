00:00.400 --> 00:03.920
This is what I typically eat in a day as a recipe mom

00:03.921 --> 00:06.061
and a mom nourishing herself. Preconception.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.280
So starting off I always have three eggs,

00:08.281 --> 00:11.361
my homemade sourdough bread with grass fed butter and pasture

00:11.362 --> 00:13.921
a sausage. Then I was in my ovulation phase,

00:13.922 --> 00:17.301
so afterwards I had a raw milk Yogi coffee.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.900
Then I have my supplements called liver oil,

00:20.920 --> 00:25.660
beef liver, and I have some bruises for foliage and all the good stuff.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.080
Then as a morning snack, I have a protein shake,

00:29.081 --> 00:32.401
raw milk protein shake packed with grass fed whey protein,

00:32.402 --> 00:34.021
B pollen, all the nutrients.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.120
For lunch I had homemade yogurt sauce,

00:36.121 --> 00:37.961
grass fed beef, homemade tortillas,

00:37.962 --> 00:43.361
cucumbers and tomatoes. I always like to have my herbal iced tea

00:43.362 --> 00:44.901
with a splash of homemade lemonade

00:45.160 --> 00:49.300
and then my rocker salad in between lunch and my afternoon snack.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.280
Then I had a little bit of kafir kefir,

00:52.281 --> 00:56.401
rock kefir, and then I had my afternoon snack which was raw cheese,

00:56.402 --> 00:57.741
bee pollen, honey,

00:57.800 --> 00:59.180
homemade sourdough crackers,

00:59.400 --> 01:00.640
smoked oysters, cherries,

01:00.641 --> 01:02.621
and a seaweed snack.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.340
Then for dinner I had homemade meat sauce with raw cheese and pasta.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.440
As a bedtime snack, I had raw milk with grass fruit,

01:10.441 --> 01:13.761
collagen and colostrum. Then I had a B vitamin and folate

01:13.762 --> 01:16.021
and collagen filled chocolate chip cookie.
