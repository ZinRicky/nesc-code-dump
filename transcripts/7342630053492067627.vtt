00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.560
on my last video about marriage

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:04.600
I had a friend say that marriage is supposed to be your safe place

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.560
and I've never thought about it in those terms before

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:08.000
but she was exactly correct

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.440
there are so many awful things in this life that you were gonna go through

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:13.960
there are so many moments when you were gonna be self conscious

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:15.160
when you were gonna feel low

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:17.140
when you were gonna need propping up

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.280
and you undoubtedly are gonna go through some hard stuff

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:22.960
and marriage can be this beautiful gift that you give yourself

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:26.160
it is supposed to be the person that you can come to with all of your ails

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:26.760
your worries

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.640
your woes, your insecurities

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:31.820
and work through them and be supported and loved

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.160
and that's not to say that you can't get that in other relationships

00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:38.160
but the added element of that lifelong commitment

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:43.060
that lifelong promise to each other to show up till death do you part

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.360
allows some of that reassurance that even if you are your worst self

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:50.140
sometimes they're gonna help you get through it

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.840
now I understand that that is not everybody's reality

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:56.240
and divorce exists in astronomical numbers for a very good reason

00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:57.240
but there is that like

00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:59.920
glimmer of hope and optimism when it comes to marriage

00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:02.040
that doesn't exist in other relationships

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.600
I have Learned so much about myself

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.180
and so much about the good in the world through being married

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.420
marriage should feel like a warm blanket

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.900
like coming home

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.440
and if it doesn't

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:14.460
don't do it because it's still legally binding
