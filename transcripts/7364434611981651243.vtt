00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.840
I have to keep a stash of the drink that I like on hand,

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:07.561
because what I like to do is get one and act like I'm gonna drink it.

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:08.201
This is caffeine.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:11.881
It's got 150 milligrams of caffeine.

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:13.081
And it's tea. It's not coffee.

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:13.981
I don't like coffee.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.740
I have to keep a stash of them in my refrigerator,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.120
because I like to grab one,

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:19.081
act like I'm gonna drink it,

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:20.041
and then I set it down.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:21.561
Um, the coffee table,

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:24.801
I never open it until it gets room temperature warm,

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:25.721
and then I'm like,

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:26.441
I don't want to drink that,

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:28.381
so I have to go get another one.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.420
But they're really good.
