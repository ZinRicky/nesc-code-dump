00:00.080 --> 00:01.760
Here's everything I eat in a day.

00:01.760 --> 00:03.440
As someone that loves to cook

00:03.440 --> 00:05.360
but is also 30 weeks pregnant,

00:05.360 --> 00:06.720
I hate the taste of water

00:06.720 --> 00:08.920
so I always need to add stuff to it.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.780
Today it was cucumber and mint.

00:10.920 --> 00:14.320
I also wake up craving fresh orange juice everyday.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.320
So today I made a grapefruit orange juice.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.840
Got started on making some wild blueberry compote

00:19.840 --> 00:22.940
to go alongside my cassava flour waffles.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.640
These are so easy to make

00:24.640 --> 00:26.800
and they always turn out so crispy

00:26.800 --> 00:28.200
but chewy in the middle.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.240
They're my favorite thing,

00:29.240 --> 00:31.200
so I ended up having two of those

00:31.200 --> 00:33.240
with my blueberry compote.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.520
So good! And then for a midday beverage,

00:35.520 --> 00:37.720
you guys know I always need to have one.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.820
I made a vanilla blueberry iced tea,

00:40.960 --> 00:42.680
started on making some lunch,

00:42.680 --> 00:45.520
and chopped up some green onions and lemongrass

00:45.520 --> 00:49.540
to go inside my Vietnamese pork lemongrass meatballs.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.000
I seared those off

00:51.000 --> 00:54.300
and then got started on making my vermicelli salad.

00:54.440 --> 00:57.080
I Julian some carrots and some cucumber,

00:57.080 --> 00:58.600
made a nok chom dressing,

00:58.600 --> 01:01.440
and then assembled it all with some fresh herbs.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.700
Don't forget the mint,

01:02.760 --> 01:03.640
my meatballs,

01:03.640 --> 01:04.580
the noodles!

01:04.840 --> 01:06.200
This was so refreshing

01:06.200 --> 01:08.180
but feeling at the same time

01:08.240 --> 01:09.440
in the afternoon.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.440
Needed a little sweet pick me up. So

01:11.440 --> 01:14.780
I made a lime whipped cream to go inside of my papaya.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.640
Dinner was something easy and quick

01:16.640 --> 01:18.560
so made a roast chicken.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.360
I spatchcock my chicken

01:20.360 --> 01:23.360
and then made a little gochujang marinade to go

01:23.360 --> 01:24.360
All over it.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.120
Love a roast chicken

01:25.120 --> 01:27.160
because you can just make it pop in the oven

01:27.160 --> 01:28.960
and forget about it for a few hours.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.760
And I cut up some root vegetables,

01:30.760 --> 01:32.640
toss them in the leftover marinade,

01:32.640 --> 01:33.920
and then laid my chicken

01:33.920 --> 01:36.000
on top of some onion and garlic.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.480
I added some chicken stock to my cast iron

01:38.480 --> 01:39.740
and put that in the oven.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.200
That was almost done.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.720
I made a garlic yuzu spinach,

01:43.720 --> 01:46.080
and then I pulled out my beautiful chicken,

01:46.080 --> 01:47.700
carved myself up a piece,

01:47.840 --> 01:49.000
and that was my dinner.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.014
I love something comforting to end my day.
