00:00.120 --> 00:00.720
This morning

00:00.720 --> 00:02.560
my toddler stumbled into my room

00:02.560 --> 00:05.000
and her first words were PB and J.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.680
So that's exactly what I got started on growing up.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.480
I loved having fresh bread.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.760
It was one of my favorite things.

00:10.760 --> 00:11.880
So I get it

00:11.880 --> 00:14.320
started by making a really simple sandwich bread

00:14.320 --> 00:15.160
with some yeast,

00:15.160 --> 00:17.340
water, salt, sugar, and flour.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.280
Kneaded that until a dough formed,

00:19.280 --> 00:22.200
and then let that dough rise for about two hours

00:22.200 --> 00:23.520
until it doubled in size.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.540
I started on my raspberry jam.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.000
I use some lemon monk fruit sweetener,

00:28.000 --> 00:29.400
but you can also use sugar

00:29.400 --> 00:31.360
and some cornstarch to thicken it.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.320
While that was going,

00:32.320 --> 00:33.880
I started on my peanut butter.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.000
I roasted all my peanuts in the oven

00:36.000 --> 00:38.040
and then ground them up with some sea salt

00:38.040 --> 00:39.900
until a paste formed.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.960
You can definitely add honey to this if you want to.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.680
I didn't today because the jelly would be quite sweet.

00:45.680 --> 00:46.520
So by this time,

00:46.520 --> 00:48.520
my brand was doubled in size.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.600
So I punched it to release all the air

00:50.600 --> 00:52.120
and then split it into

00:52.120 --> 00:53.000
rolled that out

00:53.000 --> 00:55.840
and then folded that over to fit in my loaf pans.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.480
I let that rest for another 30 minutes to about an hour

00:59.480 --> 01:02.600
until it looked like a decent size in my loaf pan,

01:02.600 --> 01:04.700
and then I popped that in the oven

01:04.920 --> 01:08.120
and it came out so perfectly brown,

01:08.120 --> 01:09.200
soft in the middle.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.240
I was so excited,

01:10.240 --> 01:10.960
I couldn't wait.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.780
So I definitely sliced it a little Too early.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.580
My daughter requested a mini PB and J.

01:16.760 --> 01:17.800
I cut the bread down

01:17.800 --> 01:20.200
and spread it with my peanut butter and jelly,

01:20.200 --> 01:21.400
cut it diagonally,

01:21.400 --> 01:23.080
and this was really good.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.147
She ended up having a few of them and wanted more.
