00:00.080 --> 00:01.840
We're doing a tea tasting.

00:01.841 --> 00:03.361
Tea is one of my favourite things.

00:03.362 --> 00:05.521
Lucky just got around to it a while ago.

00:05.522 --> 00:08.201
My sister ordered from this tea company called Tea Pigs,

00:08.202 --> 00:09.921
and they have so many different flavours,

00:09.922 --> 00:13.041
so I had to order some and it got a little out of.

00:13.042 --> 00:15.161
So now I'm making lucky try all of them.

00:15.162 --> 00:17.241
Just a little out of hand here.

00:17.242 --> 00:19.801
These are all the teas we're working with.

00:19.802 --> 00:22.181
Spiced pear, rhubarb, ginger,

00:22.200 --> 00:23.360
lemon, ginger,

00:23.361 --> 00:24.701
chocolate, mint,

00:24.960 --> 00:27.860
red winter tea, apple, cinnamon,

00:28.240 --> 00:31.320
roybis caramel. And the red fruit tea.

00:31.321 --> 00:33.741
This is roybis cream caramel.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.840
It smells so good to me. I love a good,

00:36.841 --> 00:39.181
robust tea. It's one of my favourite teas ever.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.300
Stunning. Just stunning.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.560
We didn't sweeten any of them.

00:44.561 --> 00:45.121
And usually

00:45.122 --> 00:49.081
lucky likes his tea so sweet that you don't even know what the tea is.

00:49.082 --> 00:51.521
So I'm curious how this is gonna go.

00:51.522 --> 00:53.581
Good. It's good.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.980
Six and a half. Oh, okay.

00:56.440 --> 01:01.540
This tea is ginger rhubarb. So interesting.

01:02.920 --> 01:06.540
Tart. That's actually really good. Holy crap.

01:10.760 --> 01:14.460
4. This is solid eight for me. Four.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.540
Have you ever had rhubarb, though?

01:16.600 --> 01:18.080
No. Okay, okay,

01:18.081 --> 01:20.741
that makes sense. Lemon, ginger.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.780
Lucky has very high hopes.

01:23.000 --> 01:23.800
High hopes.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.420
I'm underwhelmed.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.920
Very underwhelmed. This is water.

01:28.921 --> 01:30.701
To me, it tastes like hot water.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.980
What did we mix it?

01:36.400 --> 01:38.160
Mediocre. A one out of 10.

01:38.161 --> 01:39.481
Wow, that's pretty low.

01:39.482 --> 01:41.481
What is it for you? It's literally just water.

01:41.482 --> 01:43.121
Oh, this one's next.

01:43.122 --> 01:44.881
What's this one? Oh,

01:44.882 --> 01:49.981
spiced winter red tea. It smells very like cinnamon.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.160
Like warm. It smells very warm,

01:52.161 --> 01:53.501
like winter, you know?

01:53.640 --> 01:55.180
Really taste the cinnamon?

01:55.320 --> 01:56.940
I can really taste the red.

01:58.000 --> 01:58.600
Um. Yep,

01:58.601 --> 01:59.421
yep,

02:00.320 --> 02:02.740
yep. Seven out of 10 or six.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.240
Apple cinnamon. Oh,

02:04.241 --> 02:08.421
I'm excited. I used to drink apple tea when I was younger all the time,

02:08.600 --> 02:11.020
so I'm excited for this one.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.040
Apple tea, you guys,

02:15.041 --> 02:18.721
is so underrated. That's a nine out of 10.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.841
That's so good. You can taste the apple.

02:20.842 --> 02:23.881
The cinnamon is literally just the tiniest hint.

02:23.882 --> 02:25.601
That's nice. You like it?

02:25.602 --> 02:26.621
Eight out of 10.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.660
Wow. Chocolate mint.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.620
It smells like mint chocolate to me, which is concerning.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.820
That tastes like mint chocolate.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.800
Holy crap. Yes, I.

02:39.801 --> 02:41.661
I mean, if you like mint chocolate.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.220
Yeah. It's doing what it's supposed to be doing.

02:46.720 --> 02:47.860
It's good, though.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.060
Red fruit.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.120
I love a fruity Berry tea.

02:52.121 --> 02:54.181
These are very nostalgic as well.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.400
Berry tart. Yes,

02:56.401 --> 02:58.941
you can. It's very Berry tart.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.880
Not sweet at all. You don't like that?

03:01.881 --> 03:04.541
Don't like it. That's a solid seven.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.560
No, no, no.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.721
Spiced pear. I actually.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.561
I'm not gonna lie. I had this the other night.

03:10.562 --> 03:12.341
It was really good. It's.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.140
I'm gonna let you try it first, actually,

03:14.440 --> 03:16.060
cause it's very surprising.

03:17.520 --> 03:21.220
I like it. That's an 8 for me. Okay.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.820
Do you get this spice? Yep.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.760
Like, you swallow it and you just feel the spice.

03:28.761 --> 03:30.481
I think it has chili in it.

03:30.482 --> 03:33.801
It's very warm. If you don't like spicy,

03:33.802 --> 03:35.961
I wouldn't get it. So what was your favorite one?

03:35.962 --> 03:37.601
The spicy one. Really?

03:37.602 --> 03:38.401
Yeah.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.160
Okay. What's your second favourite?

03:40.161 --> 03:44.561
I don't remember. Rhubarb and ginger one was a surprising underdog.

03:44.562 --> 03:45.761
Like, I didn't think I would like it,

03:45.762 --> 03:47.401
and I really enjoyed it. Um,

03:47.402 --> 03:49.061
I'm gonna have the rest of these teas.
