WEBVTT


00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.380
you will never believe the song you chose for this wegovy ad

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.580
have you also trouble with your weight

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.080
same discover the power of Wegovy

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:13.340
with Wegovy I lost 35 pounds and some lost over 46 pounds

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.045
and I'm keeping weight off 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.920
they took this is me but instead of this is me

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:20.224
they said Wegovy

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:23.160
 for context this is the music video

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.600
what I remember of this film

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:12.240
it was basically much people who were ostized from society

00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:15.520
they became carnies because they weren't accepted literally anywhere else

00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:17.840
people hated them and feared them because of their appearance

00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:19.400
because it looks different than everyone else

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:22.320
right so this is a ballad about radical self acceptance

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.160
like they're like

00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:24.480
I don't care if the world judges me

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:25.720
like this is who I am

00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:27.280
I'm standing in myself like

00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:29.400
I am comfortable and I'm happy with myself

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:30.880
this is who I am right

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:32.740
and the person who's singing the song

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.480
this is Bearded Fat Lady which

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:37.600
you know I was eating up because I love fat representation anyways

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:38.480
she's like this is me

00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:39.960
I'm fat this is what I look like

00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:41.560
you know owning herself

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:44.320
so for wegovy to use this song

00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:47.640
this song in their weight loss drug ad

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:48.600
showing people who are like

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:50.600
talking about how they're finally happy because they're losing weight

00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:53.120
it's like you are sick

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.440
I'm not even talking about wegovy itself

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:56.100
I'm just talking about the ad

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.800
that is so sinister 

00:01:58.801 --> 00:01:59.247
and evil

00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:02.600
 turning a self acceptance ballad into an ad for weight loss

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:04.320
and not even just using the song

00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:08.660
but modifying it to go from this is me to Wegovy

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.262
you're sick you're so sick
