00:00.040 --> 00:02.880
My husband got home from a four day work trip last night,

00:02.881 --> 00:06.161
so I decided to make us a big family dinner tonight.

00:06.162 --> 00:08.481
Summer always makes me crave Greek food,

00:08.482 --> 00:11.301
so that's exactly what I got started on tonight.

00:11.320 --> 00:15.040
Started by making some pita dough and as soon as it came together,

00:15.041 --> 00:17.361
I turned it out and started kneading it.

00:17.362 --> 00:19.921
Halfway through I got too tired to continue,

00:19.922 --> 00:23.201
so lucky took over since he's really good at kneading dough.

00:23.202 --> 00:25.481
Once it was smooth, I put it in my bowl,

00:25.482 --> 00:28.361
covered it, and let it rise for about two to three hours

00:28.362 --> 00:30.421
while I got started on my lamb.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.280
Making a slow cooked lamb today,

00:32.281 --> 00:34.601
so I stuffed my lamb with some garlic,

00:34.602 --> 00:36.121
some dried and fresh herbs,

00:36.122 --> 00:37.881
some lemon, some onion.

00:37.882 --> 00:40.521
I put that in the oven at a very low temperature

00:40.522 --> 00:42.281
for about six to seven hours

00:42.282 --> 00:44.821
while I got started on my tzatziki.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.920
I combined some homemade Greek yogurt,

00:46.921 --> 00:48.481
shaved cucumber, dill,

00:48.482 --> 00:50.001
red wine vinegar, lemon,

00:50.002 --> 00:51.121
olive oil,

00:51.122 --> 00:54.241
and then popped that in the fridge until it was time for dinner.

00:54.242 --> 00:57.361
And in the meantime, got started on my Greek salad.

00:57.362 --> 00:59.001
It's tomato season right now,

00:59.002 --> 01:01.121
so I had to take advantage of that.

01:01.122 --> 01:02.661
Chopped up all my vegetables,

01:02.880 --> 01:05.399
added some feta cheese, have the dressing.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.281
Very simple. About an hour and a half before dinner was getting served,

01:09.282 --> 01:11.381
I started on my Greek potatoes.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.240
I season those

01:12.241 --> 01:15.321
and then pop them in the oven for about an Hour and a half.

01:15.322 --> 01:17.041
Once my dough had doubled in size,

01:17.042 --> 01:19.561
I sectioned it into eight little balls,

01:19.562 --> 01:22.041
let those rise for about 10 minutes on the counter

01:22.042 --> 01:23.601
before rolling them out.

01:23.602 --> 01:26.741
I then transferred my dough over to a hot skillet,

01:26.800 --> 01:30.600
kept flipping it every 10 to 15 seconds until puffed up,

01:30.601 --> 01:32.841
and I repeated that with all of my pita.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.721
And then it was time to serve dinner.

01:34.722 --> 01:36.721
We had the Greek salads, Ezekiel,

01:36.722 --> 01:38.441
Greek potatoes, some pita,

01:38.442 --> 01:41.357
and the slow roasted lamb. It was so divine.
