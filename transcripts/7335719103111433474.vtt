WEBVTT


00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.289
we had 72 hours to 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.201
completely transform our patio

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:05.115
which technically we would call a deck

00:00:05.116 --> 00:00:05.921
 here in Aotearoa

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:07.521
New Zealand but I know what I sound like

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:09.226
and I don't wanna bang on about how hard it 

00:00:09.227 --> 00:00:10.001
was to give this big

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:11.666
beautiful deck a makeover under the 

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:12.361
beating hot sun

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:14.261
so we're just gonna go with patio

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.079
how good did this railing come up with

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.921
just a bit of spray paint

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:17.441
though anyway

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:19.721
so day 1 and 2 didn't feel all that productive

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:20.281
if I'm honest

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:22.321
day one we were hit with gale force winds and rain

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.481
and day 2 we were hit with

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.589
the shocking realisation that neither one of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.761
us is actually very smart

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:27.841
it was this pattern though

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:29.561
this pattern has a lot to answer for

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.321
and I know it doesn't look like there's a pattern

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.641
but apparently there is anyway

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:35.361
it wasn't until my husband lugged 500 kgs of tiles

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:37.661
that's about 1100 pounds for my American friends

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.120
onto the property that I realised

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:41.167
perhaps would have been easier if we went 

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:42.921
with like a standard 600 by 600 tile

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:43.961
that's not really our style

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:44.641
cause apparently

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:45.842
we enjoyed making this deck 

00:00:45.843 --> 00:00:47.601
significantly harder than it needed to be

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:48.321
I mean patio

00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:49.641
we made the patio more difficult

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:50.361
just to be clear

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:53.201
but I think I saw these tiles at Tile Space like six months ago

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:54.881
and it was legitimately love at first sight

00:00:54.882 --> 00:00:55.881
they took my breath away

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:58.281
and I knew that I needed to use them somewhere in a project

00:00:58.282 --> 00:00:59.751
there's just something about them that's 

00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:00.361
giving “lived in”

00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:02.321
and that's really the ethos that I have for this house

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:03.881
I'm not sure if you've been following along with

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:05.361
any of our other renovation projects

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:07.127
but we moved from a new build into this 

00:01:07.128 --> 00:01:08.761
house about seven or eight months ago

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:10.121
and she's a 67 year old

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:11.601
mid century diamond in the rough

00:01:11.602 --> 00:01:14.001
and we're on a mission to slowly restore her to her former glory

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.401
by choosing finishes that feel like they've always been here

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:18.375
in part 1 I ran out of time to tell you exactly 

00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:19.281
why we have a deadline

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:21.121
despite the fact that I set an intention to

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.961
not rush through my projects again this year

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:24.665
and I don't know if I'm just that particular 

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:25.801
flavour of crazy that attracts

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:26.641
a hectic deadline

00:01:26.642 --> 00:01:28.121
but also I do love a deadline

00:01:28.122 --> 00:01:29.721
cause it really makes you get shit done

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:30.321
do you know what I mean

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:32.401
and consider this my behind the scenes confessional

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:33.681
because I'm not sure if you noticed

00:01:33.682 --> 00:01:35.201
but we didn't actually get the patio done

00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:37.881
but we got it done enough for me to do what I needed to do next

00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:39.321
which was the reason I had the deadline

00:01:39.322 --> 00:01:41.004
so I was approached by my friends at 

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:42.961
Freedom Furniture and the Kiwi Kids Charity

00:01:42.962 --> 00:01:44.484
and they asked me if I'd be keen to 

00:01:44.485 --> 00:01:45.881
photograph this beautiful outdoor

00:01:45.882 --> 00:01:47.878
table setting because they're auctioning off 

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:49.121
a larger version for charity

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:51.841
the Kiwi Kids Charity does really impactful work for children

00:01:51.842 --> 00:01:53.901
In Aotearoa and I love the alignment with Freedom

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.440
so it was an immediate yes from me

00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:58.081
but then I remembered what my patio look like and really

00:01:58.082 --> 00:02:00.860
I couldn't photograph such a beautiful piece of furniture

00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:01.641
 on my gross old

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:02.481
sixty year old deck

00:02:02.482 --> 00:02:03.321
I mean patio

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.081
so essentially

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:05.001
I built a set

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:05.601
and hopefully

00:02:05.602 --> 00:02:07.681
one that would honour the quality of this furniture

00:02:08.392 --> 00:02:09.872
and encourage people to go bid

00:02:09.873 --> 00:02:12.433
and raise money for children in need in our community

00:02:12.434 --> 00:02:14.353
so now if you ever see any of those photos

00:02:14.354 --> 00:02:16.233
you’ll know it's reality versus social media

00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:17.593
half of the pavers aren't stuck down

00:02:17.594 --> 00:02:18.993
we didn't even start grouting

00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:21.593
and we definitely didn't finish the project in 72 hours

00:02:21.594 --> 00:02:24.313
but we did what we needed to do before moving it all out again

00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:26.193
and continuing to stick down these pavers 

00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:27.113
which might take a week
