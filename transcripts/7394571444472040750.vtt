00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
I wasn't aware that finding joy in cooking for my husband and kids

00:03.721 --> 00:07.161
would automatically mean that I just slave away in the kitchen.

00:07.162 --> 00:08.321
I don't have a job,

00:08.322 --> 00:11.861
and I have a whole production team at my house making that happen.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.040
To clarify, none of that is true.

00:14.041 --> 00:18.341
I'm a working mom juggling all kinds of hats and responsibilities.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.540
But cooking has always been a massive part of my life,

00:21.760 --> 00:24.200
especially after I got diagnosed with Lupus

00:24.201 --> 00:26.561
and my eczema started flaring up again.

00:26.562 --> 00:29.041
I knew that I had to change the way that I ate

00:29.042 --> 00:30.861
and the way I went about life.

00:30.960 --> 00:34.280
With all that being said, today is a travel day.

00:34.281 --> 00:35.321
Little whimsy Lou

00:35.322 --> 00:38.361
and I are heading over to New York for our ninth shoot

00:38.362 --> 00:39.921
ever since she's been born.

00:39.922 --> 00:42.681
Try to wake up around six or seven every day,

00:42.682 --> 00:45.081
even though that's not always that easy.

00:45.082 --> 00:46.481
Made the kids some breakfast

00:46.482 --> 00:49.321
while they colored and rode their scooters around the house.

00:49.322 --> 00:52.361
And then it was time for Whimsy's first nap of the day,

00:52.362 --> 00:54.041
while lucky and I had some breakfast

00:54.042 --> 00:57.681
and caught up on things that we couldn't talk about the day before.

00:57.682 --> 01:00.321
I always have to put on at least a little bit of makeup

01:00.322 --> 01:03.921
to feel more alive, so I did that and threw on an outfit

01:03.922 --> 01:07.341
before getting all the kids dressed and their hair combed.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.040
This point,

01:08.041 --> 01:11.681
I realized that I only had an hour until my car was coming to pick Me

01:11.682 --> 01:14.081
up! So I raced over to the grocery store,

01:14.082 --> 01:17.241
pick lucky up some essentials for when he's home alone.

01:17.242 --> 01:20.981
Made sure to plan out the meal so he knew exactly what to make.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.160
Lucky never lets me pack my own bags,

01:23.161 --> 01:24.601
so he did that for me

01:24.602 --> 01:28.101
and we said goodbye before I was on my way to the airport.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.120
There's something about flying with a Newborn

01:30.121 --> 01:31.721
in comparison to toddlers

01:31.722 --> 01:35.101
that makes me feel like this is a mini vacation in itself.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.000
Checked our bag, went through security,

01:37.001 --> 01:39.961
and then picked up some food before boarding the plane.

01:39.962 --> 01:42.561
Right before takeoff, whimsy fell asleep,

01:42.562 --> 01:45.041
which gave me enough time to start the second book

01:45.042 --> 01:46.953
of the Crescent City series.
