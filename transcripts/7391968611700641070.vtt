00:00.040 --> 00:02.280
I've had Thai food four times last week,

00:02.281 --> 00:04.361
and here I am yet again craving it.

00:04.362 --> 00:08.481
So we're making it again. There's nothing better to me than patsu, mango,

00:08.482 --> 00:10.861
sticky rice, and some blistered green beans.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.960
I started by making my rice noodles for my patsu

00:13.961 --> 00:15.841
by combining some rice flour,

00:15.842 --> 00:17.481
tapioca starch, cold water,

00:17.482 --> 00:20.761
and a smidge of salt for oiling my little pans,

00:20.762 --> 00:24.161
spooning the batter in, and letting them steam for a couple minutes.

00:24.162 --> 00:26.401
After about a minute and a half to two minutes,

00:26.402 --> 00:28.221
I check on it, pull it,

00:28.240 --> 00:30.680
and then cut it however wide you want them.

00:30.681 --> 00:32.921
I like my rice noodles quite wide,

00:32.922 --> 00:33.921
so that's what I did.

00:33.922 --> 00:36.961
And then I repeated that process with all of my batter

00:36.962 --> 00:39.341
until I had all of my rice noodles done.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.960
That those aside, and got started on my patsu ingredients.

00:42.961 --> 00:44.881
I didn't have Chinese broccoli,

00:44.882 --> 00:47.401
so I just use some broccoli instead.

00:47.402 --> 00:50.521
I cut up my steak, sprinkled it with some cornstarch,

00:50.522 --> 00:52.081
baking soda, soy sauce,

00:52.082 --> 00:55.561
and some oil. I set that aside and worked on my Patsy.

00:55.562 --> 00:58.881
You sauce was a combination of dark and light soy,

00:58.882 --> 01:01.021
fish sauce, oyster sauce, vinegar.

01:01.040 --> 01:03.400
I fried off my steak and set that aside

01:03.401 --> 01:05.321
and got started on my green beans,

01:05.322 --> 01:08.001
which I washed and dried and then blistered.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.481
While those were frying up,

01:09.482 --> 01:12.841
I sauteed my broccoli and added some of that garlic in

01:12.842 --> 01:15.961
when I was done with it. Then it was time to add my Rice noodles,

01:15.962 --> 01:18.961
the sauce, and then I also added back in my beef

01:18.962 --> 01:21.001
and let that caramelize on the stove

01:21.002 --> 01:24.761
before cracking in an egg and scrambling that in with the noodles.

01:24.762 --> 01:26.801
Once my green beans were almost done,

01:26.802 --> 01:28.681
combine them with some sesame oil,

01:28.682 --> 01:30.561
soy sauce, the rest of the garlic.

01:30.562 --> 01:33.441
Plated those up and then plated up my patsu.

01:33.442 --> 01:35.081
We obviously needed dessert,

01:35.082 --> 01:37.681
and I had these ripe mangoes that needed to get used,

01:37.682 --> 01:39.721
so I made mango and sticky rice.

01:39.722 --> 01:42.521
If you were to ask me what my death row meal would be,

01:42.522 --> 01:44.398
this would be it. It was divine.
