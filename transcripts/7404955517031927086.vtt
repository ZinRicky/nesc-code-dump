00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.460
But I don't have time for fucking anything.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.040
Hey, Mama.

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:09.001
I wanted to pop in here and commiserate with you for a second

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:10.861
because I've got one of those, too.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.800
This is Levi. He's about seven and a half months and teething

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:16.981
and as we can see, fussy.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.600
I actually just had to put him down cause it was nap time.

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.681
But the only difference between you and me is that

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:23.981
that's my third baby.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.480
So I've Learned a little something through raising my other two.

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:28.881
And I'm gonna share that with you.

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:30.961
It's exactly as hard as you think it is.

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:33.921
Number one, you're not a bad mom for feeling the way you do.

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:36.601
Your identity will completely change

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:39.221
and is this is the growing pains of that.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.920
But also it gets a lot easier.

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:43.201
And I know people say that,

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:47.041
but every six months you have a completely different baby

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.741
with completely different needs and completely different life stage.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.380
Some of them are really shitty

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.800
and some of them are easier, probably.

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:55.681
And some days are gonna be better than others.

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:59.141
Hang in there. Get as much rest as you can. I'm with you.
