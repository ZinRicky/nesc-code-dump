00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.720
when I talk about boundaries that I've had to set with family members

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:05.000
after having children a lot of people think they're

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:08.800
like crazy things that I have requested from my family members

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:13.420
but in my opinion they are really common sense things

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.000
for example or I'll give you all a couple examples

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:20.420
um we have to leave functions for our child's bedtime

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.920
this to me

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.720
doesn't seem like a crazy thing

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:25.840
it just means that the priority is making sure our child goes down

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:29.180
at the regular bedtime because if you've had a tough sleeper

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.340
you know that bedtime is bedtime

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.040
and if someone doesn't respect that

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:36.240
or someone tries to make you feel guilty for that

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:38.160
or someone tries to push you to stay longer

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:39.480
oh they're gonna be fine

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:40.720
don't make it such a big deal

00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:41.920
you you shouldn't have to leave

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:43.520
like you're being a helicopter parent

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:46.120
that's not respectful of a

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:47.360
your priority as a parent

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:49.120
or b your boundary of like no

00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:51.320
I already told you I have to leave at this time

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:54.420
another completely reasonable example for us

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.040
was that everybody had to get vaccinated before they came to see our child

00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:59.360
and this was even pre covid

00:00:59.361 --> 00:00:59.720
so like

00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:02.100
this is 2014 for with our first

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.160
as per the pediatrician's recommendation

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:07.500
all visitors for a Newborn had to be vaccinated for flu

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.660
and had to make sure they had an updated Tdap

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.120
we got a little bit of pushback that I was not expecting

00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:16.080
and that was one of those hard boundary lines where I was like no

00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:17.700
if you are not vaccinated

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.400
you're not coming to see the baby

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:21.880
so again when I'm talking about setting boundaries with family

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.640
especially surrounding having children

00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:27.440
becoming a parent having them and their safety and well being being a priority

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:28.920
there is no wiggle room

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:33.200
but that doesn't mean that these boundaries are anything that is um

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:38.040
or should be unexpected or not easy to a abide by

00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:41.000
I know a lot of people have the take shoes off when you come in the house

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.280
because my baby's crawling around

00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:42.800
or just like

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.000
general cleanliness it's simple things like that

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.680
when you get pushed back for that

00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:50.760
you start to question the level of respect that that person has for you

00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:52.840
or what boundaries you're gonna put in place

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:55.454
or the way you're gonna navigate that relationship going forward
