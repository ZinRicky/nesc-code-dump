00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
On Monday, I did the pull up routine that Daniel always does.

00:04.641 --> 00:06.181
So sore today. Like,

00:06.480 --> 00:08.800
my back, my chest.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.901
Like, all these muscles right here.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.900
So sore. I went running today.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.280
Just the running motions. I was in pain.

00:16.281 --> 00:19.561
So I'm trying to get a lot of protein in

00:19.562 --> 00:21.621
so all that work doesn't go to waste.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.620
Two cups.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.460
So two cups of sheep's milk,

00:27.520 --> 00:32.400
vanilla bean. See the black vanilla specs in there?

00:32.401 --> 00:33.741
I'm gonna put that in,

00:37.400 --> 00:40.500
and it's so good.

00:41.320 --> 00:45.100
Out the vanilla bean, we have a creamy chocolate,

00:45.360 --> 00:49.280
and then we have the maple cinnamon.

00:49.281 --> 00:53.601
These are the three flavors that are coming again next month.

00:53.602 --> 00:56.321
They're so good. Ingredients are incredible.

00:56.322 --> 01:00.701
Colostrum grass, bedweet collagen,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.760
hemp protein. They have sea salt.

01:03.761 --> 01:06.241
This one has the maple sugar in it.

01:06.242 --> 01:10.121
Late season maple. And the cinnamon is made from cocoa powder.

01:10.122 --> 01:12.001
No artificial flavors, you guys.

01:12.002 --> 01:14.341
It's all the wrong. So yummy.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.260
Mmm.
