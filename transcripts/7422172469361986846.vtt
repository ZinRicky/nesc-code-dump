The past few years,

00:02.681 --> 00:07.941
Daniel and I have been starting off Mondays with a pull up routine.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.420
So basically, it's 90 pull UPS,

00:11.760 --> 00:13.780
but in three different grips.

00:13.960 --> 00:18.140
So we start off with the traditional wide grip pull up.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.900
We do three sets of 10 with these,

00:21.120 --> 00:24.200
and then we switch to chin UPS.

00:24.201 --> 00:26.361
So chin UPS are my favorite of the grips.

00:26.362 --> 00:27.641
They're the easiest for me.

00:27.642 --> 00:30.001
You can see Daniel helps me a little bit on the way up.

00:30.002 --> 00:32.441
Just a little bit is what I need.

00:32.442 --> 00:34.681
And then he lets go on the way down.

00:34.682 --> 00:37.841
That's perfect. And then he,

00:37.842 --> 00:40.681
of course, is adding a weighted belt.

00:40.682 --> 00:43.181
I think he has 35 pounds on right here,

00:43.400 --> 00:46.540
because he's a beast, and that's just what he does.

00:46.760 --> 00:49.160
And then usually in between sets,

00:49.161 --> 00:50.841
we're doing some sort of, like,

00:50.842 --> 00:55.041
isolated lower body. So I'm doing hip thrust.

00:55.042 --> 00:57.361
I think Daniel is doing calfs today.

00:57.362 --> 01:00.701
And then we just try to recover in between sets.

01:01.040 --> 01:04.740
So this is Daniel's last set of chin UPS.

01:04.960 --> 01:07.280
He no longer has his weighted belts on

01:07.281 --> 01:09.901
because we were getting so tired at this point.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.600
And then even his last few,

01:11.601 --> 01:16.041
he used a chair because it was getting rough.

01:16.042 --> 01:19.001
This is our neutral grip pull UPS.

01:19.002 --> 01:21.681
We did three sets of 10. This is my last set.

01:21.682 --> 01:25.021
I was dying, but I finished.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.960
Daniel threw on his weights again at the very end,

01:27.961 --> 01:30.141
just because he is so hardcore.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.880
But it was Good. It was hard.

01:33.881 --> 01:35.381
We finished strong,

01:36.120 --> 01:37.920
and now I can't move my arms.

01:37.921 --> 01:40.301
I hope you guys all have a great week.
