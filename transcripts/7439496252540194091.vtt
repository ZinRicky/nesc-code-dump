00:00.000 --> 00:00.360
Okay,

00:00.361 --> 00:02.681
here's what I think we should do to the guy who killed Blake and Riley.

00:02.682 --> 00:04.281
If you don't know, he was found guilty,

00:04.282 --> 00:07.041
and he'll probably spend the rest of his life in a tax rented prison.

00:07.042 --> 00:08.041
He'll get food, clothing,

00:08.042 --> 00:08.921
shelter, healthcare,

00:08.922 --> 00:10.841
all those things. But if we lived in a society,

00:10.842 --> 00:13.201
in a country where justice was really important,

00:13.202 --> 00:15.841
here's what we would do. Anytime someone committed a crime like this,

00:15.842 --> 00:17.361
like something really extreme,

00:17.362 --> 00:19.361
something really horrible,

00:19.362 --> 00:22.401
we would take them and put them on an island somewhere.

00:22.402 --> 00:24.241
I'm thinking somewhere just off the east coast.

00:24.242 --> 00:25.321
Doesn't have to be a big island,

00:25.322 --> 00:27.561
but it needs to be big enough to fit several of these people.

00:27.562 --> 00:29.841
And again, this island is reserved for the worst of the worst

00:29.842 --> 00:32.241
people who life in prison is too nice,

00:32.242 --> 00:34.681
but also, like capital punishment is also too nice.

00:34.682 --> 00:36.041
And you don't really know what to do with them.

00:36.042 --> 00:38.501
So you take them, you drop them off on this island.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.920
They're basically allowed to just wander around,

00:40.921 --> 00:42.601
survive, trying to find food.

00:42.602 --> 00:43.401
Maybe if you give them, like,

00:43.402 --> 00:47.121
a tent or something. And then rich people or anyone who can afford it

00:47.122 --> 00:50.981
can pay to go to this island and to do some big game hunting.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.240
It's a free for all. All the ticket sales, food,

00:54.241 --> 00:56.861
the drinks, all that money goes to the victims families.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.040
Win win, win.

00:58.041 --> 01:00.121
Really think it could be kind of a bipartisan thing,

01:00.122 --> 01:03.321
because I feel like we all agree that the prison sentences,

01:03.322 --> 01:04.241
the things that we're doing,

01:04.242 --> 01:06.301
like, it's just not satisfying.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.460
There's no justice. It's just kind of.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.200
I think my idea would actually work out really well.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.201
I maybe will type it out,

01:13.202 --> 01:15.801
maybe make a Powerpoint and email it to the DOJ.

01:15.802 --> 01:17.081
A lot of us worry about, like,

01:17.082 --> 01:18.401
where our next meals are gonna come from

01:18.402 --> 01:19.881
or paying for healthcare and stuff.

01:19.882 --> 01:21.241
This guy doesn't even have to worry about.

01:21.242 --> 01:23.161
He'll never have to worry about for the rest of his life.

01:23.162 --> 01:24.841
It's just so messed up. I'm sorry.

01:24.842 --> 01:26.121
Anyway, that's my idea, though.

01:26.122 --> 01:27.017
Let me know what you think.
