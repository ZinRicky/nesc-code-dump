00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.640
My husband's palette for authentic Mexican

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:05.201
food is on the level of my quest for 24 seven

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:05.881
nutrient dense

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:06.521
real foods.

00:00:06.522 --> 00:00:09.921
And I'm okay with that because it makes me better in the kitchen.

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:12.201
Tonight I'm making him caldo do this.

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:15.041
A beef and vegetable soup with a rich meat broth.

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:19.121
I start by searing chunks of 100% grass fed beef on all sides.

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:20.641
I made sure to include bones

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:23.641
because they contain so many minerals and nutrients collagen,

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:24.401
connective tissue,

00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:25.481
protein, and bone marrow.

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:27.881
After adding several batches of meat and bones

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:29.361
to a stock pot of boiling water,

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.281
I deglaze the pan along with onion,

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:34.641
garlic, and broth and add all that good flavor back into the stock pot.

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:36.361
I let that simmer for a few hours

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:38.201
until the meat was falling off the bone,

00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:39.641
then added chopped carrot,

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:42.761
potato, and large chunks of cabbage to the pot until just cooked.

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:45.441
And lastly organic corn which took no time.

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:47.841
While the caldo de RES finished cooking,

00:00:47.842 --> 00:00:49.961
I prepared some tortillas the fast way

00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:52.321
using dried masa with a bit of hot water.

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:52.881
A tortilla

00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:56.281
press is a great tool to have when pumping out homemade tortillas

00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:59.281
and they only take a few minutes to fully cook in a hot coma.

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:02.841
I keep them warm and soft until dinner by storing them in a tortillero

00:01:02.842 --> 00:01:05.081
while my family sits for dinner at the dining table.

00:01:05.082 --> 00:01:07.481
I plate each bowl by carefully adding beef chunks,

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:09.081
each vegetable, a cabbage chunk,

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:10.721
And garnishing with pickled radish,

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:13.961
probiotic crowd and dried cilantro flowers from last year's garden.

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:16.743
This meal was nutrient dense and satisfied us all.
