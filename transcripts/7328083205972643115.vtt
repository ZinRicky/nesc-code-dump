You're going to the Riviera Maya.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.560
You have to stop by Ishkaret Ecopark.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.880
We went with our three kids

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.120
and there were so much to do.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.360
We spent the entire day there exploring everywhere.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.920
We walked through my iron ruins and ecological exhibits.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.480
We Learned so much about ancient mind,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.640
culture and history

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.520
and got to explore

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.580
the beautiful landscape of the sonotes and jungle.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.760
The kids water park area was a huge hit

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.800
with ropes courses and swimming holes.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.240
We Learned tons about local coral reef ecology.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.040
At the aquarium

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.320
we had the best buffet lunch

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.880
with traditional Mexican staples

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.320
and peruse some Mayan crafts.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.740
This is definitely a must do if you're in the Yucatan.
