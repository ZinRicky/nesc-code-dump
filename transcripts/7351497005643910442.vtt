Toddlers requested some yogurt this morning and we were running low,

00:03.321 --> 00:05.641
so I just decided to make it myself.

00:05.642 --> 00:07.801
They always have to have granola with their yogurt,

00:07.802 --> 00:10.121
so I made that first by adding some oats,

00:10.122 --> 00:11.701
cinnamon, maple syrup,

00:11.840 --> 00:13.040
a smidge of peanut butter,

00:13.041 --> 00:14.281
some coconut oil,

00:14.282 --> 00:15.401
some coconut flakes.

00:15.402 --> 00:17.201
I gave that really good mix

00:17.202 --> 00:20.441
and also decided to add some peanuts in there as well.

00:20.442 --> 00:22.441
I transferred that over to my baking sheet,

00:22.442 --> 00:23.321
pressed it down,

00:23.322 --> 00:25.021
and then pop that in the oven.

00:25.280 --> 00:26.000
In the meantime,

00:26.001 --> 00:29.641
I poured some milk into my pot and heated that up on the stove.

00:29.642 --> 00:31.601
Once that barely reached a simmer,

00:31.602 --> 00:33.361
I let that cool off,

00:33.362 --> 00:34.441
pulled out my granola,

00:34.442 --> 00:35.841
sprinkled it with some cherries,

00:35.842 --> 00:38.241
cranberries, and some more coconut flakes.

00:38.242 --> 00:39.481
When my milk was lukewarm,

00:39.482 --> 00:43.481
I combined some of the leftover yogurt I have with the warm milk

00:43.482 --> 00:45.361
before pouring it back into my milk,

00:45.362 --> 00:47.001
covering that with a towel,

00:47.002 --> 00:49.801
and letting it rest in a warm place for a few hours.

00:49.802 --> 00:52.801
By this time, my granola had cold enough for me to break it up

00:52.802 --> 00:55.341
and put it away in a glass jar.

00:55.560 --> 00:58.040
Depending on the consistency you want your yogurt to be,

00:58.041 --> 01:01.081
you can let it sit for about six hours or overnight

01:01.082 --> 01:03.841
before popping it in the fridge for another few hours.

01:03.842 --> 01:05.681
Once I pulled my pot out of the fridge,

01:05.682 --> 01:08.641
I gave the yogurt a good mix and it was ready to serve.

01:08.642 --> 01:11.561
Put some yogurt in The bowls topped it with the granola,

01:11.562 --> 01:14.841
added some raspberries and obviously a drizzle of honey.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.761
I popped any leftovers in the fridge

01:16.762 --> 01:18.322
and they were so excited to have that.
