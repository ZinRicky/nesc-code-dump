00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.600
if you think I look like a mess

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:02.764
you should see my house 

00:00:02.765 --> 00:00:03.880
I've had a busy morning

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:05.517
I started the day with a yoga class 

00:00:05.518 --> 00:00:06.200
and I came home

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:07.776
scooped up the kids and we went and ran 

00:00:07.777 --> 00:00:08.880
some errands for a few hours

00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.214
on our travels we picked up some groceries 

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:11.540
as you do

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.360
and unfortunately

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:14.286
my fridge is at that point where you can't 

00:00:14.287 --> 00:00:15.720
actually put new groceries in it

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:16.840
without sorting it out

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:18.755
normally I like to stay across the day to day 

00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:19.880
jobs a bit better than this

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.880
but when we're going hammer and tongs on a project

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:24.120
I find it extremely difficult to juggle everything

00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:25.640
and I'm aware that realistically

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.360
if I was working side by side with Mark in the pool right now

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.960
we would be making faster progress

00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:31.880
but I also need what I call my mummy days

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:34.160
I really need that one on one time with the kids

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:36.247
and I also need time to kinda organise the house 

00:00:36.248 --> 00:00:37.440
and get ready for the week ahead

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:39.295
so I'm chopping up some fruit for the fridge 

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:40.120
because if I do this

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:40.960
it'll get eaten

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:41.800
 and if I don't

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:42.174
it won't 

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.840
I've also got two out of three kids sitting at the bench with me

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:46.577
and chopping up fruit in front of kids as such 

00:00:46.578 --> 00:00:47.760
a sneaky way to make them eat it

00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:49.461
I think a big part of motherhood is 

00:00:49.462 --> 00:00:51.400
conquering the out of subtle manipulation

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:53.280
because I've just popped a little bowl in front

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:55.200
of them and the fruits there and wouldn't you know it

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.573
they're just helping themselves 

00:00:56.574 --> 00:00:56.960
side note

00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:58.563
but I found chopping that watermelon 

00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:00.080
extremely fkn satisfying anyway

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:01.789
another good thing about making up these 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.040
fruit containers is at the end

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:05.160
I'll just chop up some of the fruit a little bit smaller

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:06.720
and then throw together a fruit salad

00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.400
these don't last five minutes in my house

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.160
they're so yummy and we all love them

00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:11.680
it's time to put everything back in the fridge

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:13.040
and I'm just gonna give you a warning now

00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.160
my fridge is not a content fridge okay

00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:18.040
my items stay in the packaging that I purchased them in and yeah

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:20.800
I kinda wish that I decanted them into beautiful aesthetic jars

00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:24.480
but also I'm renovating I have 3 kids and I am at capacity okay

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:27.019
but it's a normal functional family fridge and we love her 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.880
fingerprints and all

00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:29.520
alright we're on the home stretch now

00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:31.360
I put away the rest of the groceries into the cupboard

00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:32.978
unloaded the bottom dish drawer and then 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.440
got started on the dishes in the sink

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:36.560
then it was time to give everything a really good wipe down

00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:37.464
can't forget the tap 

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:38.240
and I love the tap

00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:40.440
but the only downside of a tap with a motion sensor

00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:41.600
is that it's easier to turn on

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.210
than my husband

00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:43.880
 I gave the sink a really good scrub down

00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:45.960
and this I think is one of my favourite jobs

00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:47.640
I don't know how long you've been following me for

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.160
but if you remember my old house

00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:51.040
you will know the lore about the white sink

00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:52.538
and saying goodbye to that sink was 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.120
probably the saddest part about moving

00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:57.280
it took us a full year but I finally put a white sink into this place 

00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:58.120
and you might have noticed that

00:01:58.121 --> 00:02:00.520
I haven't actually updated you on the kitchen renovation

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:01.240
in a hot minute

00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:04.360
I was waiting for a few finishing touches to arrive and they finally did

00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:06.760
so I'll be posting that series in the next few days

00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:08.280
hopefully I say that but honestly

00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:09.680
don't be surprised if is it’s delayed 

00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:11.459
because I just feel like I'm tryna do too many 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.520
things at once at the moment

00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:14.560
and lowkey failing at all of them anyway

00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:17.400
I use the sleepy moppy thingy on the floor before vacuuming the rug

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:18.640
and lighting a fk off candle

00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:19.600
and if you don't know what that is

00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:21.600
you just light a candle in an area that you've cleaned

00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:23.480
and it will tell everyone in your house to fk off

00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:24.520
mine smells like gingerbread

00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:26.520
There’s no better feeling for me than a clean space

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.560
but then I remembered that now I have to make dinner

00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:30.078
and it was basically pointless
