00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.720
Thank you so much.

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:06.641
Thank you so fucking much for bringing up Shakira and her fucking ex,

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:11.061
because. And then. What a fucking fool.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.260
Just. Okay.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.360
Oh, my god.

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.421
I could do a whole fucking series on the women.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.480
Like the woman who dated Shakira's ex

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:26.641
and willingly got in the passenger seat.

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:28.841
What was the fucking car joke she makes?

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:32.241
She says in the thing I gotta fucking hold on in her song.

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:35.041
She says, you exchanged a Ferrari for a twinkle,

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:36.121
meaning a really expensive,

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:37.441
nice car for a really shitty,

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:38.821
little stupid fucking car.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.100
And you change your Rolex for Casio.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.320
What I can't understand is the fucking woman

00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:47.721
who's willing to ride in that car

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:50.121
fucking with him and be like, yeah,

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:54.341
that's right, we're downgrades, and we love that.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.320
Like, how do you not see that you're just a tool?

00:00:59.321 --> 00:00:59.961
How do you not see that

00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:02.601
you're just being used as some fucking arm candy

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:03.881
to try to make her jealous?

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:06.321
But what are you really telling us with those fucking actions?

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:11.001
What you're telling us is you fucking bumped that song so hard,

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:15.301
you memorized the lyrics, understood all the references.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.440
You're clearly not over her.

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:21.321
You're so fucking bent about her,

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:25.061
you're making yourself look like a fool just to try to stay relevant,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.220
just to try to get yourself noticed by her somehow. It's like you,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.280
the
