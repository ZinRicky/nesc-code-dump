My toddlers have been asking for marshmallows

00:02.400 --> 00:03.520
ever since we ran out,

00:03.520 --> 00:06.280
so today I decided to surprise them by

00:06.280 --> 00:08.860
making them some salted caramel marshmallows.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.840
I started by making the caramel syrup

00:10.840 --> 00:13.120
by melting down some sugar with some butter

00:13.120 --> 00:15.860
and then slowly adding in some heavy cream.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.560
I let it boil for a couple minutes

00:17.560 --> 00:19.680
and then add some flaky sea salt in

00:19.680 --> 00:22.560
before transferring it over to a glass container

00:22.560 --> 00:23.900
so that it can cool.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.000
Then I move on to making my marshmallows

00:26.000 --> 00:27.960
by combining some water and gelatin

00:27.960 --> 00:29.200
and letting that bloom.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.760
I wanted to keep these sugar free,

00:30.760 --> 00:33.120
so I used honey instead.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.120
Once my honey mixture was hot enough,

00:35.120 --> 00:36.880
I poured it in with the gelatin

00:36.880 --> 00:39.220
and whipped it until it was light and fluffy.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.000
In the meantime,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.400
I dusted my baking dish with some aroot powder

00:43.400 --> 00:46.260
and then spooned the marshmallow fluff into it.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.760
This was all very sticky,

00:47.760 --> 00:50.800
so I made sure my hands were damp before I went in

00:50.800 --> 00:52.180
to smooth it all out.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.200
My caramel sauce had cooled enough,

00:54.200 --> 00:57.280
so I put dollops on it on top of my marshmallow fluff

00:57.280 --> 00:58.780
and then swirled it in.

00:58.840 --> 01:00.960
Sprinkled some flaky sea salt on top

01:00.960 --> 01:02.880
and also some more aero root powder

01:02.880 --> 01:04.260
so it wouldn't stick.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.400
Let that sit for about five hours

01:06.400 --> 01:08.360
and then it was ready to get sliced.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.040
I went with bigger squares

01:10.040 --> 01:12.900
and the caramel on top was so perfect!
