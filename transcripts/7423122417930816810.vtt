00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.080
Two members of the cast of Little House in the Prairie

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:03.601
was in Tulsa this weekend,

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:05.921
and we just had the best time.

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.881
I've been working for Dean Butler for a little over a year.

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:10.641
I am his social media director,

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:13.161
and then I just help coordinate things as needed.

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:16.761
I live in Tulsa, so having Dean and Jennifer Ginotti,

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:20.641
who played Baby Rose, come to Tulsa this weekend was so much fun.

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:22.281
Aside from the events that we had scheduled,

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:24.881
we also did some fun things like baking cookies,

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:25.881
painting pumpkins,

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:28.961
and doing some press for the events that were on the schedule.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.241
This was a new experience for me,

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:32.681
cause I'd never been in a new studio before.

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:36.081
Being part of Little House has really opened so many doors for me

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:39.281
and so many new experiences that I didn't even know were possible.

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:40.801
It's really incredible to see,

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:41.681
50 years later,

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:44.841
how much people are still so obsessed with Little House on the Prairie

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:46.521
and really care about this legacy.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:48.601
The Little House cast is truly like family,

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:51.241
and it is so special to have a small part in it all.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:54.281
While there's not any other events for the entire cast on the schedule

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:58.081
this year, Dean does have a lot of book signings coming up,

00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:00.081
and there's a lot to look forward in 2025.

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:01.859
Little House is just getting started.
