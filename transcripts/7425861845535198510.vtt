00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.920
So as women, we know we live in a different reality than men do, right?

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:05.721
But this manifested the other day in such an interesting way.

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:07.321
So I was driving with my husband,

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:10.481
and we are parking at this big box store with a big parking lot,

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:12.121
and he likes to park super far away,

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:13.761
as far away from anyone else as possible,

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:15.781
as far away from the front door as possible.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.360
And I was huffing and puffing.

00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:18.001
I'm like, ugh,

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.481
you always do this? You always park so far away.

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:21.761
And he's like, yeah.

00:00:21.762 --> 00:00:23.241
He's like, I don't want the car to get messed up.

00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:25.601
He goes, but you always park so close to other people.

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:27.601
Why do you do that? And I was like,

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:29.761
oh my god. He doesn't know.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:30.201
He was like,

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:32.961
is it because you have short little legs and you don't wanna walk?

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:34.081
And I'm like, no,

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:35.701
it's so I don't get kidnapped.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.320
And he thought I was crazy.

00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:38.761
He thinks it's just me. And I was like, no.

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:40.961
A lot of women do this. Will park either close to the front,

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:43.441
close to the cart return, or under a light.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:44.941
I'm like, for visibility.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.520
Cause although your priority is the car not getting dinged,

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:50.261
mine is not getting kidnapped.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.780
And I feel like those are different levels of concern.
