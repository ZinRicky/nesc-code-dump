00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.620
No.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.900
Jacob. What? Can you come here?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.380
Is that a line?

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.080
Even if it's a faint line,

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:41.541
is that. Is that a faint line, Jacob?

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.760
Peter, I think there's, like,

00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:48.141
a shadow. I think.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.380
I think that something's on there. That is a paint line.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.180
Well, we're gonna have to take five or six more,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.040
see what happens. No,

00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.201
it's not. It's not.

00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:01.721
It's not real. No,

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:03.481
it's not. I'm not pregnant, Jacob.

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:04.461
There's no way.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.620
I need to get some dimmer lights in here.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.100
Jacob. What?

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.840
Jacob, I might be pregnant.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:19.381
It's possible. Do you think that's why Daisy's been acting weird?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.120
It's possible, babe.

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.401
That means we'd have a baby next July.

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:24.601
And I just said that we were gonna.

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:25.801
Right? According to plan.

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:28.761
And I've been telling everybody that we were gonna wait another year,

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:30.561
and I'm. No,

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:32.241
I'm not. I'm in denial.

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:35.001
I don't think it's real. I'm down to be in denial for a little bit.

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:36.081
Okay. But, hey,

00:01:36.082 --> 00:01:37.361
I love you no matter what.

00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:39.481
And I think if it does happen,

00:01:39.482 --> 00:01:43.761
it's God's will, and it's gonna be super awesome. Okay.

00:01:43.762 --> 00:01:45.981
Do you think that it's actually positive?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.180
No. You don't think it's actually positive?

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.920
Well, okay,

00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:51.981
so you're this close to your period.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.380
Um, with our current activities in consideration,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.040
uh, I don't see how it could be that faint of a line if you're truly

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.361
are pregnant. Does that make sense?

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:06.281
But they say. Even if it's like. Yeah,

00:02:06.282 --> 00:02:07.401
whatever they say, Like,

00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:10.181
I'm sure there's a point zero zero one %.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.440
You know, like,

00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:13.121
you are pregnant if you have this faint of line.

00:02:13.122 --> 00:02:15.801
But I am trying to argue that if you truly are pregnant,

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.501
you would truly be pregnant.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.880
Therefore, you truly would have the hormonal markers for that.

00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:23.601
And that does not. But the line is there.

00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:25.541
And all the other ones we've ever taken,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.100
the line hasn't been there at all. Mm hmm.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.460
You see the line?

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.860
Dude, I was just joking.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.760
I just thought I was gonna take a pregnancy test

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.001
because I've been feeling, like,

00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:45.601
so funny. But I thought it was my period.

00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:46.881
My lungs have been so big.

00:02:46.882 --> 00:02:48.041
I don't think I'm pregnant.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:49.581
I don't think you are, either.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.280
Should I take another test?

00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:57.801
Yeah, I think you should take it.

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:00.701
Or wait till tomorrow would probably be the best use of spin.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.380
You know, I don't know how much these things cost, but.
