00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.440
this is not a euphemism

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:03.345
but I asked my husband to pop to the shops 

00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:04.720
and bring me home a lot of soil

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:05.840
and a little bit of corn

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:07.000
but of course he brought home

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:08.560
 a little bit of soil and a lot of corn

00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:10.041
and I'm really hoping it's just cause he 

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:10.800
can't listen for shit

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.693
and not because it's indicative of a greater 

00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:14.040
issue that I need to be aware of

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:14.960
anyway once again

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:16.280
I've been distracted by my garden

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:16.920
cause I find that

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:18.851
the results of gardening lasts a lot longer 

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.080
than the results of cleaning

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:21.680
not that I don't need to do that as well

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:22.840
 I need to do a lot of things

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:25.360
this poor renovation has been seriously kicking my ass

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:27.204
but a week or so ago I found a bunch of 

00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:28.680
plants at the school fair for $2

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.155
and even though I don't really have any 

00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:31.040
room for any more plants

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:34.360
if you're selling them for $2 I will buy as many as I can carry

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:35.564
and normally I would just 

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:36.120
shall we say

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:37.476
bribe my husband to build 

00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:38.520
me a new planter box

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.160
but I seriously think that that poor man might be at capacity

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:42.838
considering I've just convinced him to 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.000
renovate a 50 year old pool

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.080
with no pool renovation experience

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:47.825
so I'm on my own with this one and 

00:00:47.826 --> 00:00:49.720
with limited soil resources apparently

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:52.120
but I have an unused space behind my plant boxes

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:53.720
and I thought maybe I could utilise it

00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:56.400
I added three cucumbers to the existing planter box

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:58.320
and back here I'm gonna add two pumpkins

00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:00.734
three very sick looking sunflowers and

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:02.640
 like 24 corns for some reason

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.240
anyway at this point I have no idea if they're gonna take

00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:07.128
I might have to go in with some more soil and 

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:08.360
kinda build it up a little bit

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:10.166
but they were seriously gonna die if I left 

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:11.480
them in their containers any more

00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:12.680
so I did my best alright?

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.240
my little garden makes me so happy

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:17.240
I come out here multiple times a day and just enjoy checking on it

00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:18.240
and I need you to tell me that

00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:20.480
I'm not the only one that likes talking to her plants

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:22.302
cause I swear it makes them grow more okay
