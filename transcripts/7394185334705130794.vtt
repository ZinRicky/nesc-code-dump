00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.840
Ladies, college campuses are no longer a place to go and find a husband.

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:06.721
And you can thank feminism for that.

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:08.521
Let me explain. On the bright side,

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:11.921
we have a lot of women that are now getting their college education.

00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:17.021
But statistics are showing that women greatly outnumber men in college.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.800
Affirmative action and all that BS.

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:20.921
But when you put yourself in an environment

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:23.341
where you are not a rare commodity any longer,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.760
meaning the ratio is one man to every 10 women.

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:29.321
The men can go around and have whoever they want.

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:31.441
They can act a fool and do whatever they want

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:34.561
because they are pretty much guaranteed sex.

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:36.221
Especially with our modern day culture.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.040
So you're looking for a relationship.

00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:42.041
I would absolutely advise to not try to find one at college.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.081
And the second point to this is

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:45.001
I personally

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:48.601
do not think that women should be dating men of their same age.

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:51.521
Don't make lateral moves. You want to date up.

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:53.361
I was engaged at the age of 20

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:54.601
and what was I thinking

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:58.041
when that man's brain was not fully developed till we were 24?

00:00:58.042 --> 00:00:59.561
If you want a serious relationship,

00:00:59.562 --> 00:01:00.681
you wanna get married young,

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:01.921
you wanna start kids young,

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:02.441
or at least

00:01:02.442 --> 00:01:06.101
find a man while you're at your peak fertility and attractiveness.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.240
Then you wanna be putting yourself in environments

00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:10.441
where you have successful men

00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:13.561
that are older than you. And you're not gonna find that at a frat party.

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:17.481
Honey, this right here is why less and less women are finding husbands,

00:01:17.482 --> 00:01:20.801
especially in college. Then they get their career,

00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:23.221
then they work their way up through boss babe culture.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.800
Then all of a sudden, you're 35

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:28.271
and wondering why all these men are going after young 24 year olds.
