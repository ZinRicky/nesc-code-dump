00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.740
There's more to life than being pretty.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.220
There is more to you

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.320
than how attractive you are to the rest of the world.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.860
Your sole focus in life should not be

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.240
to be more consumable,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.480
to be more digestible to people.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.240
You are a full human being

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.120
and just because you don't fit some narrow,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.320
narrow minded belief of what is and isn't beautiful

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.600
does not make you worth any less,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.560
does not make you have any less value.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.240
You are perfect in the body that you have.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.280
You are perfect in the way that you look.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.400
And the only person,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.160
the only opinion

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.640
that matters on your body and your appearance

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.780
is your own.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.920
You deserve to be happy exactly as you are

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.619
because you are perfect exactly as you are.
