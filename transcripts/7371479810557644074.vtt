00:00.040 --> 00:01.160
I can't help but wonder,

00:01.161 --> 00:04.321
had Harrison Butker taken a moment to shout out women

00:04.322 --> 00:06.521
for their amazing careers they were about to have,

00:06.522 --> 00:08.281
or for the volunteer work they would do,

00:08.282 --> 00:10.441
or for the businesses they were going to open,

00:10.442 --> 00:12.961
he wouldn't be facing the backlash he's facing right now.

00:12.962 --> 00:15.121
He said, I know my wife would say

00:15.122 --> 00:18.841
her life really began the day she opened her business,

00:18.842 --> 00:21.721
or the day she started helping her patients as a doctor,

00:21.722 --> 00:23.781
or the day she started writing her book.

00:23.800 --> 00:24.920
Nobody would be mad at him.

00:24.921 --> 00:27.521
We probably wouldn't have heard any controversy about the speech,

00:27.522 --> 00:28.801
or we would be supporting it.

00:28.802 --> 00:31.441
And that is because we see the value in those.

00:31.442 --> 00:34.361
We know that those things contribute to our society,

00:34.362 --> 00:37.481
to our world. But when it comes to things like stay at home mothers,

00:37.482 --> 00:39.081
homemakers, housewives,

00:39.082 --> 00:42.221
those things you have been conditioned to think are not valuable.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.800
Why, you never hear anybody say,

00:43.801 --> 00:46.281
you can be so much more than just a lawyer.

00:46.282 --> 00:48.961
You can be so much more than just a senior vice president.

00:48.962 --> 00:51.961
But as women, we hear that all the time about being wives and mothers.

00:51.962 --> 00:52.801
So many people,

00:52.802 --> 00:53.561
women especially,

00:53.562 --> 00:56.321
have been conditioned to see the role of mother,

00:56.322 --> 00:59.141
of homemaker, of housewife as degrading.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.440
So they put it down here.

01:00.441 --> 01:02.521
So when someone comes along and says, women,

01:02.522 --> 01:04.401
this is the greatest thing you can do,

01:04.402 --> 01:05.601
they look down here and go,

01:05.602 --> 01:08.881
you mean way down There, homemaker, mom.

01:08.882 --> 01:11.881
And they're offended and they lose their minds, because, how dare he?

01:11.882 --> 01:12.681
But for a lot of us,

01:12.682 --> 01:14.161
we see that role up here,

01:14.162 --> 01:14.881
so we aren't offended.

01:14.882 --> 01:16.001
When somebody recognizes that,

01:16.002 --> 01:19.361
that's great. It just seems to go very unnoticed by our culture.

01:19.362 --> 01:22.401
And when we finally have someone who has a big voice

01:22.402 --> 01:24.061
and who has a big platform

01:24.160 --> 01:26.160
recognize that and recognize that work,

01:26.161 --> 01:27.081
we cancel him.

01:27.082 --> 01:28.001
People, women,

01:28.002 --> 01:29.881
usually women who are supposed to be on our side,

01:29.882 --> 01:30.881
they say, no,

01:30.882 --> 01:32.521
you are not to praise those women.

01:32.522 --> 01:35.761
Sure, you can celebrate women for any other thing in the world,

01:35.762 --> 01:36.787
but not that.
