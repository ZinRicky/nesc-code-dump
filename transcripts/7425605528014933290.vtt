00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.380
I thought I was so organized and planned so well for today

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.280
but I failed my son has speech therapy at 10:00am on Mondays

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:10.720
so I thought okay

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:13.800
if I do an 8:00am doctor's appointment

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:15.340
I would get that out of the way

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.520
and then speech therapy

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:20.320
and then we can start our homeschool and have a normal week

00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:22.340
like start our week off really well

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.960
my children are on vacation

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:27.460
so therefore there is no speech therapy

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.100
I could have slept in

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.500
but instead I booked a freaking 8:00am on a Monday morning appointment

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.700
who does that
