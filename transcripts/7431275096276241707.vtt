00:00.000 --> 00:02.820
Reasons why you might not be happy in your relationship.

00:02.920 --> 00:06.080
Number one, you stop doing the little things for each other.

00:06.081 --> 00:08.781
Those things that you did in the beginning of the relationship

00:09.080 --> 00:12.240
that made you create that spark within each other stopped.

00:12.241 --> 00:13.881
Stop treating your partner special.

00:13.882 --> 00:15.341
The spark dies down.

00:15.440 --> 00:19.200
You stop thanking each other for all the little things that they do

00:19.201 --> 00:21.101
to make your life more bearable.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.400
The second you do that,

00:22.401 --> 00:24.401
it's not really worth their time to continue doing that.

00:24.402 --> 00:25.921
So do not forget to thank them

00:25.922 --> 00:28.241
and appreciate them for being in your life.

00:28.242 --> 00:29.941
3. You got comfortable.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.900
This is normal when you're in a long term relationship

00:32.960 --> 00:35.020
to fall in a comfortable pattern.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.840
Stop trying so hard. They stop pouring into your relationship.

00:37.841 --> 00:38.961
You stop planning the dates,

00:38.962 --> 00:41.041
you stop setting the flirty tech up,

00:41.042 --> 00:42.081
getting cute for each other,

00:42.082 --> 00:43.241
and you stop being playful.

00:43.242 --> 00:45.561
Why can't you fall into this comfort mode

00:45.562 --> 00:47.681
that I don't have to put too much energy in?

00:47.682 --> 00:50.761
My relationship mode is the second your relationship suffers.

00:50.762 --> 00:52.401
Stop looking forward to seeing each other,

00:52.402 --> 00:55.801
you start arguing more, and maybe worse of all,

00:55.802 --> 00:58.921
your intimacy, physically and emotionally suffers.

00:58.922 --> 01:01.341
If you don't want a failing relationship,

01:01.800 --> 01:04.315
do not forget to put in the effort.
