00:00.040 --> 00:01.480
I don't want anything for Christmas.

00:01.481 --> 00:04.761
I think we ruin Christmas for ourselves

00:04.762 --> 00:08.321
by putting pressure on ourselves to buy gifts for every single adult

00:08.322 --> 00:09.681
we know. Your work friends,

00:09.682 --> 00:11.401
your boss, your mother in law,

00:11.402 --> 00:12.881
father in law, brother in law,

00:12.882 --> 00:14.321
sister in law, your brothers,

00:14.322 --> 00:16.541
your sisters, their spouses,

00:16.680 --> 00:17.780
kids, teachers,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.600
your friends, their spouses.

00:19.601 --> 00:20.841
Why do we do this to ourselves?

00:20.842 --> 00:21.841
Why do we do this to ourselves?

00:21.842 --> 00:23.081
Especially in this economy?

00:23.082 --> 00:23.521
Yeah, like,

00:23.522 --> 00:24.721
my husband will get me something.

00:24.722 --> 00:26.041
That's great. My kids,

00:26.042 --> 00:26.761
I hope they, like,

00:26.762 --> 00:28.201
draw me a picture or something.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.541
But everybody else, like, just.

00:30.720 --> 00:31.880
Just come hang out with me.

00:31.881 --> 00:33.601
Let's go out to dinner. Let's get, like,

00:33.602 --> 00:36.281
chips and salsa and chat and have a game night.

00:36.282 --> 00:37.121
Bring me, like,

00:37.122 --> 00:38.801
a soda and we can hang out together.

00:38.802 --> 00:41.201
That's all I want. I just want food and hanging out.

00:41.202 --> 00:42.201
That's all I want from friends.

00:42.202 --> 00:43.821
That's all I want from family members.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.700
I think if we're all being honest,

00:45.920 --> 00:47.120
that's what we all want to.

00:47.121 --> 00:49.641
The real fun of Christmas is the children.

00:49.642 --> 00:52.081
It's getting gifts for kids and watching them get excited.

00:52.082 --> 00:53.401
That's what it's about.

00:53.402 --> 00:55.361
Reason that people really get stressed out around the holidays

00:55.362 --> 00:56.721
isn't really because of, like,

00:56.722 --> 00:59.121
the little kids toys. It's because of these adult gifts

00:59.122 --> 01:01.321
that we feel like we have to get somebody.

01:01.322 --> 01:04.290
So it's just a PSA that if you don't give me a gift, that's okay.
