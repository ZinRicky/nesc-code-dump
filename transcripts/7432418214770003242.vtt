00:00.080 --> 00:02.080
My natural hair is very curly

00:02.081 --> 00:04.721
when I started straightening it almost two years ago.

00:04.722 --> 00:07.601
I've always tried to keep it as healthy as possible.

00:07.602 --> 00:09.281
And one thing I used from the beginning

00:09.282 --> 00:13.081
is the K18 leave in Molecular Repair Hair Mask.

00:13.082 --> 00:15.521
I use about a pump, work it through my hair,

00:15.522 --> 00:17.081
let it sit, brush it out,

00:17.082 --> 00:19.201
and then go straight into blow drying it.

00:19.202 --> 00:22.121
I swear by this mask. It reverses heat damage,

00:22.122 --> 00:24.941
color damage, leaves your hair good as new.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.560
I'm always so surprised at how healthy my curls are

00:27.561 --> 00:30.521
after straightening my hair for the past two years.

00:30.522 --> 00:34.181
Finish it off with the K18 oil, and there we go.
