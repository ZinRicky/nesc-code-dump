00:00.080 --> 00:00.840
A couple years ago,

00:00.840 --> 00:03.060
I was in college pursuing meteorology.

00:03.320 --> 00:04.860
That was considered great.

00:05.160 --> 00:06.160
A couple years ago,

00:06.160 --> 00:08.580
I was into the bodybuilding industry,

00:08.640 --> 00:10.200
and I was into fitness modeling.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.460
That was awesome.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.860
However, when I decide I want to drop out of college

00:14.960 --> 00:16.700
and become a traditional wife,

00:16.920 --> 00:18.400
and my only goal in life

00:18.400 --> 00:20.500
is to be an amazing wife and mother,

00:20.760 --> 00:22.980
that's when eyebrows seem to raise.

00:23.000 --> 00:23.880
When I was younger,

00:23.880 --> 00:26.420
I grew up in a traditional Indian community,

00:26.680 --> 00:29.180
and a lot of these families were from India,

00:29.320 --> 00:30.960
and they moved into this community

00:30.960 --> 00:32.260
to live with each other.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.240
And there were both housewives

00:34.240 --> 00:36.860
and career women in these families.

00:36.960 --> 00:40.680
And they always said how accepted and appreciated

00:40.680 --> 00:43.780
both housewives and career women are in India.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.920
I've also nanny for quite a few Indian families,

00:46.920 --> 00:48.840
and they've all said the same thing.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.240
So what is it about the west

00:50.240 --> 00:52.762
that wants to devalue traditional wives?
