00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.160
much like the rest of them

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:02.450
today is gonna be a sprint 

00:00:02.451 --> 00:00:03.120
and a marathon

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:04.320
I've just got the kids to school

00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.054
and I've got about 15 minutes before I need 

00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:07.040
to be out the door myself

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:09.040
because I'm currently running late for athletics day

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.776
and I'm well aware of the fact that the day 

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:11.960
here is about to be ridiculous

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:12.968
so I'm gonna put the 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.408
Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Lift & Firm Cream makeup 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:16.440
to the ultimate test

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:17.680
it's perfect for these busy days

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:19.762
because there’s actually anti-ageing technology

00:00:19.763 --> 00:00:20.560
 within the makeup

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:22.710
and it gives a lovely medium to full coverage 

00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:24.160
while still feeling lightweight

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:25.920
like it feels like I'm just wearing moisturiser

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.829
and lately in an attempt to not look so 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.880
exhausted all the time

00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:30.752
I've been loving popping a swipe of glitter 

00:00:30.753 --> 00:00:32.200
over the eyelid from my daily look

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.600
soft and neutral but definitely adds a little something

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.416
I'm using one of Elizabeth Arden’s new 

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:38.280
eyeshadow quads in shade Profoundly Pink

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.240
also have Oh So Neutral and Desert Nudes

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:41.640
they're really nicely pigmented

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.080
and they're definitely gonna be my go to for event season

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:45.360
okay we had time for makeup

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:46.192
definitely not hair

00:00:46.193 --> 00:00:48.120
 cause I was meant to be there 3 minutes ago

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.480
and my inner child really hates it whenever I'm late

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:52.520
I cheered my girl on, popped past the bakery

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.120
split lunch with my husband in the pool

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.420
and quietly try not to freak out about all of the things that I need to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.393
then I got distracted by my garden and did 

00:00:59.394 --> 00:01:01.040
some admin before picking the kids up

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:03.200
even though I was running around hot and sweaty all day

00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:04.720
I feel like the makeup really held up

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.840
there was minimal separation and no creasing

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:08.000
and that's with no touch ups 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:08.475
by the way 

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:09.600
and then finally I'm back 

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:10.206
where I belong
