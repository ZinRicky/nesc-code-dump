00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.980
What? Nothing wrong with me.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.200
3 nothing wrong with me.

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:08.041
You do know that none of those are controversial ways to raise boys,

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:09.601
right? I have two sons,

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:10.881
and I'm trying to raise them

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:13.201
with healthy expressions of their masculinity.

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:15.301
And this one, I dress like a tiny gentleman.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.840
But if he ever came to me and said he wanted to wear a dress,

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:19.281
that would be okay, too.

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:22.121
And a good way to make sure their masculinity doesn't turn toxic

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.721
is to let them know that it's okay to express themselves.

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:27.521
And even enjoying traditionally feminine things,

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:29.821
activities and dressing is okay.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.520
Things like showing emotion, crying.

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.721
Boys should be able to express those things

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.701
and not have it hamper their masculinity.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.080
Enjoying certain colors and outfits doesn't hamper their masculinity.

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.881
And raising him as his assigned gender at birth

00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:46.241
until he tells you otherwise is perfectly fine.

00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:50.581
It's what happens if he tells you otherwise that really matters.
