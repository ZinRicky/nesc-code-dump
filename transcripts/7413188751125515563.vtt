00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.400
So I'm heading over to a fellow military wife's house right now.

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:06.861
Her husband is also deployed for an extremely long period of time.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.000
Her son has really bad eczema and it's been flaring up since dad left.

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.241
So I'm heading over to drop some of this off,

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:14.161
so hopefully this helps.

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:16.721
She's tried lots of different conventional methods,

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:19.321
so it's time time to try some tallow

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.221
and I'll let you guys know how it goes.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.720
Talal is a wonderful natural way to moisturize your skin.

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.121
It contains natural occurring vitamins

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:29.001
and minerals that help heal your skin,

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.121
which makes it perfect to treat eczema.

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:35.401
This one! It also includes olive oil and vanilla oil,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.721
so it smells absolutely amazing after a few days.

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:41.321
My friend did report back that her son's skin side a hill

00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:42.661
and that just makes me so happy.
