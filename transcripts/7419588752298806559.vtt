Today was a beautiful but very rainy day on the farm,

00:06.520 --> 00:09.040
and I was craving homemade bread,

00:09.041 --> 00:14.021
homemade jam. So we got started on iron corn sandwich bread.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.120
So we put in milk, eggs,

00:16.121 --> 00:18.801
oil, dumped in our iron corn flour,

00:18.802 --> 00:22.341
kneaded that together, and then we dumped it onto a flowered surface

00:22.600 --> 00:25.260
and kneaded it until it was nice and smooth.

00:25.880 --> 00:29.140
And I shaped them into two loaves and let them rise.

00:29.520 --> 00:32.680
And after that, we got started on peach jam,

00:32.681 --> 00:35.501
because I got a bunch of peaches from a friend,

00:35.680 --> 00:38.680
and the peaches this year are so good.

00:38.681 --> 00:41.461
They're huge and they're so sweet.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.680
Lois was in a prep mood. She loved peeling and cutting all the peaches,

00:45.681 --> 00:51.601
so she just stood at her station and was my little worker

00:51.602 --> 00:54.061
for about an hour. Was awesome.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.560
Then we realized we had to go milk the sheep.

00:56.561 --> 00:59.881
So got everyone bundled up and went outside.

00:59.882 --> 01:01.441
At this point, it stopped raining,

01:01.442 --> 01:03.101
so we got the milk pill washed,

01:04.000 --> 01:08.600
we got the feed out, we got my six use in their head locks,

01:08.601 --> 01:12.361
eating their grain. I milk them all for six use.

01:12.362 --> 01:16.341
I'm getting about a gallon and a half of sheep's milk,

01:16.360 --> 01:20.120
and it's my liquid gold. It's so good.

01:20.121 --> 01:23.721
I love it so much. So after we got that strained and in the fridge,

01:23.722 --> 01:25.161
we got served on the Peach Dam.

01:25.162 --> 01:28.461
So I dumped all the prepped peaches into big pot.

01:29.600 --> 01:34.360
I put some fresh thyme, I Kind of wanted an Herbie jam,

01:34.361 --> 01:35.901
so we put some fresh thyme,

01:36.240 --> 01:40.080
a bunch of our honey, then they added some lemon juice as well,

01:40.081 --> 01:42.381
and that's all I put in the jam.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.840
Then I got the jars prepped,

01:44.841 --> 01:47.221
put them on the oven so they were nice and hot,

01:48.520 --> 01:52.880
and prep the lids, and then I dumped the hot mixture into the hot jars,

01:52.881 --> 01:55.041
and voila. That was it.

01:55.042 --> 01:59.641
So easy. And it was literally the best peach jam I've ever had.

01:59.642 --> 02:02.901
So we cut the bread, put some French salts,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.600
homemade butter jam, had it with a glass of milk.

02:06.601 --> 02:08.421
It was a perfect rainy day treat.
