00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.840
The importance of being a stay at home mom and wife is so underrated,

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:06.401
I can't even begin to discuss it,

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:09.401
but I'm going to try to in a short form video.

00:00:09.402 --> 00:00:11.801
My husband works and he is damn good at providing,

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:15.961
but there is nothing that would get done in our family without me.

00:00:15.962 --> 00:00:18.961
And I think about all the things that I miss when I used to work

00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:22.281
and all the freedom and going to an office and being a boss babe,

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:23.281
and all that garbage.

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:27.601
And I have Learned that nothing runs smoothly without my help here.

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:30.321
I think things have changed so drastically in America

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:32.201
that without my help, I mean,

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:36.281
between the poisoning that our children are getting from Big Food

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:38.401
and Big Pharma and Big Ag,

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:42.301
I'm the only buffer between my children and my husband

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.880
and those corporations and the diseases that come with it

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:48.781
and the neurological issues and the endocrine disruptions.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.200
Yes, I do the normal things like I cook and I clean and I do laundry

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.761
and I take care of my children's needs,

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.121
but that is literally

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:59.101
the smallest fraction of what I do in our household.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.520
I have spent months with the money that my husband gives me

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.441
to a lot for herbs and all these remedies.

00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:07.481
And if I showed you my medicine cabinet,

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:09.081
you would freak. But I promise you,

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:11.321
there is almost nothing I cannot cure.

00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:14.521
If everything shut down from the things that I Have in my cabinet.

00:01:14.522 --> 00:01:15.741
Let's take a look.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.920
But when I tell you I have every herb, tincture,

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:26.561
oil, and this has literally cured my children of almost everything.

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:28.081
If my husband calls me and says

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:30.561
I'm feeling sick and I don't know if I can go to work tomorrow,

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:32.801
guess what? I have medicine for that.

00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:36.761
If my toddler is starting to get metal toxicity signs under his eyes,

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:38.481
and neurologically, guess what?

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:40.801
I have a detoxification system for that.

00:01:40.802 --> 00:01:44.121
I hand mill our own grain and make our own bread.

00:01:44.122 --> 00:01:47.081
And I didn't do this just so that I had something to do,

00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:49.441
because I'm so bored as a housewife.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.681
Before the 1900s,

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:53.981
people used to get their bread freshly milled from a baker,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.160
or they had to mill it themselves at home by hand.

00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:58.801
Well, to make it more shelf stable,

00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:02.761
Big Food started stripping the wheat of every nutrients,

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:05.401
like 30 to 50 phytonutrients,

00:02:05.402 --> 00:02:06.921
vitamin E, oil,

00:02:06.922 --> 00:02:09.101
the B vitamins, fiber.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.800
They stripped the brand and the germ away from it

00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:13.341
to make it shelf stable.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.080
There are publications showing that every epidemic disease

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:18.681
started around that time,

00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:21.721
because people were actually dying from certain diseases

00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:24.901
because they took away all the nutrients from our bread.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.680
That's when the government stepped in and said,

00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:29.281
you guys need to put the brand and germ back into it.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.881
And then the food industry said, no,

00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:33.741
we can't do that, because we have a lucrative market.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.120
Aka, they're making Money

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:38.281
by selling the brand and germ to feed companies for cattle,

00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:40.021
pigs, all the things.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.880
So then they said, okay,

00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:42.421
you guys gotta fortify it.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.020
Fortifying empty void.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.400
Nutrient void. Flower.

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.361
Like white flower. They fortified it with so much crap,

00:02:51.362 --> 00:02:54.161
but still we were void of all the minerals and nutrients.

00:02:54.162 --> 00:02:55.761
That is why I follow Sue Becker.

00:02:55.762 --> 00:02:57.561
I listen to podcast every single day.

00:02:57.562 --> 00:03:01.401
I figure out how to feed my family the most nutrient dense foods.

00:03:01.402 --> 00:03:02.681
I don't have to come home from work

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.361
and take my kids to the clinic every other month

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:08.761
because they have some type of sickness or RSV or congestion.

00:03:08.762 --> 00:03:12.001
As a stay at home mom, I am not just a mom.

00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:14.961
I am also a chauffeur, I'm a bus driver,

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:17.781
I am the teacher, I am the family doctor,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.180
and I'm like the spiritual grounding in my home.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.180
And I believe that is what god called us to do.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.560
Even on days when I sit around and I think,

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:28.481
oh my god, I can still do my side hustle,

00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:30.841
I can still work, and sometimes I still do.

00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:33.081
But I am always pressed for time

00:03:33.082 --> 00:03:33.841
because the truth is,

00:03:33.842 --> 00:03:36.041
there's always something else I can do in my family,

00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:39.861
whether it's developing my child's brain and his neurological,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.360
whether it's detoxing him,

00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:45.921
whether it's sitting down and teaching him about our culture

00:03:45.922 --> 00:03:49.641
and the fundamental belief system that me and my husband share.

00:03:49.642 --> 00:03:55.621
If you think being a housewife is Boring or it's void of importance.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.600
You're so wrong I can't even begin to tell you.

00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:03.181
Our entire family runs smoothly right now

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.760
because I am blessed enough to rely on a man who provides for us.

00:04:07.761 --> 00:04:09.481
And then I am allowed to be here,

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:10.921
sit in my feminine energy,

00:04:10.922 --> 00:04:12.481
heal all my chronic illness,

00:04:12.482 --> 00:04:17.041
all my childhood trauma, all my issues from BS modern day feminism.

00:04:17.042 --> 00:04:20.221
I heal my children from those generational curses.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.760
And everything runs smoothly

00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:25.121
because just like a car, stay at home wife.

00:04:25.122 --> 00:04:28.241
She's the engine, she's the one that runs everything.

00:04:28.242 --> 00:04:29.961
And again, I'm not placing importance

00:04:29.962 --> 00:04:32.341
more importance on a wife than I am a husband.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.760
Equally, they're supposed to work together in conjunction.

00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:38.841
When every cog works perfectly in a machine,

00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:42.041
everything runs smoothly. But baby girl,

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:44.961
don't think for a second that you have no importance or value.

00:04:44.962 --> 00:04:46.281
I'm so tired of hearing people,

00:04:46.282 --> 00:04:47.721
oh, I'm just a stay at home wife.

00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:49.281
Yeah, I'm just a stay at home mom,

00:04:49.282 --> 00:04:50.761
just stay at home wife. Like.

00:04:50.762 --> 00:04:52.321
Like just that word.

00:04:52.322 --> 00:04:58.521
Just as if your roll and your purpose in this life isn't so important.

00:04:58.522 --> 00:05:02.561
The reason our entire nation is crumbling at the foundation

00:05:02.562 --> 00:05:05.741
is because we have taken women out of the the household.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.120
I can get deeper into that

00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:09.481
with the whole modern day feminism and all that stuff.

00:05:09.482 --> 00:05:11.641
You guys already know by looking at my other videos.

00:05:11.642 --> 00:05:15.941
But nowadays I guess long form videos are starting to Work.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.080
And I just thought I would get up here and talk about it.

00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:22.601
The danger of telling women they are equal to men,

00:05:22.602 --> 00:05:24.081
that they are the same thing,

00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:26.761
that men can dress up and dresses and be women.

00:05:26.762 --> 00:05:28.361
The danger with that is

00:05:28.362 --> 00:05:34.301
you have greatly degraded the importance and the value of a woman.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.020
There's a reason they call women king makers.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.920
Without US, society fails,

00:05:39.921 --> 00:05:41.621
it falls, it crumbled.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.840
I just wanted to go up here

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.201
and encourage any woman

00:05:44.202 --> 00:05:46.881
who thinks that her role as a stay at home mom or wife

00:05:46.882 --> 00:05:49.201
is not important. You've got it so wrong,

00:05:49.202 --> 00:05:52.741
baby girl. Everything you do is.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.372
It's without us, it's detrimental.
