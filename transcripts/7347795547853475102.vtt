00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.640
Okay, so tomorrow is my birthday. Yay!

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.360
But I, like many people on the internet,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.240
do not identify with my chronological age,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.300
and that if I were to become pregnant tomorrow,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.840
there is no doubt in my mind that I would be a statistic.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.280
I would be a teen mom.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.320
All of this, it has a name,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.600
and it's called Millennial Imposter Syndrome.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.040
And it's where you look at your body and you look at your life,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.520
and you're like,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.460
there is no way that when my parents were this age,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.760
this is what raised me.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.880
So while other generations have a fear of aging,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.360
we. We feel like we're too young for our age.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.480
Some upsides. Um,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.640
like, our skin is amazing.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.500
Apparently. People can't stop talking about it,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.240
but they're also big financial and economic pressures

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.780
and reasons why millennials have been

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.120
doing so less well than their parents.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.560
So, yeah,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.560
I wrote about it for SUBSAC.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.920
You can go subscribe. Uh,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.880
as my birthday gift.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.480
Let me know how you feel about aging.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.040
Do you feel like it differs, um,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.760
for every generation with your relationship to it?

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.787
Let's talk about it.
