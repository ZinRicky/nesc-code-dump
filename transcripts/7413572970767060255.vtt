00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.040
Quick update on what it's been like living with my boyfriend.

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:08.341
We moved in, it's been like July, August,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.380
September. So it's been two months now.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.660
And we moved in with the, like,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.680
the idea of like a village.

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.121
If he's not my kids stepdad,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.041
he calls them roommates. Um,

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:26.981
he doesn't. You know

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.660
that it was.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.880
I think a lot of people did,

00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:34.521
and a lot of people did make comments about like,

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:35.761
how the fuck you gonna live with somebody

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:39.121
and they're not gonna be helping you with your kids and blah, blah, blah.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:42.801
But for me personally, I just don't want somebody.

00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:45.121
I don't. I don't wanna co parent with that many people.

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:46.201
I just don't think it's necessary.

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:50.041
I don't think my kids need more adults talking to them in their life,

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:56.921
so. But because we've never pushed for relationships to build

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:59.801
and because it's just everybody's respected,

00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:00.561
everybody space.

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:05.381
This past weekend, I was having an issue with one of my children,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.320
and I promised one of my other children

00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:09.601
that I would take them to the park.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.021
And so I was like,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.160
I can't be into places at once.

00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:17.961
And you can't provide my child the comfort that they need,

00:01:17.962 --> 00:01:19.661
cause they need it from their mom.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Would you mind taking my other kids to the park for me?

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:25.641
Like, I am.

00:01:25.642 --> 00:01:26.921
They just want to go to the park.

00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:28.521
So if I just explain, like,

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:30.461
Kyle will take you to the park,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.860
you Know, they.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.120
I know they'd be happy. And he was like,

00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:34.841
yeah, sure.

00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:39.481
Happy to help. He took my kids to the park for way longer than, like,

00:01:39.482 --> 00:01:39.841
almost, like,

00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:41.441
an hour. They were at the park,

00:01:41.442 --> 00:01:43.021
they played and had fun.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.200
Then Saturday, we all just hung out,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.100
a really nice time. And then on Sunday,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.120
my daughter with a disability,

00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:54.281
she had a birthday party with one of the kids in her class.

00:01:54.282 --> 00:01:57.481
So this wasn't just a birthday party.

00:01:57.482 --> 00:01:59.181
This was a birthday party

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.220
of all children that have a developmental disability.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.200
You know, sometimes that can be a hard,

00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:07.581
you know, a lot to take in.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.960
And I was like, if I take her to the birthday party,

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:13.581
the other kids are gonna be sad that they're staying home.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.640
But I can't be in two places at once.

00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:17.041
They didn't invite all my kids.

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:19.041
Like, would you want to come with us?

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:22.521
But you would kind of have to hang out with them in the arcade part,

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:23.881
like, while I'm in the birthday party,

00:02:23.882 --> 00:02:24.721
because you know what I mean?

00:02:24.722 --> 00:02:25.401
I was trying to be polite.

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:26.681
Of the birthday party, but everybody,

00:02:26.682 --> 00:02:28.041
it was like, yeah,

00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:30.181
not only did we go to the fucking arcade,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.960
he's like, oh,

00:02:31.961 --> 00:02:33.201
I just bought a card for the kids.

00:02:33.202 --> 00:02:34.161
They're playing, they're having fun.

00:02:34.162 --> 00:02:36.541
And I was like, oh, okay.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.320
And then when we were all hanging out and, like,

00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:41.481
playing video games, one of us,

00:02:41.482 --> 00:02:43.041
one Of my daughter said she was hungry,

00:02:43.042 --> 00:02:43.961
and I was like, okay.

00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:45.321
So I took her to, like,

00:02:45.322 --> 00:02:46.761
the little area that was a Dave and Busters.

00:02:46.762 --> 00:02:48.681
I took her to the little area to sit down,

00:02:48.682 --> 00:02:51.921
and he sat down with us, and then he ordered a few things,

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:53.361
and then he paid for everything.

00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:54.161
And I was like,

00:02:54.162 --> 00:02:56.441
did you just take me and my children out to Dave and Busters?

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:57.401
Like, super cash?

00:02:57.402 --> 00:02:58.741
Like, no big deal.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.060
What? And then we came home.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.940
And then we came home and he cooked dinner.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.380
What?

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.660
It was like the sweetest little weekend.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.200
It was so nice. And it feels like everybody's, like,

00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:23.001
little relationships are starting to form and grow naturally with no,

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.581
like, weirdness.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.980
It's nice. We're all kind of getting into a rhythm.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.640
I feel like all the conflict we kind of had when we first moved in

00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:34.781
was truly just because of the stress of moving.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.100
But it really feels like we're settling into a nice little normal.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.820
Um. I'm not at all trying to say that life is perfect,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.880
but I am really trying to drive home the point that

00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:50.241
you do not need to stay in a miserable marriage.

00:03:50.242 --> 00:03:52.181
You do not need to stay for the kids.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.340
The kids fucking know that your.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.680
Your marriage is miserable.

00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:56.881
And the kids are probably thinking,

00:03:56.882 --> 00:03:59.681
I wish mum and dad would get a fucking divorce already.

00:03:59.682 --> 00:04:01.781
So, um.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.420
And then when you do get a Divorce.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.900
You'll be happy again. Life doesn't end because you got a divorce.
