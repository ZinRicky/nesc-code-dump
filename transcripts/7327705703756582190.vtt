00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.820
There's a few women that are going viral right now

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.280
because they're talking about my man, my man,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.400
my man does everything. My man,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.200
my man. Oh, my god,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.880
I love my man.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.160
And dogging on women.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.740
If your man's not like that,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.680
oh, girl, you don't know what you're missing.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.360
Blah, blah, blah.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.440
In one of the videos,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.680
the woman literally says,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.680
when we go to the restaurant and I wanna order,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.640
I don't even have to say anything.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.140
He orders everything for me.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.840
He. He already knows what I want.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.640
I don't even have to think.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.040
And it's not because I don't know how, you know?

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.400
She's always trying to defend herself.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.240
Another version,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.940
I saw a woman saying,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.580
um, some shit,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.120
oh, when I'm with my man,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.800
I don't have to think.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.140
I can turn my brain off,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.200
and he just does everything.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.960
If I'm moving,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.640
I don't got to worry about the logistics.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.060
My know my man's gonna figure all that out for me,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.060
okay? And where's that gonna fucking leave you

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.000
when the relationship's over?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.160
You've now spent five years,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.440
two years, however long,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.440
with your fucking brain turned off,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.740
forgetting how to make decisions.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.860
That's not the wisest choice for your life.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.680
Let's say your man is the most fucking faithful.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.640
He's never gonna get bored of you.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.360
This whole fucking arrangement

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.440
where he does all the work and all the thinking

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.500
and pays for everything,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.700
that's never gonna backfire.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.940
Let's say he dies,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.800
What the fuck are you going to fucking do?

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.580
Women do outlive men.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.600
Men have a shorter lifespan than women.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.740
So odds are you're gonna spend a chunk of your life,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.580
at the end of your life, alone,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.400
having spent all those years with your brain turned off,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.440
not having a think,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.980
not making decisions.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.760
This is not love.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.920
This is just a really fucking cute form of manipulation.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.980
This is just another way to get you standing behind him,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.360
dependent on him for everything,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.900
while making you think you're in control.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.840
You fucking bitches are crazy.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.200
Giving up that much of yourself

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.400
to another fucking person

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.280
so that you could eat Nana.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.460
You don't know how to cook. You.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.800
The fucking shit storm

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.980
that you're creating for your life.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.600
And then call me better. Go ahead.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.360
Call me better.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.120
Call me old,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.880
call me gray.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.840
Call me whatever the fuck you want.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.760
But you're gonna fucking call me one day

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.160
when that shit fucking fails you.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.860
Good luck. Woof.
