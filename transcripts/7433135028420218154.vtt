00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
The Women's March. I'm 77

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:05.001
and I'm gonna keep going and won't go back,

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:10.581
as I was not always told that I had as much power as I now know I do.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.960
We're voting on Tuesday, and we just wanna do as much as we can

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:17.421
to make sure that our voices are heard.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.720
Democracy. We need everyone to vote,

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:21.881
everyone to do their. Do their job.

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:24.121
I wanna be the owner of my body

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:27.481
and wanna be able to do what I need to do when it's my choice.

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:29.561
Are you voted? I already have.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.961
Wow. Let's see it.

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:32.361
Do it. You're not too young,

00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:34.161
you're not too old. And make the right choice.

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:35.121
And so and so,

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:38.001
when it comes to voting, we need all hands on deck.

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.061
Now get out there and vote.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.640
Don't think that this election doesn't have consequences.

00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.401
Yes, it does,

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:47.381
because it does. It does. Whatever.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.160
If you want your voice to be heard,

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:51.321
you have to make it heard by voting.

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:52.321
Yeah! Get out there, man.

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:54.381
Get out there! Don't be afraid.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.220
Use your voice. You are the future. Please vote.
