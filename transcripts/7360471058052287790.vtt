00:00.960 --> 00:04.120
Today we are making some rocky road ice cream.

00:04.121 --> 00:06.241
So I started off by making marshmallows.

00:06.242 --> 00:08.101
I use gelatin leaves

00:08.360 --> 00:11.240
and put them in cool water so that they could soften.

00:11.241 --> 00:13.081
Then we started on a syrup, which was honey,

00:13.082 --> 00:14.621
golden syrup, and sugar.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.200
We separated some egg whites from the egg yolks,

00:17.201 --> 00:18.361
started mixing those,

00:18.362 --> 00:22.061
and then I added the softened gelatin leaves to the syrup,

00:22.320 --> 00:23.780
added that to the merengue,

00:24.200 --> 00:27.480
and it turned into this beautiful marshmallow whip.

00:27.481 --> 00:30.181
It was so good, you guys.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.780
So good. We started on the ice cream,

00:33.920 --> 00:36.900
and I just scrape the cream off yesterday's milking.

00:37.320 --> 00:41.160
I added the cream, chocolate, and then some whole milk,

00:41.161 --> 00:42.821
and then we heated that up again.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.200
I separated some more egg whites from the egg yolks

00:46.201 --> 00:49.301
and added all those yolks in with some sugar,

00:49.480 --> 00:50.360
beated that up,

00:50.361 --> 00:55.761
and then we slowly added the warm mixed milk mixture to that.

00:55.762 --> 01:00.501
Then we strain that just in case there was any bits of eggs.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.700
We started chopping some chocolate and almonds.

01:03.720 --> 01:07.880
We added it all to the ice cream maker and slowly added in the add ins.

01:07.881 --> 01:09.721
The marshmallows turned out so good.

01:09.722 --> 01:12.781
They were really delicious.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.340
10 out of 10.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.440
We added those to the ice cream while they were mixing as well,

01:17.441 --> 01:21.041
and it turned out to be the best rocky road I've ever had.

01:21.042 --> 01:22.061
It was so good.

01:22.320 --> 01:26.640
We had it for lunch and dinner that night,

01:26.641 --> 01:28.001
and then a little bit for breakfast.

01:28.002 --> 01:29.061
The next morning
