00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.080
Okay, but how stable are your kids

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.720
if the relationship is so fucked up

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.840
that you're thinking about leaving?

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.480
You don't wanna leave,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.600
you're leaving and coming back and leaving,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.420
coming back.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.240
That is not a stable home for children.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.520
You are like,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.560
not fully being honest with yourself about

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.200
the situation.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.520
You're like,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.200
oh, you know,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.600
what does stable for your children mean?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.680
What do you want your children's lives to look like?

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.620
Do you know what I mean?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.440
If the most important thing to you

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.280
is that your children

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.760
see both of their parents every day

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.040
and sleep in the same exact bed at home every day,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.380
and that's what stable is,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.020
sure, that's stable.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.160
But if stable means they have parents that they can

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.400
lean on for emotional support and guidance through life,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.320
and they're

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.060
both of their parents are very present because

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.320
they're not distracted with this abusive relationship,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.900
to me that's stability.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.280
You know, cause we could go on vacation.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.480
What if we had this amazing life

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.720
where we're going on vacations all the time,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.980
we're sleeping everywhere,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.160
Mommy's traveling,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.960
daddy's traveling.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.080
You know, we have this fun,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.220
amazing life

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.560
that's still stable and beautiful,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.740
it's just lacking the abuse.
