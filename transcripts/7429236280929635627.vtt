00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.200
so why is a mother's role so crucial

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:04.440
for the first three years of their child's development

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.600
well according to Doctor Erica Commissar

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:09.960
the first three years is the most critical time for right brain development

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.640
the right brain has many roles

00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:14.080
some of the most important being emotional regulation

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.560
resilience to stress

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:21.160
and can dictate how a child trust people and dictates their future relationships

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:25.140
she claims that we have created two to three generations of people

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.480
unable to form proper attachments and create proper relationship

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:32.400
and unknowingly Gen Zers

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:36.080
Gen Xers and millennials were the Guinea pigs

00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:37.800
the Guinea pigs of modern feminism

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:41.480
saying that women had to go back to work after they had a baby

00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:43.840
that millions of us have now

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:48.040
because of how our relationship to our mother was

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:49.760
in our first three years of development

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:52.680
one of the researchers that she interviewed for her book

00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:57.200
says that women were meant to be the central nervous system of a child

00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:58.760
within their first three years

00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:00.680
cause as we all already know now

00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:04.720
babies and young toddlers are incapable of regulating their emotions

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:08.560
so they have to have you as a mom help them regulate

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:12.240
you know we all started talking recently about the fourth trimester

00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:13.920
this is your postpartum state

00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:15.720
but it also has a lot to do with child development

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:17.120
there's a theory that says

00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:21.000
children were not supposed to be born for at least another nine months

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:22.200
that the only reason they are

00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:27.160
born is because their heads are too large for us to physically hold anymore

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:28.440
just like a carry primate

00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:30.620
just like a koala bear and a gorilla

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.680
and a panda bear every primates always have their babies attached to them

00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:38.040
the first year of your child's life

00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:42.720
should be worn by a mom or close to her at almost all times

00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:44.320
and this is part of their development

00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:48.740
just as it would still be developing inside your in utero

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.360
and without these critical two to three years with your child

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:56.680
we have formed three known attachment disorders

00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:58.720
No. 1 insecure attachment

00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:02.120
No. 2 reactive attachment disorder or R a d

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:05.380
and No. 3 disorganized attachment

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.680
stay tuned for my next video

00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:08.640
because I will go through each attachment

00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:13.600
and how that manifests itself in future relationships when we become adults

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:16.200
let me know in the comments if this interests you

00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:17.999
and I will go into further detail
