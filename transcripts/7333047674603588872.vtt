00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.420
I wanna talk about this kind of

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:11.240
gendered cycle of people pleasing in regards to Taylor Swift

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:12.281
I don't know what it's called

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:15.321
I've just been thinking about it

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:17.841
it's just occurred to me and I've realised something

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:18.801
I'm Doctor Zoe

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:21.241
I have a PhD in digital feminist activism

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:23.121
and I like to make accessible

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.841
content for people to further their feminist identities

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:31.081
so Taylor Swift has made everyone feel very uncomfortable and ill at ease

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:36.241
I think we all knew she was just getting so high

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:39.741
and almost just like half wondering

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.360
she'll fall really far

00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:44.261
and half wondering if she's just untouchable at this point

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.200
she's a billionaire

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:45.761
so in many way

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:46.681
she is untouchable

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:48.601
but in terms of her PR status

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:50.561
as we know from Elon Elon Musk

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:51.641
she's not untouchable

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:54.781
she's actually got just way more to lose

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.520
and I guess a lot of people are commenting on whether it was actually

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.341
appropriate for her to announce a whole new album at the Grammys

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.440
um not to mention a couple of little social faux pas around Lana Del Rey

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:07.601
dragging her up on stage

00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:08.781
the snob of Selena

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.620
um Celine Dion

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.760
the Queen and it got me thinking okay

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.821
because I've been thinking a lot about people pleasing and women

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.600
and I just thought like

00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.961
I'm not that much of a people pleaser

00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:21.041
and I think that that's really great

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:23.921
cause I'm kind of like just no

00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:24.841
that's not gonna hold me back

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:26.561
I don't really care that much

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:27.601
but then I was like

00:01:27.602 --> 00:01:28.961
reflecting lately that actually

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:30.481
I kind of am a people pleaser

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:35.021
just in the way that women just are because of the way that we're socialised

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.340
and that it can play out in different ways

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.600
and we know that Taylor Swift is a self identified people pleaser

00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:45.441
if you've watched Miss Americana

00:01:45.442 --> 00:01:47.041
always wanted to be the good girl

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:49.041
and then it's just never enough for people

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:54.001
and I've been thinking about the rap race and the kind of treadmill of success

00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:56.101
and you get stuck in this cycle

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.220
and I think that that's what happened here with our friend Miss Swift

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.440
and take this with a grain of salt

00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:03.361
because she's a billionaire

00:02:03.362 --> 00:02:04.401
she's a white woman

00:02:04.402 --> 00:02:05.641
and she's Taylor Swift

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:08.281
so this is you know

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:09.401
an ill formed thought

00:02:09.402 --> 00:02:10.361
but basically

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:15.041
women tend to not feel entitled to our success

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:18.241
we've been born into worlds that are vastly unequal

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:20.801
and we're positioned as a second sex

00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:22.341
as Simone de Beauvoir says

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.840
um we are made to feel like our destiny is tied to

00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:29.161
a lot of time our biology

00:02:29.162 --> 00:02:31.181
like our reproductive potential

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.700
um and we know that we end up in domestic servitude

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.900
I forgot one

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.940
but basically

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.400
men do feel entitled

00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:40.461
and women tend to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.720
not have that sense of entitlement over everything and everyone

00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:44.361
and therefore

00:02:44.362 --> 00:02:47.141
when we do achieve success

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.940
we feel like we have to work twice as hard to earn it

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.000
to earn the same recognition of success

00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:55.501
and that when we get it

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.900
we have to keep showing people that we still deserve it

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.060
by continuing to work

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.480
not just twice as hard

00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.301
but I feel like it multiplies

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.480
every time you achieve more status and more success

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.561
so you're never like

00:03:10.562 --> 00:03:12.761
getting to an arrival point and going cool

00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:13.481
I achieved it

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:14.601
I'm posting now

00:03:14.602 --> 00:03:16.041
it's like you get to that point

00:03:16.042 --> 00:03:17.181
you set that goal

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.640
you hit that milestone girl

00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.901
and then you're like cool

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.080
now I have to just

00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:22.201
like feel guilty

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.201
do I deserve it

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:24.381
did I work hard enough

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.720
you know do I have to keep proving to everyone that I do deserve this

00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:28.981
the thing that I worked for

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.380
because now I've got it

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.060
I don't quite believe that I

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.260
did deserve it and I don't

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.020
I feel kind of like an imposter

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.580
and now I just have to like

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.220
work a million times harder

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.820
to keep showing everyone

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.480
that I do deserve it

00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:45.921
and then I achieve the next milestone

00:03:45.922 --> 00:03:46.821
and then I have to

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.160
keep doing that again

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.541
so I'm exhausted

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.160
and I never feel like it's enough

00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:52.821
and I think that's what happened

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.800
with Taylor Swift

00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:56.001
do I think it explains everything

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.201
no like it is

00:03:58.202 --> 00:03:59.341
it's just one

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.120
angle and one take

00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:02.381
but I feel like

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.520
she has achieved like

00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.321
this just ridiculous level of

00:04:05.322 --> 00:04:06.601
like success

00:04:06.602 --> 00:04:07.701
like it's on

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.440
undoubtable like it's

00:04:09.441 --> 00:04:10.521
whether or not you like it

00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:13.141
it's just not deniable um

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.840
and it's almost like

00:04:14.841 --> 00:04:16.221
how does one person

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.460
like come to terms

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.400
with that within

00:04:19.401 --> 00:04:20.361
within themselves

00:04:20.362 --> 00:04:21.281
and Taylor Swift

00:04:21.282 --> 00:04:21.721
we know like

00:04:21.722 --> 00:04:22.481
she's a perfectionist

00:04:22.482 --> 00:04:23.601
we know she's always like

00:04:23.602 --> 00:04:25.361
I want that next thing I want that

00:04:25.362 --> 00:04:26.781
she never stops you know

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.400
and it's like

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:28.821
but when she gets it

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.780
she probably feels this immense pressure

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.060
to prove to everyone that she

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.280
deserves it is the best

00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.621
is the best songwriter

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.040
is the hardest worker

00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:40.641
to keep justifying

00:04:40.642 --> 00:04:42.681
the more and more success she get

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:45.261
so that's why I feel like she announced her album

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.440
apart from like

00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:48.841
obviously taking advantage of the sales

00:04:48.842 --> 00:04:50.001
it was of quite a

00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:51.861
like culturally blind

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.760
thing to do in a lot of ways

00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:54.601
but I feel like

00:04:54.602 --> 00:04:56.241
she felt like she needed to

00:04:56.242 --> 00:04:58.101
because in order to accept

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.920
her record breaking Grammy

00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:01.521
her fourth um

00:05:01.522 --> 00:05:03.141
the only person to get four

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.000
um album of the year

00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:06.161
in order to accept is

00:05:06.162 --> 00:05:07.401
like huge thing

00:05:07.402 --> 00:05:07.881
beating like

00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:08.521
Stevie Wonder

00:05:08.522 --> 00:05:10.141
and everyone else in that category

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.900
she had to then show

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.540
that she is still

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.540
the best and the most deserving

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.340
by using that opportunity

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.140
um well she used the earlier Grammy opportunity

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.220
but still using that opportunity on that night

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.440
to announce yet another album

00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:27.121
when everyone's like

00:05:27.122 --> 00:05:28.441
you just won Grammys for the

00:05:28.442 --> 00:05:30.861
that album you'd seem to have just released

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.100
and now you're

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.400
you know doing another one

00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:34.401
and you've surprised us all

00:05:34.402 --> 00:05:36.401
because we were just expecting a re recording

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:37.281
and now you've done this

00:05:37.282 --> 00:05:38.081
and it's like yes

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:39.121
she has to keep going

00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:40.161
like that next

00:05:40.162 --> 00:05:41.081
step and like

00:05:41.082 --> 00:05:42.421
my question is

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.440
when does that end

00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:45.641
and how does that end

00:05:45.642 --> 00:05:46.981
and where does that go

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.160
um and have you ever felt like that

00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:50.761
have you ever felt like

00:05:50.762 --> 00:05:53.061
the success that you have achieved

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.280
um you then have to

00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:55.841
like justify

00:05:55.842 --> 00:05:57.061
retrospectively

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.440
why you've achieved it

00:05:58.441 --> 00:05:59.741
by continuing

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.180
to go harder than you did last time

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.280
and do you ever feel like you're on that treadmill

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.081
and you don't know

00:06:05.082 --> 00:06:05.641
when it ends

00:06:05.642 --> 00:06:06.561
and how to get off

00:06:06.562 --> 00:06:07.361
lastly I'll just say

00:06:07.362 --> 00:06:08.361
it is gendered

00:06:08.362 --> 00:06:09.541
it is gendered

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.440
absolutely we know that rates of imposter syndrome

00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:13.681
and people pleasing

00:06:13.682 --> 00:06:15.561
are higher in women

00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:17.081
in gender diverse people

00:06:17.082 --> 00:06:19.421
in LGBTQ community in

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.900
uh for people of colour

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.760
for people who aren't basically like

00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:23.601
straight white men

00:06:23.602 --> 00:06:25.221
we know that they

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.560
don't get that feeling of

00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:27.681
entitlement over just like

00:06:27.682 --> 00:06:29.681
claiming everything that they want in the world

00:06:29.682 --> 00:06:30.721
and then when they get it

00:06:30.722 --> 00:06:32.321
they must also feel

00:06:32.322 --> 00:06:34.401
and we must also feel

00:06:34.402 --> 00:06:36.861
um a sense of guilt

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.860
or a sense of why me

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.580
or a sense of

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.100
yeah imposter

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.080
imposter syndrome around

00:06:44.081 --> 00:06:45.601
the success that we do

00:06:45.602 --> 00:06:46.921
manage to achieve

00:06:46.922 --> 00:06:48.561
and so that is why it is

00:06:48.562 --> 00:06:50.361
it is gendered um

00:06:50.362 --> 00:06:51.241
