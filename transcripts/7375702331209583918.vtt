00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
So I have a little bone to pick with Walmart.

00:02.321 --> 00:03.801
I just went in there, and,

00:03.802 --> 00:06.881
you know, in the front section, there's, like, a seasonal section.

00:06.882 --> 00:07.681
They switch it up.

00:07.682 --> 00:08.901
I saw the workers,

00:09.040 --> 00:12.600
they were getting rid of the summer stuff,

00:12.601 --> 00:13.761
the inflatables,

00:13.762 --> 00:14.721
the life vest,

00:14.722 --> 00:16.281
the barbecue stuff,

00:16.282 --> 00:18.041
and they were putting up,

00:18.042 --> 00:19.401
there was already a whole aisle of it.

00:19.402 --> 00:20.641
A back to school stuff,

00:20.642 --> 00:21.521
the notebooks,

00:21.522 --> 00:22.781
the backpacks.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.120
To any other moms or parents get, like,

00:25.121 --> 00:28.281
irrationally upset by seeing back to school stuff.

00:28.282 --> 00:30.681
It makes me so sad and, like, mad.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.321
I'm like, just let us have summer.

00:32.322 --> 00:34.801
Let our kids have summertime. Around here,

00:34.802 --> 00:37.121
the kids got out of school last week,

00:37.122 --> 00:39.641
and we're already talking about going back.

00:39.642 --> 00:41.401
No, no,

00:41.402 --> 00:43.681
let us have summertime, please.

00:43.682 --> 00:44.601
Like, I don't know what it is.

00:44.602 --> 00:45.481
As a kid and as, like,

00:45.482 --> 00:48.801
a teenager, I hated it because I didn't wanna have to go back to school.

00:48.802 --> 00:50.141
And then now as a parent,

00:50.200 --> 00:51.480
like, I hate it even more.

00:51.481 --> 00:53.121
I'm like, oh, no,

00:53.122 --> 00:55.481
just let the kids be home and have fun and be kids.

00:55.482 --> 00:56.961
I, I don't know.

00:56.962 --> 00:57.681
It just, like,

00:57.682 --> 00:59.761
I hate that so much.

00:59.762 --> 01:01.821
Boo, boo! Thumbs down.
