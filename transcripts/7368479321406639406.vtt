00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.960
this is so valid because you want your friends to like your partner

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:04.721
at the end of the day

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:05.681
there's a line

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:07.541
and if they cross that line

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.040
you know when your girls are looking at your man in a different way

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:16.061
or complimenting him or talking about him like chill

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.080
you're not his friend

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:18.201
you're my friend

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:19.801
I had a friend once who

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:22.361
when I showed them my partner who

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:25.041
like drooling over the picture I was showing him

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:26.021
and I was like

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.380
yeah I know he's hot and weird

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.560
you know what happened

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:32.821
she ended up being shady as hell

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.920
that's why I have trust issues with friends

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.321
I'm like by adios

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:37.801
do not have time for it

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:39.336
do not cross that line with me
