00:00.000 --> 00:02.220
It's been a long day, so

00:03.480 --> 00:05.220
we got some food.

00:06.280 --> 00:09.520
Very questionable logo. Yes, very.

00:09.521 --> 00:12.561
We drove from Connecticut to New York at what,

00:12.562 --> 00:13.961
6 a m. This morning?

00:13.962 --> 00:17.461
Yeah. And it's currently 10 20.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.060
Yeah. Let's wake up the baby.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.260
Yeah.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.960
I've been craving donut for so long,

00:26.961 --> 00:28.321
and every time I'm in New York,

00:28.322 --> 00:29.881
we get it. What did you get?

00:29.882 --> 00:30.881
Oh, sorry.

00:30.882 --> 00:34.301
It's okay. I got this box.

00:34.760 --> 00:39.700
I got this. I got two boxes of French fries,

00:40.640 --> 00:42.580
lettuces, onions.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.100
Wait, hold on. Cabbages.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.960
We got two spicy sauces, two white sauces.

00:46.961 --> 00:48.601
I know lucky won't have the white ones,

00:48.602 --> 00:50.581
but you'll have the spicy ones, right?

00:50.720 --> 00:52.800
Lucky has an issue with anything creamy.

00:52.801 --> 00:55.801
I don't know what it is. We've been so busy.

00:55.802 --> 00:57.321
We're gonna be traveling all over,

00:57.322 --> 00:59.201
so we won't be home for the next month.

00:59.202 --> 01:01.521
So that's gonna be wild. I also.

01:01.522 --> 01:02.881
I don't know how I feel about that.

01:02.882 --> 01:04.361
Kind of excited, but also

01:04.362 --> 01:07.941
I'll miss cooking at home cause we'll be doing so much eating out.

01:08.480 --> 01:11.540
Yeah. Which I'm not excited about.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.800
Okay, this is yours?

01:12.801 --> 01:13.241
Oh, my.

01:13.242 --> 01:13.961
Yes, it is.

01:13.962 --> 01:15.121
You're gonna eat all of this?

01:15.122 --> 01:17.861
Yep. You ordered two of these?

01:18.680 --> 01:21.000
What? I love how you're talking,

01:21.001 --> 01:23.181
but I like you're shocked and surprised.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.840
Not really, but then I'm always surprised.

01:25.841 --> 01:27.761
I also have something really exciting coming up.

01:27.762 --> 01:29.221
I'm doing a pop up.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.520
Lucky's actually gonna come support me.

01:31.521 --> 01:32.861
Yes. Um,

01:33.080 --> 01:35.580
I posted everything. Very supportive of you.

01:36.600 --> 01:40.640
I'm gonna Post more updates on my Instagram stories

01:40.641 --> 01:42.441
if you guys wanna come. If you don't,

01:42.442 --> 01:45.441
I totally get it. Just come say hi.

01:45.442 --> 01:47.441
I wanna hang. I wanna hang out.

01:47.442 --> 01:49.321
Ooh, that's good.

01:49.322 --> 01:52.421
Okay, this is what I got. It's basically bread.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.500
It just looks funny on camera.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.560
The orange soda, star of the show.

01:58.561 --> 02:00.561
Here. I got the.

02:00.562 --> 02:02.881

02:06.880 --> 02:08.720
garlic sauce, lettuce,

02:08.721 --> 02:09.901

02:10.360 --> 02:12.400
Also, my eczema has been so bad lately,

02:12.401 --> 02:14.501
and then I wanted a juice box.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.180
Oh, can I try some of your food?

02:18.280 --> 02:18.960
Yes, you can.

02:18.961 --> 02:20.261
You figure out the water?

02:20.960 --> 02:22.740
Was that ice I heard? Yes.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.200
Wow. Stunning.

02:25.201 --> 02:27.141
I've just been snacking on your fries.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.620
Any German words? You. You know,

02:31.560 --> 02:33.540
I didn't think you. Of course.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.240
Lucky always says the most random words,

02:38.241 --> 02:40.561
thinking that they're okay.

02:40.562 --> 02:42.881
Say one real German word that you actually know.

02:42.882 --> 02:45.841
Danke schn. No.

02:45.842 --> 02:47.121
Danke schn. Yeah,

02:47.122 --> 02:48.061
