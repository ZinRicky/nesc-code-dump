00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.160
I just wanted to jump on here for a quick second.

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:06.861
We just finished a Q P question period in the house

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.120
and I wanted to share with folks, uh,

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:12.161
what some of the members of the PC caucus were doing, uh,

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:14.181
during this last question period.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.280
Before I get into that, it's important to know that actually

00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:21.321
today is the start of Phase 4 of the landfill search

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:24.181
for Morgan Harris in Mercedes Myron.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.960
The premiere was there yesterday with the families in ceremony

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.221
and the premiere was there early this morning

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.680
with those folks that are working

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.081
and are going to be actually doing the searching.

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:36.261
Today's a really important day.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.280
Like it's a historical moment right now,

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:42.941
the start of this fourth phase of the landfill search.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.620
And so during question period,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.960
the cabinet ministers that were asked questions

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:53.021
took the opportunity to remind the PC caucus

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.720
what they did in the last provincial election

00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:58.441
in the 2023 election.

00:00:58.442 --> 00:01:03.941
And folks will remember it was a very hateful and divisive campaign.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.140
But they also centered their campaign

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.140
over the question of searching the landfill.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.840
They centered the campaign on the murders of indigenous women

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.421
by a serial killer,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.860
you know, something that has never been done in politics,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.140
really one of the most grotesque moments in politics.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.860
And to this day,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.440
each and every one of those PC caucus members that got elected

00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:34.141
under that hateful

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.740
anti indigenous misogynistic election has never apologized,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.240
has never apologized for What their election,

00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:46.861
with their party, with their people did during that campaign.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.080
And so during QP today, our members that got up

00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.181
took the opportunity to remind them of what they did.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.640
And while our folks were answering those questions,

00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.601
I want to share with you what some of them were doing.

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:01.941
But let me start also just with last week.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.920
The member for Turtle Mountain,

00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:07.761
this guy said, yelled across the way and said,

00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:10.541
it's in the past. Get over it.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.440
It was literally 14 months ago today.

00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:15.961
The member for Brandon West,

00:02:15.962 --> 00:02:17.961
this guy, uh,

00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:20.101
sat there smirking and laughing

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.040
while our cabinet ministers were getting up

00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:25.601
and reminding them about their political campaign.

00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:28.421
The member for Springfield, Rashad,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.360
this guy was doing this to the premier.

00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:33.801
Every time the premier was getting up

00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:35.441
and reminding them of what they did,

00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:38.061
he was going like this to the premier,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.640
just being so dismissive about what the Premier was,

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:45.001
was bringing forward in the house.

00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:46.681
The member for Swan River,

00:02:46.682 --> 00:02:49.081
which I don't know why he's still in MLA

00:02:49.082 --> 00:02:52.561
and you, all you have to do is just Google his name and what he did.

00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:54.481
How he still in MLA, I don't know.

00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:56.041
But the member for Swan River

00:02:56.042 --> 00:03:00.441
throughout the whole QP was laughing and talking

00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:03.241
every time members of our cabinet were getting up

00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:05.081
and talking about the landfill search,

00:03:05.082 --> 00:03:09.081
blatantly just laughing. The member for Red River North,

00:03:09.082 --> 00:03:14.241
this guy who routinely has his back to The premier and to all of us

00:03:14.242 --> 00:03:15.961
when we get up to answer his questions

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:18.341
was also doing the same gestures,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.580
like just dismissing what we are bringing forward.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.640
So why do I take the time to do this and share this with you?

00:03:25.641 --> 00:03:26.801
Because it is important

00:03:26.802 --> 00:03:31.261
for Manitobans to know that these folks have never said their story.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.620
And these folks, up until literally 15 minutes ago,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.320
still don't care and act with such contempt over indigenous women

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:44.481
who were murdered by a serial killer

00:03:44.482 --> 00:03:46.681
and for their families. And I,

00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:48.881
for one, and I know all of our caucus

00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:51.721
will never let them forget what they did

00:03:51.722 --> 00:03:56.001
during one of the most grotesque provincial campaigns in our history.

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:57.981
So I wanted to share that with you.
