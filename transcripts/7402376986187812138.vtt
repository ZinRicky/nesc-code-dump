00:00.000 --> 00:01.080
You ever smell a scent

00:01.081 --> 00:04.081
and it reminds you of something that you've eaten before?

00:04.082 --> 00:07.201
Ever since I started using the Mason Margiela Replica

00:07.202 --> 00:09.061
Afternoon Delight fragrance,

00:09.080 --> 00:12.420
all I can think about is making vanilla custard.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.480
Reminds me of all the moments I spend in Paris

00:15.481 --> 00:17.881
indulging in sweet afternoon pastries,

00:17.882 --> 00:20.481
especially those with a custard base.

00:20.482 --> 00:22.681
The scent smells warm and sweet,

00:22.682 --> 00:24.961
and you can really smell the vanilla in it.

00:24.962 --> 00:26.921
I started making my custard,

00:26.922 --> 00:28.801
bringing it to a boil on the stove,

00:28.802 --> 00:31.081
and I pulled it off, added my vanilla bean,

00:31.082 --> 00:31.761
some butter,

00:31.762 --> 00:35.741
whisked that all together before pouring it into a bowl to cool.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.420
After a few hours, it was the perfect consistency,

00:38.560 --> 00:42.480
so I plated it up. I always need some strawberries with my custard,

00:42.481 --> 00:44.934
and this was the perfect afternoon delight.
