00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.340
well John I am very sorry

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.580
for my strong response to a comment that was meant to be nice

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.480
I do um usually assume men are being mean

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.361
cause that's been my experience

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:18.701
so thank you for um

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.940
explaining I apologize

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.920
appreciate you and your um

00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:26.161
contribution

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.361
so truly I'm sorry

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.041
if I'm gonna call you out all big and loud

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:31.981
I will apologize big and loud

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.100
so thank you for being a kind voice

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.440
and I'm sorry

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:39.521
like truly I'm sorry

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.361
I wasn't trying to come at you

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:43.321
but I did just want to use it as a talking point

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:45.361
like if somebody was saying it in a nasty way

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:46.281
but that doesn't give it

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:46.681
you know what I mean

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:47.721
I'm not trying to justify what I did

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:48.881
I'm just saying I misunderstood

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.541
I'm sorry I'm sorry
