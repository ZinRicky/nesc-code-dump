00:00.040 --> 00:02.880
Here's everything I ate today while not being able to cook

00:02.881 --> 00:04.881
since we're out in Connecticut right now.

00:04.882 --> 00:07.061
We started our day off at Arden's.

00:07.120 --> 00:08.440
I need multiple beverages,

00:08.441 --> 00:10.481
so I had a matcha latte, orange juice,

00:10.482 --> 00:11.961
hot chocolate, and some tea.

00:11.962 --> 00:15.001
I ordered this mushroom toast with over easy eggs.

00:15.002 --> 00:16.321
They weren't quite perfect,

00:16.322 --> 00:19.481
but it still worked. Before I could even start eating my food,

00:19.482 --> 00:21.761
lucky was already done with his breakfast tacos

00:21.762 --> 00:23.681
and got his second round of food.

00:23.682 --> 00:26.801
This toast was so good. I've always loved mushrooms,

00:26.802 --> 00:28.561
so this toast was so good.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.761
I'm still thinking about it.

00:29.762 --> 00:31.481
I kind of wanna go back to have it.

00:31.482 --> 00:32.801
But after we had breakfast,

00:32.802 --> 00:35.761
we headed over to the stables to see some horses.

00:35.762 --> 00:38.681
Rumbles been begging me, and Paige was so nice to let us.

00:38.682 --> 00:40.041
After we were done with that,

00:40.042 --> 00:42.401
I really wanted some good apples,

00:42.402 --> 00:45.321
so we went to pick some and filled a little bag with them.

00:45.322 --> 00:46.681
Nothing beats a fresh apple.

00:46.682 --> 00:50.201
I also picked up some plums since my parents are coming into town.

00:50.202 --> 00:52.401
And then we headed over to get some lunch.

00:52.402 --> 00:54.361
Pizza seems to be a staple around here,

00:54.362 --> 00:56.961
so we went to this pizza place that looked really good,

00:56.962 --> 00:58.561
and we got one of their salads,

00:58.562 --> 01:00.421
which was just a simple salad,

01:00.480 --> 01:01.700
nothing groundbreaking.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.520
We also got some pepperoni pizza with some peppers and onion on it.

01:05.521 --> 01:07.801
And I got a Margarita pizza as well.

01:07.802 --> 01:08.401
Obviously

01:08.402 --> 01:11.801
had to top our Slices with some Parmesan cheese and chili flakes.

01:11.802 --> 01:13.481
And this was actually really,

01:13.482 --> 01:14.121
really good.

01:14.122 --> 01:17.881
I ended up having half of the pepperoni and half of the Margarita one,

01:17.882 --> 01:19.741
and we headed over to the mall.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.640
Lucky made me try this cinnamon roll,

01:21.641 --> 01:24.681
which was vile. I don't know why these are so popular.

01:24.682 --> 01:27.041
And then for dinner, I just was craving some meat.

01:27.042 --> 01:28.601
So we found this steakhouse,

01:28.602 --> 01:32.081
got a mocktail, lucky got this spinach artichoke dip that I tried,

01:32.082 --> 01:34.401
and then I just got a classic steak and fries.

01:34.402 --> 01:37.641
I couldn't finish it all, so lucky ended up finishing my plate.
