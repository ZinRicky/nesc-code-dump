00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
Not to sound, like, really stupid,

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:03.801
but is the Boston Marathon longer than the LA Marathon?

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:05.501
No, all marathons are the same length.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.080
That's a common sense,

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.561
I fear. Are you serious?

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:13.981
I'm serious. All marathons are 26.2 miles.
