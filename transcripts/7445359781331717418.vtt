00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.800
so my husband and I always do a holiday staycation

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.840
a little date night to get away from the kids

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:08.880
have a little romance and I found the perfect dress on TikTok shop

00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.220
and I just came in and I tried it on

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.580
and it's very affordable which is what I liked because

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.760
you know we can't always be spending so much money on the like

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:21.400
the holiday occasion dresses

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:22.320
but what I liked about this

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.400
too is it has a very classic silhouette

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:26.080
it cinches you in right here

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:28.040
and then it ties in the back

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:30.020
so the girls are super supported

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.260
very important

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.240
but I'm just gonna pair it with like

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:36.680
some cute black heels and I feel so glamorous

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:37.720
and maybe with like

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:40.220
a little bit of fur on top to cozy up

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.100
this is a perfect holiday dress

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.500
I knew when I saw it in the red it was going to be tonight

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.500
very old Hollywood I loved it
