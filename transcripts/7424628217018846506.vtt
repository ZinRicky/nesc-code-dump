00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.080
Girl looking dance like that.

00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:07.441
This is what kills me about feminist,

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:11.841
because the minute they see a woman in a position where they are happy,

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:16.281
but it is outside of the traditional hustle grind, boss, babe,

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.401
get a career, have a job, etcetera,

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:19.561
they lose their minds.

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:22.561
And I think what's even worse is looking at someone's situation

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:25.441
where they have have said multiple times that they love their life,

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.741
the life that they created along with their spouse and their partner.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.080
Y'all think it's abuse? I used to once be a very driven person

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:35.521
with intentions of becoming like

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:38.601
in a lucrative medical based career, okay?

00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:42.601
And I chose the housewife life over that.

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:44.161
And people thought I was crazy.

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:47.201
They probably still think I'm crazy and stupid for even choosing that.

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:49.241
It's okay to change what you want in life.

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:51.721
The older you get and the more experiences you have.

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:54.281
You don't have to stay on the single path you've been on.

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:55.081
But part for the quiz,

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:57.481
it's believe all women till you disagree with their lifestyle

00:00:57.482 --> 00:00:59.120
and then you use them for clout on the internet.
