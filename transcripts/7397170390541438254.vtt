This has been my new favorite late night snack.

00:04.120 --> 00:08.300
I usually do sweet ones, but this is a little bit more savory.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.400
I roasted this purple sweet potato,

00:11.401 --> 00:13.941
and I love having it with kimchi,

00:14.080 --> 00:19.320
so this is what I do. I roasted my sweet potato for about 45 minutes,

00:19.321 --> 00:21.641
and then I got it out the oven,

00:21.642 --> 00:25.761
peeled it, and I made this kimchi a while ago,

00:25.762 --> 00:29.801
so I just been eating out of this big jar,

00:29.802 --> 00:35.221
and I love the combination of this sweet potato with savory kimchi,

00:35.600 --> 00:38.660
so I usually just take a little bit,

00:39.840 --> 00:42.100
I peel my sweet potato,

00:42.640 --> 00:47.240
put some kimchi on it, and just snack on this.

00:47.241 --> 00:49.561
It's way past my bedtime. I shouldn't even be up.

00:49.562 --> 00:54.381
It's past 12 right now, but I just needed a little midnight snack.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.680
My favorite pieces of kimchi are the ones that are the leafy ones,

01:00.681 --> 01:02.501
not the hard ones.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.160
Mm hmm.

01:05.240 --> 01:08.180
These are so sweet, they're almost caramelized.
