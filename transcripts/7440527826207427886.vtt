00:00.080 --> 00:00.600
alright guys

00:00.601 --> 00:03.880
I tried one of the viral micro curling wands I've seen on TikTok

00:03.881 --> 00:06.160
and here's my experience I have very

00:06.161 --> 00:09.440
very straight hair so I was skeptical that this would even work for me

00:09.441 --> 00:10.480
but I was gonna try it anyway

00:10.481 --> 00:12.380
so I sectioned off my hair

00:12.480 --> 00:15.280
and then I took a pretty small pieces and wrapped them around

00:15.281 --> 00:16.840
this particular one gets really hot

00:16.841 --> 00:18.600
so I did not let it sit at all

00:18.601 --> 00:19.680
as soon as I was done wrapping

00:19.681 --> 00:21.720
I released it it gave me these super

00:21.721 --> 00:23.960
super tight bouncy curls

00:23.961 --> 00:26.820
and so I just kept doing it on my whole head

00:27.160 --> 00:28.800
I also film this in the kids playroom

00:28.801 --> 00:30.740
so that's why there are some toys in the background

00:30.960 --> 00:32.920
anyway I have very straight and fine hair

00:32.921 --> 00:34.760
but I have a lot of it so it took me a little while

00:34.761 --> 00:36.560
and then this is kind of what it looked like after

00:36.561 --> 00:39.640
I have never ever seen my hair anywhere close to this curly

00:39.641 --> 00:42.260
so it was honestly so unexpected

00:42.280 --> 00:45.240
I brushed it out and I know it looks super crazy here

00:45.241 --> 00:46.480
but hear me out I brush it out

00:46.481 --> 00:47.900
and then I got some hair oil

00:48.040 --> 00:49.420
ran it through my fingers

00:49.440 --> 00:51.200
and this is how it turned out

00:51.201 --> 00:52.400
and I really really

00:52.401 --> 00:55.120
really loved it I believe this one is 3 8 7 inch

00:55.121 --> 00:57.840
and this is the best price I have found for them so far

00:57.841 --> 01:00.094
here's my before and after go check them out
