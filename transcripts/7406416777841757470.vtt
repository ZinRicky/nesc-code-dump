00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.300
Just a reminder to the married women that are miserable right now.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.340
Divorce is an option. And it's not the end of the fucking world.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.720
Matter of fact, that is it.

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:12.021
Not only is it not the end of the world,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.480
it's probably the start of your new life.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.661
A life that you never thought was possible.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.360
A life that you kinda only dreamed of.

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:20.601
Because when you finally say,

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:23.081
fuck it, I don't care what people think about me,

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:24.601
I don't care what people say about me.

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:26.641
I can't do this anymore. I can't live like this anymore.

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:29.201
And you choose yourself. You realize how.

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:30.841
How small those voices are anyway.

00:00:30.842 --> 00:00:32.601
They're just little whispers in the wind

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:34.261
while you're out there frolicking,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.400
having the most fun of your life.

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.081
So if you're in a miserable marriage

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:40.541
and you think about divorce regularly,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.960
go ahead and do it. You will not regret it.

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.761
The. The thing that you'll regret

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:48.161
is staying in that marriage longer than you wanted to

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:51.921
and giving him years and years and years that should have been yours.

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:53.641
So if you are on the fence,

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:54.521
if you're thinking about it,

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:57.881
I. I am living proof to tell you you can get out.

00:00:57.882 --> 00:00:58.881
You can make it,

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:01.761
and you can be happier than you ever fucking dream possible.

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:04.041
I got four kids. One of them is disabled.

00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:05.761
She's got congenital heart disease.

00:01:05.762 --> 00:01:07.421
She's had four open heart surgeries.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.460
If you want it bad enough, you can Get it
