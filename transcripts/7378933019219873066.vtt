00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.800
remember when I got my first job as a graphic designer

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.360
when I walked into the office

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:05.160
it was uh

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.940
I was in the art department for um

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.800
a corporate hotel

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.740
and it was a privately held corporate hotel

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.040
so I was like

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.800
literally would ride the elevator up to the corporate level

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.800
um I don't know if you've ever heard of Westgate Resorts

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:19.220
but um

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.640
David Siegel like

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:21.720
when you got out of the elevator

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:24.760
David Siegel's office doors were right there

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:25.760
and then I walked around the corner

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:26.120
so I was like

00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:29.380
literally on the executive floor at this like

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.600
bajillion dollar

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:32.920
there's like documentaries about him

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:36.520
it was it was fucking so overwhelmingly intimidating

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:37.080
I was like oh

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.640
my god I feel like I don't belong here

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.900
like the imposter syndrome was so fucking strong

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.660
then when I walked into the office that I had to work

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.320
they were like oh

00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:45.840
here you go and there was like eight

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:46.320
there was one

00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:47.040
two three four

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.060
there was like six graphic designers

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.760
our creative director had his office inside of our office

00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:54.400
there was like this like

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:58.580
little glass fish bowl of his office inside of the creative department

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.520
it was so overwhelming

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:03.580
and then all the cubicles were open

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.240
and the way you sat your computer was kind of in the corner

00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:10.040
and so anybody who walked up and down could see what you were working on

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:14.180
so I was fucking mortified

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.620
I was like I have to design

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.640
I don't know I feel like it's

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:19.800
it is such a private like

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm always so impressed at musicians or anybody who puts their art out there

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.040
because you aren't putting a part of like

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:27.720
your heart out there for people

00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:28.280
and you're like

00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:28.680
oh my god

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:29.480
are they gonna like it

00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:30.160
like oh

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:32.600
like what if they say something uglier

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:33.360
oh my god

00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:35.520
what if it's not received well anyway

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.240
I met one of my like

00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:38.880
best friends in life there

00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:40.980
we still are friends to this day

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.640
her ex husband is actually being a total piece of shit right now

00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:48.760
and treating her like shit

00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:53.000
and there are just so many women in my life that have um

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:54.560
supported me and encouraged me

00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:55.080
and honestly

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.760
there are so many men in my life that have hurt me and disappointed me

00:01:57.761 --> 00:01:58.360
and let me down

00:01:58.361 --> 00:01:59.160
so

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.100
um thank you for the support

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.200
sorry to get all emotional

00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:09.740
but I've poured my heart and soul into everything so thank you
