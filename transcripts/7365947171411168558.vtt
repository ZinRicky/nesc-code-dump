00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.240
The type of woman

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:07.741
that will date a man that is in conflict with the mother of his child

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.040
is not gonna be open to hearing what the fuck you have to say.

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:12.961
There is no point in reaching out to her.

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:14.161
If you reach out to her,

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:16.701
the only thing you're going to do

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.520
is confirm to her the lies that he's already told her.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.381
Because don't you even think

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.540
their first date was not just a full on trauma bond session,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.720
just venting.

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:31.441
And she's telling her all the ways these men have hurt her

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:33.241
and all her insecurities,

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.241
basically giving him an entire fucking roadmap

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:37.361
on how he could fucking abuse and manipulate her.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:38.841
He's eating it up

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:42.441
and telling her all the fucking crazy things that you did

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:45.281
that line up with what her ex did.

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:46.561
So now they're like,

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:51.241
oh, my god, nobody fucking gets me like you got me.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:54.201
It's like Anna and Hans in the fucking car.

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:56.341
Love is an open door.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.640
Love bombing the fuck out of each other and they're hooked.

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:05.661
So you reach out to her and now she's trying to break up our love.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.800
Girls, don't even do it.

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:08.081
It's not worth it.

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:12.021
Let them have each other because they are each other's karma.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.380
They are each other's karma.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.500
Don't even bother.
