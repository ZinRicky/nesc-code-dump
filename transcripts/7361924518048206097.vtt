00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.720
I took two weeks off for a total social media detox

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:04.801
and here's how I found myself really missing

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:06.041
over sharing my intrusive

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:08.761
inner monologue with strangers who didn't ask to hear it.

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:09.761
So from today, day 1,

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:11.161
I started writing my thoughts down.

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:12.281
Totally radical concept

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:15.641
and I believe it's got a soft J pronounced urinal and quite cathartic.

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:17.041
But please don't read my urinal.

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:19.641
I had zero minutes of screen time for the first 7 days.

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:20.481
And in the second week,

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:23.561
I thought I might treat myself and find a cute new show on Netflix.

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:25.921
It wasn't even a baby reindeer.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:28.521
When that plan backfired, I thought I'd try some light reading instead

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:30.521
by revisiting my favorite treetop manual.

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:31.881
And this is gonna be right up there

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:34.001
with some of the best self help books of all time.

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.761
I don't know what it is. I just always find it

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:36.961
puts me in the right headspace

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:40.121
to enjoy the domestic bliss that comes with raising my three

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:41.441
fetal collaborations.

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:44.481
I like to gaslight myself into believing that I am actually Lobotomy

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:47.401
Barbie and everything is so much better when I do live laugh,

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:50.321
lobotomize. Then I got stuck into reading The Silent Patient

00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:51.961
where I realized that becoming a mute

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:55.161
unhinged ward of the state sounded like a fucking dream vacation.

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:56.601
So I went ahead and caught Covid

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:57.761
and sadly during this

00:00:57.762 --> 00:00:59.841
I Learned I can't keep my mouth shut for the life of me

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:01.881
and all this talk. Of covid in the bottom is

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:03.841
got me really in the mood for some homemade bread.

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:05.561
I think I glitched and got stuck in a loop

00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:07.921
because I made about 10 batches of this for counter.

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:09.841
But I also think I might have finally nailed it.

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:11.361
And if you're wondering where the children are,

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:14.001
don't worry, I made sure to give them lots of special attention

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:15.961
and we played Monopoly Knockout for hours.

00:01:15.962 --> 00:01:18.201
My youngest was sad cause she wanted to go first.

00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:20.401
My older two boys were constantly rough housing

00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:21.761
and I'll leave it up to you to decide

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:23.681
whether I'm protecting my children's privacy

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.621
or they're a figment of my imagination.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.880
Don't worry darling. I did leave the house at one point

00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:29.521
and that was for puppies and puppies only.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:30.761
And I think we can all agree that

00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:33.361
only leaving the house for puppies is a perfectly valid reason.

00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:36.201
But I was there solely for therapy because unlike some men,

00:01:36.202 --> 00:01:37.481
one bitch is enough for me.

00:01:37.482 --> 00:01:40.041
I did some things to keep me mentally and physically supple,

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:42.561
mainly because I don't want my husband to run away with a sick,

00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:44.641
although that would be pretty fucking strange

00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:46.961
considering his secretary is actually his father.

00:01:46.962 --> 00:01:48.361
But my mama raised me with the mantra

00:01:48.362 --> 00:01:50.681
that low odds is not the same as no odds.

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:52.721
And I finished my yoga with my favourite pose,

00:01:52.722 --> 00:01:56.141
corpse pose, which is another way of saying I'd lay down for 2 hours.
