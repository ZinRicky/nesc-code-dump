00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Single mothers raise criminals.

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:05.961
Single mothers raise the worst kids on the planet.

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:07.741
Single mother. Single mother.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.280
Yeah well how about you're so fucking busy arguing with your husband

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:13.681
whilst talk about what your fucking kids turn out like.

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.641
All the fucking therapy that your kids need,

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:16.921
all the fucking re evaluating

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:18.601
of what a real relationship should fucking look like.

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:21.381
Cause they've been watching your fucked up ass fucking marriage

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.760
all those years. Let's talk about that.

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:27.361
Stop talking about the fucking criminal rate of children

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:29.081
that were raised by single mothers.

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:30.721
Cause there's mad fucking criminals in the world

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:32.241
that were raised by ugly ass people

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:34.221
that stayed married when they shouldn't have.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.040
So quit fucking focusing on single mothers.

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:39.241
Cause I'm positive that the people who found those statistics

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:40.521
and we're doing that study

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:41.281
weren't doing it

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:43.121
so you could throw it in a fucking single mother's face

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.941
and be like your kids gonna be a criminal.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.640
It wasn't some fucking clap back to single mothers.

00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:52.681
I'm sure it was to show the support areas where there could be

00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:54.881
where we could inject more love and support.

00:00:54.882 --> 00:00:57.021
Not fucking criticism and judgement.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.000
Cause it's probably an ugly shitty marriage

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.261
setting ugly shitty example.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.700
Don't feel bad cause you're a single mom.
