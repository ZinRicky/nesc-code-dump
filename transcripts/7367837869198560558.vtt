00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
My husband got back from a work trip last night

00:02.321 --> 00:04.841
and he mentioned that he had this really good chocolate

00:04.842 --> 00:06.241
peanut butter cup ice cream,

00:06.242 --> 00:08.401
so I decided to make him some today.

00:08.402 --> 00:10.921
I started by making my peanut butter cups.

00:10.922 --> 00:14.521
To do that, I started with the filling by making some Graham crackers.

00:14.522 --> 00:18.081
I combined butter and sugar with some flour, cinnamon,

00:18.082 --> 00:19.481
some milk, and honey.

00:19.482 --> 00:20.841
Let that all come together

00:20.842 --> 00:22.521
and then refrigerated my dough

00:22.522 --> 00:25.141
while I got started on making some peanut butter.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.400
I blended up my roasted peanuts until it reached the consistency

00:28.401 --> 00:32.321
I wanted, set that aside, and then got started on my ice cream base.

00:32.322 --> 00:36.121
Mix some heavy cream with some dark cocoa and added some chocolate.

00:36.122 --> 00:38.121
While that all heated up on the stove,

00:38.122 --> 00:40.681
I separated my egg whites from my yolks

00:40.682 --> 00:43.341
and then poured in some of my warm milk.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.960
I let that come up to temperature

00:44.961 --> 00:47.281
and then transferred it back over to my milk,

00:47.282 --> 00:50.201
let it thicken up until it coated the back of my spoon

00:50.202 --> 00:53.081
before combining that with my chocolate and heavy cream

00:53.082 --> 00:54.481
and putting that in the fridge.

00:54.482 --> 00:56.541
At this point I pulled out my dough,

00:56.560 --> 00:59.120
rolled it out, and poked some holes in it.

00:59.121 --> 01:00.641
Let that bake until crispy,

01:00.642 --> 01:03.161
and I made sure to let them cool fully

01:03.162 --> 01:05.961
before breaking them up and adding them to my blender

01:05.962 --> 01:09.061
and pulsing them until they turned into crumbs.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.600
Combine them with some powdered sugar

01:10.601 --> 01:12.961
and then added in My peanut butter

01:12.962 --> 01:14.601
and giving that a really good mix

01:14.602 --> 01:17.481
before lining my muffin tin with some liners,

01:17.482 --> 01:20.721
brushing those with melted chocolate before refrigerating them,

01:20.722 --> 01:22.201
and then once they'd set,

01:22.202 --> 01:26.281
scoop to my peanut butter filling and with more chocolate.

01:26.282 --> 01:27.881
All those were setting in the fridge.

01:27.882 --> 01:31.601
I poured my ice cream mixture into my Turner and let that turn.

01:31.602 --> 01:33.441
I pulled pulled out my peanut butter cups,

01:33.442 --> 01:36.241
chopped them up, and added them to my ice cream.

01:36.242 --> 01:38.301
Once it reached soft serve consistency,

01:38.440 --> 01:41.680
I transferred my mixture over to my dish

01:41.681 --> 01:45.501
before putting some more chopped up peanut butter cups on top.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.560
Set that in the freezer for a few hours,

01:47.561 --> 01:51.181
and lucky said it was the best ice cream he's had in a while.
