00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
I’m constantly amazed how we as a society do not speak truthfully or honest

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:06.801
to the people closest to us

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:10.881
We think it’s hard to speak directly and we’re never fully truthful

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:13.381
just to spare hurting someone's feelings

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.640
why do we do that?

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:17.161
I know not all circumstances are the same,

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:19.981
but why are we so afraid to be honest?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.120
Don’t we want to surround ourselves with people

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:24.541
who are willing to tell us the hard truth?

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.720
How do we grow individuals if we're simply not willing to hear it?

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.761
I need people around me that are truthful and honest

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:33.481
even if it comes at the expense of my own feelings

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:35.121
you're simply not helping me,

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:37.041
if you can't be honest with me,

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:38.861
don't dodge the issue,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.680
don't hesitate or withhold information from me,

00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:44.161
just tell me how it is

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:47.621
don't tell me lies to my face just so you can spare my feelings

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.520
so society believes that that's helpful,

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:52.341
when really it's far from it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.240
I would 100% rather have my friends or people closest to me telling me how it is,

00:00:58.241 --> 00:00:59.501
than lie to my face.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.080
The people closest to you really should have your best interest at heart,

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:06.821
so they should be willing to be upfront with you and honest,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.740
They should be direct and truthful to you

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.420
even if it's hard and it hurts your feelings at times.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.780
basically what's the point of comforting someone with a lie?
