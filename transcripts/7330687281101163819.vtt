00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.340
I feel like not a lot of guys realize this

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.240
but being a SIMP is probably one of the hardest things you can do as a man

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.461
being a loving

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.100
devoted partner

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.720
taking her out to dinner

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.281
opening her door

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.981
getting her flowers

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:18.060
once you do all that

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.800
she's gonna run to all of her friends and brag about you

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:25.981
and she tells all of her friends about you

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.820
they're gonna think of you as a hero and think ugh

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.520
wish I had a guy like that

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.921
that's what I want

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:35.701
I think of you as the ideal man

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.980
gonna seem really cool to them

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.460
and on the opposite spectrum

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.120
the anti sip behaviours

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:44.721
the view of thinking ugh

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:46.601
I'm not gonna call her back

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:48.121
I'm not gonna buy her flowers

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:49.801
she's never bought me flowers

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:51.901
why do I need to get her flowers

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.740
that type of behaviour

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.200
she's gonna go and tell her friends about it

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:57.821
and you know what they're gonna say

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.380
they're gonna be like ugh

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800
I'm so sorry babe

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:03.061
you're gonna find the right one eventually

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.960
not only that

00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:04.841
when they see you

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:06.681
they're gonna be like Ew gross

00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:08.161
he doesn't know how to treat a woman

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:09.941
this goes both ways

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.640
if you're a good girlfriend

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:13.901
good partner

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.160
your guy is gonna run to his friends and brag about you

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.761
if you're controlling

00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:21.881
crazy annoying partner

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:24.761
he's gonna run to his friends and complain about you

00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:28.261
don't you wanna be the girl that all of his friends are like

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.160
well you got a good one

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:33.261
like the envy of everybody

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.380
that's how power couples are made

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.600
only people who look down on simping are the same people who can't find a loving

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.081
devoted partner

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:46.821
so don't forget that simping is simply in
