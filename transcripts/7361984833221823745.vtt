00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.800
This is a PSA. If you're a woman in Australia or an ally

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:06.641
who cares about how many women this year have been killed

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:09.361
and the ongoing scourge of violence against women in this country.

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:11.481
There are rallies in almost every city and many,

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:13.921
many regional centres. Please come.

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:15.301
There are amazing speakers.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.920
I know that because I am one of them.

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:21.521
I am going to be speaking in two of the regional centres

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:24.961
because a lot of violence against women is regional

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:27.161
and we often get forgotten about.

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:30.281
I will be speaking tonight at the Ballarat rally at five PM

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:34.041
and I'll be speaking at the Bendigo rally at 11:00am on Sunday.

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:38.121
We are saying no to violence and we are demanding preventative,

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:41.341
proactive action from our government on this epidemic.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.080
One woman every four days has been killed

00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:45.261
on average here in Australia this year.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.400
This year, 31 women this year.

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:51.461
Today, the Harvey Weinstein case got overturned.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.140
If that doesn't make you mad,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.320
wanting to rally, I don't know what will.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:58.461
Our stories and our voices have remained invisible,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.560
unheard, unseen for far too long

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.701
and they are no longer invisible.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.380
We together can make sure our stories are heard.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.060
We are more powerful when we stand together as a collective.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.120
These events are about demanding change,

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:21.861
but they're also about hope and justice and collective action.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.140
I really hope that I see you there.
