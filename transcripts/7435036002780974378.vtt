00:00.000 --> 00:03.940
It's been a long day. So we got some tacos tonight.

00:04.040 --> 00:06.320
I got four hours of sleep last night.

00:06.321 --> 00:10.561
Probably even less cause I woke up in between those four hours.

00:10.562 --> 00:13.461
Um, so I'm not cooking tonight.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.860
Okay. So we kind of always get the same order.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.800
We can never get tacos without a horchata,

00:20.801 --> 00:24.581
so we got one. I always tell lucky to just get one.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.000
I always end up drinking the majority.

00:27.001 --> 00:29.341
I get two every time she steals my drinks.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.000
You got two this time? Yeah, mine.

00:32.001 --> 00:33.241
I told you to just get one.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.441
Well, I got two.

00:34.442 --> 00:37.801
So excited. We always go to this tiny little Mexican place

00:37.802 --> 00:40.401
that kind of looks like you wouldn't walk into it,

00:40.402 --> 00:42.581
but it's so good. It's the best.

00:42.760 --> 00:45.580
Oh yeah, baby. Oh yeah.

00:47.080 --> 00:51.000
That's insane amount of salsa.

00:51.001 --> 00:54.321
How many people do you think that they think that are gonna be eating?

00:54.322 --> 00:56.161
Probably a lot. We've got cilantro,

00:56.162 --> 00:59.361
limes and onions. We always need extra.

00:59.362 --> 01:01.381
I don't know why this is cautionary.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.260
Lucky uses so much lime, it's disgusting.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.860
And hot sauce. So you don't taste your food?

01:09.280 --> 01:12.540
No, I enhance my food with hot sauce.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.160
Oh yeah.

01:13.161 --> 01:14.721
My two tacos that I wanted to try.

01:14.722 --> 01:16.341
What is this? Chorizo.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.160
You've never gotten a chorizo taco before?

01:19.161 --> 01:21.721
Never in my life. He's branching out.

01:21.722 --> 01:22.961
Okay, this is what I got.

01:22.962 --> 01:24.861
What is this? The pork?

01:25.240 --> 01:26.840
Pork al pastor, I think.

01:26.841 --> 01:28.201
Yeah. Yeah.

01:28.202 --> 01:32.201
Tacos with just corn. I usually get Corn tortillas.

01:32.202 --> 01:36.041
I don't do flour for obvious reasons.

01:36.042 --> 01:38.221
You've got two trees of tacos.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.400
Never had a trees of taco,

01:39.401 --> 01:41.721
but you wanna see here. You wanna bite?

01:41.722 --> 01:42.621
Take a bite.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.020
You're unhinged today.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.140
And then I got

01:48.400 --> 01:51.640
steak tacos. Classic. Onion, cilantro,

01:51.641 --> 01:52.581
corn tortilla.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.680
Ever since I've known lucky,

01:54.681 --> 01:56.801
he's only done steak tacos.

01:56.802 --> 01:58.681
I remember when I first moved to LA,

01:58.682 --> 02:02.681
he would take his little skateboard and go skateboarding to get tacos

02:02.682 --> 02:03.821
at, like 1:00am.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.500
He gets salt on the side.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.600
So basically, lucky puts extra lime,

02:08.601 --> 02:10.441
extra hot sauce, all the sauces,

02:10.442 --> 02:12.861
extra salt on his tacos.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.260
That seems criminal. That's actually.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.620
Are you okay? I'm fully.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.840
I actually wonder if I am.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.241
I don't know. I like the green one,

02:23.242 --> 02:25.721
whatever this one is. This one's really spicy.

02:25.722 --> 02:27.001
This one is kinda more lemony,

02:27.002 --> 02:30.121
I guess. Have you guys watched the Martha documentary?

02:30.122 --> 02:31.921
I'm obsessed. She's so classic.

02:31.922 --> 02:34.841
I made lucky watch it, but he didn't get fully into it.

02:34.842 --> 02:35.981
He watched the first. No,

02:36.280 --> 02:37.720
I did, but I saw what I need.

02:37.721 --> 02:39.141
What I needed to see.

02:39.200 --> 02:43.020
And then I was kind of done seeing people build stuff,

02:43.080 --> 02:44.720
how they got from here to there.

02:44.721 --> 02:46.821
I like the whole thing. It was classic.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.840
Anyways, we're gonna go eat now.

02:48.841 --> 02:53.181
Yeah, we are. Eat a few tacos tonight.
