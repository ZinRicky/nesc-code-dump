My sister's in town to visit and she's been craving bubblegum so bad,

00:04.201 --> 00:07.321
but she ran out so I just decided to make it for her.

00:07.322 --> 00:11.401
I poured some powdered sugar on some wax paper and created a well

00:11.402 --> 00:14.041
before combining my gum base with some corn syrup

00:14.042 --> 00:15.921
and slowly melting it down.

00:15.922 --> 00:16.921
That was all melted.

00:16.922 --> 00:18.081
I gave it a good stir

00:18.082 --> 00:21.921
and poured it into my little powdered sugar wells I created.

00:21.922 --> 00:24.201
One of her favourite flavours is green apple,

00:24.202 --> 00:25.641
so I made a green apple one

00:25.642 --> 00:29.941
and then also experimented with making a cinnamon vanilla gum.

00:30.040 --> 00:32.440
Once the mixture was cold enough to handle,

00:32.441 --> 00:34.921
I kneaded it and then stretched it out

00:34.922 --> 00:37.881
and made sure to always have it covered in the powdered sugar

00:37.882 --> 00:39.261
so it wouldn't stick.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.640
Then I rolled out my gum,

00:40.641 --> 00:45.141
cut it into equal pieces and decided to go for a little gumball.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.840
Once all the green apple ones were formed,

00:46.841 --> 00:49.041
I moved on to my cinnamon vanilla ones

00:49.042 --> 00:52.981
and set them aside before tossing them in some more powdered sugar

00:53.000 --> 00:53.920
to keep them fresh.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.201
I placed them in some wax paper,

00:56.202 --> 00:57.361
twisted the sides

00:57.362 --> 00:59.881
and repeated that process with all of them

00:59.882 --> 01:01.801
and then they were ready to try.

01:01.802 --> 01:05.801
These tasted even better than store bought gum and she was so excited.

01:05.802 --> 01:08.541
The cinnamon vanilla ones tasted like a donut.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.939
I was very pleased about
