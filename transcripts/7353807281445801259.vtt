00:00.200 --> 00:02.320
Here's one of the things from the quiet on the set documentary

00:02.321 --> 00:03.601
that I found super weird.

00:03.602 --> 00:04.281
In episode two,

00:04.282 --> 00:06.161
we hear from child actor Kyle Sullivan,

00:06.162 --> 00:07.481
and he tells us about the time

00:07.482 --> 00:10.481
that he went over to Brian Peck's house for a barbecue.

00:10.482 --> 00:12.841
He says his house was just really weird.

00:12.842 --> 00:16.341
Apparently, there was this whole room dedicated to planet of the apes.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.800
He was walking through it, and he noticed something that didn't belong.

00:18.801 --> 00:21.721
It was a picture or a painting of a clown.

00:21.722 --> 00:22.841
So Kyle notices this,

00:22.842 --> 00:24.521
and Brian Peck is apparently really,

00:24.522 --> 00:26.401
really excited to tell him all about the painting.

00:26.402 --> 00:28.601
He tells him it isn't just any normal painting.

00:28.602 --> 00:32.681
It's actually from the well known serial killer, John Wayne Gacy.

00:32.682 --> 00:33.561
He painted it.

00:33.562 --> 00:35.121
He sent it to Brian Peck.

00:35.122 --> 00:38.581
In fact, Brian Peck is one of John Wayne Gacy's pen pals,

00:39.520 --> 00:40.920
and he has tons of letters from him

00:40.921 --> 00:43.001
that he keeps in the drawer of his bedside table.

00:43.002 --> 00:46.521
So this guy who works with children for a living

00:46.522 --> 00:50.181
is going back and forth with John Wayne Gacy?

00:50.200 --> 00:51.640
I have so many questions.

00:51.641 --> 00:53.201
Let's set aside the fact that Brian Peck

00:53.202 --> 00:54.921
only got about 16 months in jail

00:54.922 --> 00:55.721
for what he did,

00:55.722 --> 00:58.801
and then was let out and was allowed to work with children again.

00:58.802 --> 01:00.121
Let's just. Let's set that aside.

01:00.122 --> 01:04.041
Why. Why are we letting these horrible people have pen pals?

01:04.042 --> 01:04.921
So I looked into it,

01:04.922 --> 01:07.361
and it turns out that John Wayne Gacy had a ton of pen pals.

01:07.362 --> 01:10.161
It turns out that lots of serial killers have pen pals

01:10.162 --> 01:13.081
and they draw and they make art and they write books.

01:13.082 --> 01:14.201
These mass murderers

01:14.202 --> 01:17.641
who made it so several people don't even get to live anymore.

01:17.642 --> 01:20.081
They are given art supplies and pens

01:20.082 --> 01:22.761
and allowed to have hobbies and communicate with all kinds of people.

01:22.762 --> 01:24.501
So, again, I just have to ask, why?

01:24.520 --> 01:25.680
If you mass murder people,

01:25.681 --> 01:27.801
I'm sorry, you don't get to do art anymore.

01:27.802 --> 01:31.281
You don't get to go write thousands of people and have pen pals.

01:31.282 --> 01:32.081
It's ridiculous.

01:32.082 --> 01:33.161
And like I said before,

01:33.162 --> 01:34.641
if we were a serious society,

01:34.642 --> 01:38.067
we would be serious about how we punish people who hurt children.
