Hi guys Victoria lit here

00:07.801 --> 00:09.321
Modern day TRAD wife

00:09.322 --> 00:11.281
it's recently come to my attention

00:11.282 --> 00:15.481
that not everybody knows the difference between a sundress

00:15.482 --> 00:16.841
and a milk maid dress

00:16.842 --> 00:19.101
I pulled out some of my dresses

00:19.160 --> 00:22.240
to show you, explain what a sundress is vs milkmaid 

00:22.241 --> 00:25.421
I love wearing dresses so I have a couple here

00:25.480 --> 00:27.380
here is a sundress

00:28.080 --> 00:30.340
it does show a little bit more here

00:30.520 --> 00:31.880
so it's not as modest

00:31.881 --> 00:33.781
this is a sundress

00:34.080 --> 00:36.860
yellow, flowy, strappy

00:37.560 --> 00:38.640
great sundress

00:38.641 --> 00:40.801
here is another sundress

00:40.802 --> 00:43.301
flowy at the bottom, straps

00:43.680 --> 00:45.320
this is a sundress

00:45.321 --> 00:46.661
another option

00:47.480 --> 00:48.960
this is a sundress

00:48.961 --> 00:53.561
the flowy at the bottom has an open back, sundress

00:53.562 --> 00:55.801
I would say this is a sundress

00:55.802 --> 00:59.761
But more of like a milk made inspired dress though

00:59.762 --> 01:03.861
this is also another milk made dress

01:03.880 --> 01:05.680
see it kind of like cinches at the waist

01:05.681 --> 01:06.981
loose and flowy

01:07.080 --> 01:09.220
kind of more of a modest top

01:09.680 --> 01:10.700
love that

01:11.280 --> 01:13.960
and this is another milk maid dress

01:13.961 --> 01:14.961
longer version

01:14.962 --> 01:19.301
more modest love that it has a little slit on the side here

01:19.480 --> 01:21.620
but this is a milk maid dress

01:21.621 --> 01:22.978
those are the differences
