00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.740
all choosing the bear

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.240
this is because bears are predictable

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:09.141
and will only really be violent if they perceive you as a threat

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.200
this is because if you get mauled by a bear

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:16.621
no one is gonna ask you what you are wearing or why you were there

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.140
or if you were drunk

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.340
I wish I could say the same for men

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.920
we call upon our government

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:33.261
our communities our society and every individual to take a stand

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.160
and I thank you all for coming here today to do just that

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:39.321
and I thank the men as well who came here today

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.301
it's not a popular choice

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.400
it's not popular in this country to do that

00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:50.721
it should be but it's not

00:00:50.722 --> 00:00:53.481
and we need them um to stand with us

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:56.981
we need them to join this movement and this fight

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.140
we need everyone to stand up on this issue

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.600
and we need preventative measures

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.301
not just reactive responses

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.960
we demand policies and programmes that educate and reform

00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:17.781
that dismantle the structures that enable this violence

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.320
Australia is actually

00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:23.001
doing some of the most groundbreaking research on men's violence against women

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:24.721
and we are a leader in the world

00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:27.801
so we know what to do these people you've all have

00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:32.821
you've heard from today they are experts and their organisations know what to do
