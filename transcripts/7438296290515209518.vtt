00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.520
I made it. I survived a sleepover with like 9,

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:08.481
9 year olds. You can tell by my face,

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:11.161
I am absolutely exhausted.

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:13.241
Some of the girls, including my daughter,

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:16.361
the birthday girl, stayed up until like 2 or 3 in the morning

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:18.081
no matter what I tried to do,

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:19.321
tried to get them to sleep

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.161
like every 30 minutes. I could hear them.

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.081
They were loud, but it was like,

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:25.001
it's girl head. They wanted to stay up all night

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.281
and chat and giggle with their friends.

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:27.681
So like, what are you gonna do?

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.681
It's kind of like the point of a slumber party.

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:34.121
So today is a down day. Today is I'm doing Nothing Day.

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:36.281
I'm not even like, really cleaning up from the party.

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:38.721
Everything that needs to be done can be done tomorrow.

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:40.961
It's not gonna be a big deal if we just leave it.

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:42.801
But it was so cute and so magical.

00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:43.881
I'm gonna post like,

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:47.281
the party prep and the theme and all that stuff in the decorations,

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:49.041
cause it was. It was so great.

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:50.661
My daughter had such a good time.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.540
This was definitely a core memory birthday.
