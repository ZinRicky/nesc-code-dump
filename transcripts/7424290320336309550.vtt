00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.120
this is a great question let's talk about it

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:03.880
an abortion is a termination of a pregnancy

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:06.960
and this may need to be done for a wide range of reasons

00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:10.520
an abortion may be necessary to complete an otherwise incomplete miscarriage

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:13.080
or an individual may have pre existing conditions

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:16.740
or just generally have conditions that are being exacerbated by their pregnancy

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.560
and they need to terminate their pregnancy

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.720
a person may need to terminate their pregnancy

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.040
so that they can receive things like cancer treatment

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:26.880
the pregnant individual may be a child whose body is literally too small

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.240
but they face significant added health risks

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.240
if they are forced to continue the pregnancy

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:32.280
those are just a few examples

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:36.120
but it's really important to note that all abortions are medically necessary

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.720
because we know that it is incredibly dangerous

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:41.200
to force people to continue their pregnancies

00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:45.160
against their will it is not just some minor inconvenience to a person

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:48.800
pregnancy is incredibly dangerous and could cost them their life

00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:50.800
their health their reproductive organs

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.600
and in no other area of this country

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:56.040
do we force people to sacrifice themselves or their organs

00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:57.280
for any other person's life

00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:01.520
so we don't force people or even dead people to give their organs

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:04.600
despite all the people dying waiting on the organ donor list

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:06.300
and we don't force people to give blood

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.880
so yeah

00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:07.840
there you have it um

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:10.241
I hope this was helpful and let me know if you have any other questions
