People will not stop talking about the NYX

00:02.360 --> 00:03.840
Fat Lip Drip Oil,

00:03.840 --> 00:05.440
and so I had to try it out today.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.560
It was 8 99,

00:06.560 --> 00:08.520
and it is in the shade supermodel.

00:08.520 --> 00:09.480
Is it just like a lip gloss?

00:09.480 --> 00:10.580
Like, I don't know.

00:10.680 --> 00:11.680
Let's test it out.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.060
I usually don't go for super pink shades,

00:14.960 --> 00:16.540
but I thought maybe I'll try it,

00:21.240 --> 00:22.040
and then,

00:27.480 --> 00:28.280
uh.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.480
I don't really love it.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.040
I don't feel like it's worth 8 99.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.180
I just feel like it's kind of sticky,

00:37.200 --> 00:38.240
not super shiny.

00:38.240 --> 00:41.000
Have a two dollar lip gloss that is way shinier

00:41.000 --> 00:42.200
and looks better.

00:42.200 --> 00:42.720
I don't know.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.020
I wanna take it off.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.640
Dang it. I wanted to love it.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.760
I was so excited.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.200
Why do people hype this up?

00:48.200 --> 00:49.320
Am I missing something?

00:49.320 --> 00:50.500
Did I do it wrong?

00:50.560 --> 00:52.040
Um, let me know.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.000
But until. Till I figure it out,

00:54.000 --> 00:55.519
it's a no go for me.
