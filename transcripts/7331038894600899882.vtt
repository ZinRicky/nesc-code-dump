00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.500
I know you're scared

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.560
scared to start over from day one

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:05.720
scared that the age gap might be too big

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:07.480
scared that your kids might not get along

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:10.000
or that they won't have any shared experiences

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.140
these were all on my mind when I decided to have a third kid

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.040
my older two were 5 and 6

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:17.920
and we were really starting back at the baby stage from day one

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:21.280
and the thing that has really warmed my heart this entire time

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:24.860
is how seamless our third child has fit into our family

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.680
not only has our youngest grown to meet the big kids

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.660
and play with them in their own spheres

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.880
our older kids get down on his level too

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:34.840
so they can share these beautiful playtime experiences

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:36.480
honestly my oldest two are like twins

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:38.800
and I was really worried about upsetting that dynamic

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:40.780
but it is only brought them closer

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.240
and I know family dynamics

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.960
completely depend on the personalities of the kids that you get

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.040
and there is absolutely no planning for that

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.920
but I not only have had a wonderful time

00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:52.260
watching these three siblings get to know each other and love each other

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.000
I have had a wonderful time as a parent

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:56.840
getting to start over from day one

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:58.400
because I am such a calmer

00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.400
more patient

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:02.000
more educated parent than I was the first time around

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.640
I've been through the toddler stage

00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:05.520
I know which typical behaviour

00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.200
I don't sweat the small stuff

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.220
as much as I did the first time around

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.520
our third gets the benefit of

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:12.840
not just being looked after by two exhausted parents

00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:15.640
but two doting and energetic siblings as well

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.760
can't imagine our life without our third child

00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:19.680
because this kid is surrounded by love

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:21.680
he is definitely in the winter circle

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.940
and I personally love the big age gap
