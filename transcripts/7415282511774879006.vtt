00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.360
Fill in the blank. Ban X.

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:06.881
Not books. Ban automatic assault rifles in schools

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:10.341
instead of critical race theory and intersectionality in schools.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.760
Ban dehumanization. Ban fascism.

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.121
Ban racism. Ban anti blackness,

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:18.841
anti immigrant, anti woman.

00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:21.821
Not books. Ban the erasure of history.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.800
Not books. One of the most important things we can do right now

00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.081
is really come to terms with our history in this country.

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:31.921
What is literally lodged on genocide,

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:35.121
it's lodged on fascism, whether it was indigenous,

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:36.601
whether it was African Americans

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:40.781
and what happened. We have to uproot that and be free of it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.560
if we're gonna have a real future.

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:45.361
I don't spend a lot of time thinking about what to ban anything.

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:47.561
I'm just trying to see what I would love to create

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:50.621
and to create more space for,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.060
rather than trying to police or dictate

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.380
who should or shouldn't be doing bad acts.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.560
Formerly known as we're good.

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.041
We don't need it controlled by algorithms

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.701
which are controlled by a narcissistic multi billionaire.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.060
I don't think we're gonna get anything good out of that rotten apple.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.780
Ban keeping Black History Month only in February.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.780
And talk about all histories all the time.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.140
Not books. Ban corporate money and politics.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.080
The federal election system is very deeply broken

00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:27.761
as a result of a lot of factors,

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:29.241
including a Supreme Court case

00:01:29.242 --> 00:01:31.321
that made it so that these corporations

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:34.821
can spend unlimited money in our elections

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.460
and subvert our democratic processes.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.520
And so, yeah,

00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:39.821
We gotta get money out of politics.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.380
Ban the disconnection from the power of the word.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.640
Because words are sacred. We are spell casting at every single moment.

00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:54.401
I when we remember our intrinsic relationship with the earth,

00:01:54.402 --> 00:01:59.081
we remember that the trees gave us everything we are now.

00:01:59.082 --> 00:02:04.021
There are ancient elders. How dare we ban a book
