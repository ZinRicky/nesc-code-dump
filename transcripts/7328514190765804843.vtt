This morning,

00:00.600 --> 00:02.640
I asked my toddlers what they wanted for breakfast,

00:02.640 --> 00:04.000
and they both said cereal.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.240
So cereal it was.

00:05.240 --> 00:06.680
And we got started right away.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.160
I made two types of cereal.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.000
The first one was chocolate chip cookie cereal.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.800
So I mix some flour,

00:12.800 --> 00:13.440
peanut butter,

00:13.440 --> 00:14.320
maple syrup,

00:14.320 --> 00:15.440
milk and chocolate

00:15.440 --> 00:17.060
and form that into a dough.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.360
Then I rolled tiny little balls

00:19.360 --> 00:22.520
and flattened them out to resemble little cookies.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.480
I put all of them on a baking sheet

00:24.480 --> 00:27.140
and then pop that in the oven for about

00:27.200 --> 00:29.100
10 to 13 minutes.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.120
Pulled that out

00:30.120 --> 00:31.320
and let that cool

00:31.320 --> 00:33.980
while I started on my second type of cereal.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.280
The cereal was a Cocoa Puffs cereal.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.720
So I did oat flour,

00:37.720 --> 00:38.480
maple syrup,

00:38.480 --> 00:39.320
cocoa powder,

00:39.320 --> 00:40.460
some nut butter,

00:40.600 --> 00:42.340
and gave that a really good mix.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.920
Then I form that into a ball,

00:44.920 --> 00:46.200
cut that in four pieces,

00:46.200 --> 00:48.560
and then started assembling my small

00:48.560 --> 00:49.920
little Cocoa Puff balls.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.360
I didn't wanna flatten these out,

00:51.360 --> 00:53.800
so I just laid them on the baking sheet like this

00:53.800 --> 00:57.200
and put those in the oven as well for about 10 minutes.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.120
Once those were done,

00:58.120 --> 00:59.600
I let those cool as well,

00:59.600 --> 01:02.040
and then assembled my little bowl of cereal

01:02.040 --> 01:03.160
with my Cocoa Puffs

01:03.160 --> 01:04.460
and my cookies,

01:04.680 --> 01:05.680
topped that with milk,

01:05.680 --> 01:06.874
and that's what they had for breakfast.
