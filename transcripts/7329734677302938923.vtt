00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.960
when I was married

00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:03.121
and I was trying to figure out if I should get a divorce or stay married

00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:03.761
or what should I do

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:04.641
we have four kids

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:06.221
one of them is disabled

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.600
I live thousands of miles away from family

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:09.841
like what the fuck am I gonna do

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:10.321
and I was like

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:12.881
really searching for answers to try to like

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.041
make it work and make it stay

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:15.361
somebody recommended this book

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:16.241
why does he do that

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:17.081
inside the minds

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:18.121
angry and controlling men

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:20.261
and I thought it was gonna give me the answers to like

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.320
figure out how I could work with him

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:23.801
how can I just like

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:25.041
be the right partner

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:26.201
maybe you know

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:28.401
I just need to learn how to work around him

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:29.921
you know he's the man of the family

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:31.921
and I'm his wife and his supporter

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:33.301
and it's my job to like

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.860
kinda work around him

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.480
and then I read this book

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:40.501
and realized there's no fucking excuse for that kind of behaviour

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.040
and this book is fucking wild

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.241
because the dude who wrote it

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.501
Lendy Bancroft

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.840
he spent years and years and years

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:48.201
like 20 years or some shit

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:51.581
working with domestic violence criminals

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.160
helping rehabilitate them

00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:55.941
and they all knew exactly what the fuck they're doing

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.600
you know how like

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:57.561
when you talk to your friends and

00:00:57.562 --> 00:00:58.281
like other women

00:00:58.282 --> 00:00:59.121
you hear their stories

00:00:59.122 --> 00:00:59.961
and you're like wow

00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:01.601
were we dating the same guy

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:03.321
like was they know what they're doing

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:04.761
they know what the fuck they're doing

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:07.621
they absolutely know what the fuck they're doing

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.320
and one thing I always used to say was

00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:11.161
oh I know he doesn't mean it maliciously

00:01:11.162 --> 00:01:12.201
like I've he just

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:13.241
he just had a long day

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:14.661
he's just really tired

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.440
you know stress is really getting to him

00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:19.641
the fact that doesn't give you a right or a reason

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:23.121
to take that anger and frustration out on the people closest to you

00:01:23.122 --> 00:01:25.121
if anything they are your comfort zone

00:01:25.122 --> 00:01:28.541
they are the people that you can fall into at the end of the day

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.880
as a release from all that stress

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:32.601
they're not the person you take it out on

00:01:32.602 --> 00:01:35.821
that's not the way a relationship should work

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.560
so if you've never read this book

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:38.601
I highly recommend it

00:01:38.602 --> 00:01:40.481
if you don't can't buy the book

00:01:40.482 --> 00:01:41.361
you can Google this

00:01:41.362 --> 00:01:43.961
there are PDF versions available online everywhere

00:01:43.962 --> 00:01:44.881
this author just

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:50.301
truly was fucking horrified at what he heard these criminals saying

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.680
and he wanted to make sure that people never fucking suffer like that again

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.991
so you should read it
