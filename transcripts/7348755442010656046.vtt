00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.840
Does anyone deal with grief like this, or is it just me?

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:06.661
I just recently lost someone really close to me, and I have some.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.780
Some grief from trying to work through.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.340
I guess this is how I'm handling it.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.300
Life's too short not to buy these for to lose.
