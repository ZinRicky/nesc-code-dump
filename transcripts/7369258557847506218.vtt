Harrison Bucker giving his speech

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.420
for the ladies present today.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.300
Congratulations on an amazing accomplishment.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.200
You should be proud of all that you have achieved

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.341
to this point in your young lives.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.000
I want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you,

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.501
the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.860
How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.320
and are thinking about all the promotions and titles

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:29.981
you are going to get in your career?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.120
Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world.

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:36.801
But I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:37.841
about your marriage

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:40.181
and the children you will bring into this world.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.740
I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.880
would be the first to say that her life truly started

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:49.741
when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.380
I'm on the stage today unable to be the man I am

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.060
because I have a wife who leans into her location.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.680
I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me.

00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:06.061
But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.860
because a girl I met in band class back in middle school would

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.100
convert to the faith,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.940
become my wife,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.340
and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Homemaker.
