00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
I couldn't stop thinking about strawberry mochi ice cream

00:03.121 --> 00:05.801
since I finished my last batch a few days ago

00:05.802 --> 00:08.641
and since it's summer and berries are so good right now,

00:08.642 --> 00:11.121
I decided to take full advantage of that.

00:11.122 --> 00:13.081
Started by chopping up my strawberries

00:13.082 --> 00:14.921
and letting them sit with some sugar

00:14.922 --> 00:17.461
while I got started on my ice cream base.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.800
Combine some milk, heavy cream, vanilla,

00:19.801 --> 00:22.581
some sugar and gave that a really good mix.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.760
I set that aside,

00:23.761 --> 00:27.841
blended up my strawberries and then combined that with my milk mixture.

00:27.842 --> 00:29.601
Once that was all incorporated,

00:29.602 --> 00:31.841
I chilled that for about an hour

00:31.842 --> 00:34.201
before pouring it into my ice cream Turner

00:34.202 --> 00:37.521
and letting it turn for about 20 to 25 minutes.

00:37.522 --> 00:39.581
Once it reached soft serve consistency,

00:39.720 --> 00:41.360
I spooned it into my tray,

00:41.361 --> 00:44.121
pop that in the freezer for about four hours.

00:44.122 --> 00:45.881
Once it was completely frozen,

00:45.882 --> 00:50.241
I scoop tiny little balls onto this baking tray and let those freeze

00:50.242 --> 00:52.861
while I got started on making my mochi dough.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.760
Combine some glutinous rice flour, cornstarch,

00:55.761 --> 00:58.001
some powdered sugar, and some water.

00:58.002 --> 00:59.641
I wanted my mochi to be pink

00:59.642 --> 01:02.881
so I added some pink color to it before heating it up

01:02.882 --> 01:04.441
and once it came together

01:04.442 --> 01:07.881
I rolled it out and then took a cookie cutter to get perfect

01:07.882 --> 01:10.621
round circles to spoon my ice cream into.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.360
Pulled my ice cream out of the freezer

01:12.361 --> 01:14.561
and batches so that it wouldn't melt.

01:14.562 --> 01:18.321
Placed my tiny scoops inside the mochi and then Wrapped it all around.

01:18.322 --> 01:19.961
The ones I was eating immediately,

01:19.962 --> 01:23.761
I put on a plate while the others went back into the freezer.

01:23.762 --> 01:26.901
This was absolutely divine and hit the spot.
