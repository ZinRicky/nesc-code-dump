00:00.400 --> 00:04.700
I am going to show you what my day looked like today.

00:05.720 --> 00:12.380
I wake up Nurse Lord Joe. Then we get the kids fed and ready for school,

00:12.400 --> 00:16.060
which is in a little schoolhouse we have here on the farm.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.000
We have a school teacher come in,

00:18.001 --> 00:22.221
and it's a one room school room with the older kids,

00:22.320 --> 00:24.200
and they love it. We love our teacher.

00:24.201 --> 00:25.541
It works really well.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.340
During school, I usually try to get a little workout in.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.660
Then we get dressed, do our morning chores,

00:33.600 --> 00:35.660
try to get some protein in.

00:35.920 --> 00:41.400
Then today I decided to make some soup and film it.

00:41.401 --> 00:47.181
So I set my tripod up and we just documented gathering food,

00:47.280 --> 00:51.320
making food. And after the kids go to bed is when I typically edit.

00:51.321 --> 00:55.581
And then after that, we packed everything up for kids practices.

00:55.800 --> 00:59.260
So Daniel took the girls, I took the boys.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.800
We got everyone loaded up and in the truck as soon as we made it there.

01:04.801 --> 01:06.481
Of course, the girls were starving,

01:06.482 --> 01:09.161
so we nursed, we Cheerios,

01:09.162 --> 01:10.461
we drink milk.

01:11.200 --> 01:14.680
Then we. We were reunited with the girls and Daniel

01:14.681 --> 01:18.541
and enjoyed the most beautiful sunset I've seen in a long time.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.340
And watch the kiddos play.
