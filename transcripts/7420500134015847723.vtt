00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.640
This week,

00:00:00.641 --> 00:00:02.881
Matt and I took the kids to one of our favorite local restaurants

00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:05.841
for dinner. Bone by me is a local Charleston institution

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:08.721
and just opened their newest location in the Oakland Shopping Center

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:11.121
in Mount Pleasant. And we hadn't gone to check them out yet

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:13.121
and we knew they had some incredible specials.

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:14.361
I love that they have a kids menu

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:16.821
that lets kids be in control of what they eat on their plate.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.360
Selections of meats, sides,

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:21.321
and additions. We decided to get a couple appetizers for the table

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:23.081
before jumping into the main dishes.

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:25.521
The Brussels sprouts and cauliflower were absolutely delicious,

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:28.841
and the shishito peppers with the garlic dipping sauce was divine.

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:31.241
The kids both ended up getting ground pork tacos

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:32.761
and absolutely loved them.

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:33.641
My favorite, though,

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.161
were these stir fried udon noodles,

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:37.901
which are only at this Northmount Pleasant location,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.160
along with the duck FA.

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:41.921
These were definitely dishes that were worth the drive over for.

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:43.681
And of course, we had to share the duck fried rice

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:45.841
because the entire family is obsessed with it.

00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:48.841
I love being able to get really high quality food in a casual setting.

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:51.801
It makes weekday dinners with the kids so much easier.

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.601
Bone by me is a regular takeout spot for us,

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:54.121
but now I know

00:00:54.122 --> 00:00:55.281
I'm gonna have to go to Northmount Pleasant

00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:58.121
to get those stir fried noodles again. Go check them out soon!
