00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.040
so I've been thinking about the 4B movement

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.280
sorry my cat is here

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:06.000
right by my face um

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:10.960
I'm thinking about the 4B movement and how our generation um

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:13.520
or maybe this is just like America in general and like

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:16.000
our anti intellectualism um

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.560
we are like obsessed with hard and fast rules to things

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:24.080
which I think is a symptom of our lack of critical thinking skills in America

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:24.960
and the fact that like

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:26.660
we are just very much taught

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.800
that you have to just do what someone else tells you

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.520
I feel like the left really suffers from this

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:36.360
even though it is a side effect of like

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:39.640
growing up in a right wing authoritarian country

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.520
so with the 4B movement specifically

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.440
and this is far from the only place where this shows up

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:47.100
because I think that it popped up with election discourse a lot

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.780
but with the 4B movement

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.280
it's just interesting that feminists have been saying for years and years now

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:53.920
that like

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:55.740
women need to decenter men

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.140
you need to like

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.080
you know disengage from like

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:01.760
all the heterosexual patriarchal like propaganda

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.240
like all of this

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:07.880
and then obviously it didn't catch on too much

00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:09.560
I mean there has been an increase in like

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:12.320
women being independent from men um

00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:13.160
but now like

00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:14.960
everyone's talking about the 4B movement

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.440
and like there are a lot of criticisms

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:19.740
completely valid criticisms coming of it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.560
like I think if we actually could get a considerable percentage

00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:30.120
of women in America on board with having a strict boycott of not dating

00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:31.920
not having sex with men not getting married

00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:33.320
not having children like

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:36.280
I think that would be we would see results

00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:39.360
but so many women are going to keep dating and keep sleeping with men

00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:40.700
and they're going to like

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.520
say like oh

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:45.000
like I stand in solidarity with the feminists and the 4B movement

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.480
but like I found a good one

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:50.040
like my man is the exception and there are good men in the world

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:51.920
might be controversial to

00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:54.880
to hear from someone who is a very far left like feminist

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:59.300
but I don't believe that men are 100% inherently evil

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.360
um I think that actually like

00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:03.720
kind of feeds into bio essentialism a little bit

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:05.640
though that might be a TikTok for another time

00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:08.980
is that why they say the 4B movement in Korea is terfy

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.480
I actually had no idea why people say that

00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:14.640
it's like full of terfs but is that it

00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:17.760
is it because of the bio essentialism of it anyway

00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:19.920
how come that when we say decenter men

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:24.080
it's not very effective but then you talk about the 4B movement

00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:28.860
just launching a very strict boycott of all things heterosexual and patriarchal

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.371
then all of a sudden people are really interested
