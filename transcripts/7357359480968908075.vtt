00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.120
I get this question all the time.

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:05.761
I literally saw a woman in Costco waiting for her hot dog

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:06.241
and I was like,

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:07.401
where did you get that sweater?

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:08.841
It looks so snuggly and amazing.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:12.681
And it is. Here's the thing I bought.

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:15.181
That woman told me the same thing when I asked her.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.200
It's from a tiny Little Fucking Farm store in the west called Murdochs.

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:23.421
M U R D O C H S Murdochs.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.360
And the name of the sweater brand is Wanna Comi?

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.901
They're in Canada.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.840
It's really fucking.

00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:33.841
I don't. My boyfriend got me this sweater

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:37.361
because the little farm store website is always down.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:39.001
They're always having a problem with shipping.

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.981
It's just a really shitty website.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.640
So, like, when it's working, you can order the sweater just fine.

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:45.461
There's also a hooded version that I want.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.720
This brand, the Canadian brand,

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.041
they also have like a shitty website and you can like.

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:52.401
It doesn't ship to everywhere.

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:54.001
So that is

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.861
all the information on this sweater that people always ask me about.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.080
It is as comfortable and snuggly as you want.

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:01.181
It does get a little chokey though.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.240
Also, it.

00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:04.721
The only thing that sucks about it is you can only wear it like that.

00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:05.541
Like, you can't.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.940
It's kind of.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.160
I don't know. You know what I mean?

00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:10.681
Like, when it's not all snuggled up,

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:13.161
it's kind of not the most easy to wear,

00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:13.921
but it is snuggly,

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:15.079
so hope that helps.
