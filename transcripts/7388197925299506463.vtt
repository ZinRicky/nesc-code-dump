00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
Here you go, girly pop.

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:04.481
The link is right here. This little orange thing.

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:06.301
It should say African net sponge.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.320
Click it. Buy one

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:08.761
if you don't want your loofahs

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:11.841
to start growing vegetables out of them

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:13.801
like traditional luffas can do.

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:16.761
The African nut sponge. You can open it up,

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:19.721
rinse it out. You can even machine wash it,

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:20.601
and it lasts, I think,

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:23.841
up to two years. Up to two years.

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:25.121
And it's machine washable.

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:28.701
And just in between, you can actually rinse it out yourself.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.375
Linked right here. It's amazing and I love it.
