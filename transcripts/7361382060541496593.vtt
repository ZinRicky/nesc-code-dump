00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
When which feminism began

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.820
was by calling it to question received notions of what a woman is,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.240
right? They tell you you belong in the household.

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.521
They tell you you're good for reproduction.

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:16.881
They tell you you're not able to do that kind of work.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.321
You can't engage in sports.

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:20.921
You can't be a public speaker.

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:22.481
You certainly can't be a politician.

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:24.121
You can't be an intellectual.

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:26.521
Or if you are, you're never gonna be quite as good.

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:28.641
So what has feminism been about?

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:32.961
It's been about contesting received ideas of what a woman is.

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:36.701
Why did we start women studies,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.040
feminist studies, gender studies?

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:40.121
Well, we did

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:41.921
because we wanted to call into question

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:47.001
these presuppositions that had been taken for granted for too long.

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.321
So we ask the question, what is it to be a woman

00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:52.261
or what does it mean to be a woman?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Smoked above wire, one is not born but rather becomes a woman.

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.021
Really? It's not biologically,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.720
it's not the biological function that makes you a woman?

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:04.361
No, it's not the biological function.

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:08.081
It's actually nothing specific about the biology

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:11.501
that alone defines you as a woman.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.680
It's part of the picture. But how you live that,

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.801
why you do with that is a question of history.

00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:20.241
It's a question of freedom.

00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:23.021
It's how you negotiate your situation,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.220
which is an historically complicated one

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.420
where there established norms and roles.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.720
So feminism has always kept the question open,

00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:35.261
what is a woman? And refused To answer it,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.600
refuse to answer it on principle

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:40.721
because we don't know all the things women can be and do.

00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:42.701
And we're not about to say in advance,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.720
this is who you are, stay within your limits,

00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:46.881
stay within this category.

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:50.561
We've decided this is what a woman is and you have to live there.

00:01:50.562 --> 00:01:51.721
No, we don't.

00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:54.501
We don't do that. We're, we're freedom struggle.
