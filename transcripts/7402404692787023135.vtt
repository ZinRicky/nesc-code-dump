Here's how I get the very most out of my Olaplex.

00:02.561 --> 00:03.761
This is for the number three,

00:03.762 --> 00:06.281
and this is something that a hairdresser told me not that long ago.

00:06.282 --> 00:09.081
Game changer. I start with slightly damp hair.

00:09.082 --> 00:11.721
I washed it with shampoo, but I did not use any conditioner.

00:11.722 --> 00:13.801
Section it a little bit. For the bottom parts,

00:13.802 --> 00:15.281
I'm not gonna use very much,

00:15.282 --> 00:16.901
like, literally that much.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.920
Then for these sections up here,

00:18.921 --> 00:21.661
I use a little bit more that much.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.640
Pretty saturated in the Olaplex.

00:27.641 --> 00:30.121
I'm going to take a butterfly clip,

00:30.122 --> 00:31.781
we're gonna clip it up,

00:32.560 --> 00:35.440
and I'm gonna use one of these plastic hair caps

00:35.441 --> 00:37.841
to really keep the moisture in there.

00:37.842 --> 00:41.621
So cute. Then I like to just put a scarf over all of it.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.400
I will go clean the house,

00:43.401 --> 00:44.961
homeschool the kids, laundry,

00:44.962 --> 00:48.041
get started on dinner. I will just let this sit several hours.

00:48.042 --> 00:50.321
The bottle says to let it sit for 10 minutes.

00:50.322 --> 00:53.281
I honestly think they're just trying to get you to buy more bottles,

00:53.282 --> 00:56.081
because it continues to work long after 10 minutes.

00:56.082 --> 00:57.761
As long as your hair is a little bit wet,

00:57.762 --> 01:00.281
it'll continue to work. At least that's what my hairdresser told me.

01:00.282 --> 01:01.481
So that's what I've been doing,

01:01.482 --> 01:03.721
and I love it. I've used this stuff for years,

01:03.722 --> 01:07.085
and this is hands down the best way to get the most bang for your bug.
