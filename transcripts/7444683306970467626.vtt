00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
We've moved six times in the past five years,

00:02.441 --> 00:04.561
and every move gets harder and harder

00:04.562 --> 00:06.681
because we have more things to take.

00:06.682 --> 00:09.681
I can't believe that I'm saying that this is our last move

00:09.682 --> 00:11.941
because we finally bought a house.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.320
One of the things I've always dreamt about was buying my own home,

00:15.321 --> 00:18.881
and I can't believe that 23 am in the position to do that.

00:18.882 --> 00:20.201
And I couldn't be more grateful

00:20.202 --> 00:22.281
for all of you guys that are following along

00:22.282 --> 00:23.861
this journey that I'm on.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.840
This household. So many memories.

00:25.841 --> 00:28.241
From the kitchen that I cook in every single day

00:28.242 --> 00:30.401
to our bedroom that whimsy was born in,

00:30.402 --> 00:31.881
or the kids rooms

00:31.882 --> 00:35.021
convincing them that monsters are not hiding in their closet.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.520
Even though I feel so emotional leaving this house,

00:37.521 --> 00:41.361
I'm so excited to be making new memories in the home that we bought

00:41.362 --> 00:43.161
all the way on the East Coast.

00:43.162 --> 00:46.841
So for the last time, we had to get some breakfast bagels at shugs.

00:46.842 --> 00:50.001
This is the place we first got bagels at when we move to Dallas,

00:50.002 --> 00:51.841
so it truly felt nostalgic.

00:51.842 --> 00:53.961
We got ourselves and the movers some breakfast

00:53.962 --> 00:55.441
and came back to our closet,

00:55.442 --> 00:56.401
packed up.

00:56.402 --> 00:59.601
The movers packed up the majority of our stuff on our first day,

00:59.602 --> 01:01.561
and when we woke up on the second,

01:01.562 --> 01:02.881
lucky got the kids ready,

01:02.882 --> 01:06.861
and I packed up the last little bits that I needed in my suitcase.

01:06.920 --> 01:10.680
Seeing the kitchen all packed up made It feel so much more real.

01:10.681 --> 01:12.641
After five more hours of packing,

01:12.642 --> 01:14.001
our whole house was empty.

01:14.002 --> 01:16.261
And it was time for us to say goodbye.

01:16.320 --> 01:19.200
So we spent the last little bit just looking at the house

01:19.201 --> 01:20.841
and everything that was built in it

01:20.842 --> 01:22.968
before embarking on our new adventure.
