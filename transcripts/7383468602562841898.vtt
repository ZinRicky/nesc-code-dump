00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
We're back in LA for the next two weeks

00:02.161 --> 00:04.401
after having lived here for three years,

00:04.402 --> 00:07.521
and in a way, everything feels so nostalgic to me.

00:07.522 --> 00:10.001
I tried to wake up before my older kids do,

00:10.002 --> 00:11.281
which doesn't always work,

00:11.282 --> 00:12.401
but today it did.

00:12.402 --> 00:16.581
So I got my skincare routine in and ran lucky shower for him,

00:16.600 --> 00:18.640
trying to get him to use sunscreen,

00:18.641 --> 00:20.601
so I apply it for him every morning,

00:20.602 --> 00:22.641
and this one has been my favorite one.

00:22.642 --> 00:25.121
You guys know I need my hot cup of tea,

00:25.122 --> 00:26.481
so I did that next.

00:26.482 --> 00:29.521
Lately, it's been peppermint tea with some lemon and honey.

00:29.522 --> 00:33.441
After that, I hopped on a quick meeting before getting my kids dressed.

00:33.442 --> 00:35.401
My parents already fed them some breakfast,

00:35.402 --> 00:37.121
so this is their second breakfast,

00:37.122 --> 00:38.921
but they wanted some banana bread,

00:38.922 --> 00:42.381
so I got started on making that by mashing up some bananas,

00:42.400 --> 00:45.880
adding all of my wet ingredients before adding my dry ingredients.

00:45.881 --> 00:48.461
And some chocolate I chopped up,

00:48.520 --> 00:49.600
gave that good mix,

00:49.601 --> 00:50.841
popped that in the oven

00:50.842 --> 00:53.161
before setting the kids up with some coloring stuff

00:53.162 --> 00:57.221
so lucky and I could unpack our bags and get our closet organized.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.560
Usually leave everything in suitcases,

00:59.561 --> 01:01.521
but since we're gonna be here for a second,

01:01.522 --> 01:03.801
I decided to just unpack it all.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.621
After we unpacked everything,

01:05.680 --> 01:07.680
I got started on doing my makeup.

01:07.681 --> 01:10.641
I need to do my makeup in order to feel productive.

01:10.642 --> 01:11.801
I don't know what it is,

01:11.802 --> 01:14.281
but I mastered my Makeup routine to where

01:14.282 --> 01:16.761
only takes me 15 minutes every morning.

01:16.762 --> 01:20.401
Also, my lip combo is the Cork lip liner from Mac,

01:20.402 --> 01:22.041
a beniflora from benefit,

01:22.042 --> 01:24.941
and then whatever lip gloss I can find.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.120
Know what to wear this morning?

01:26.121 --> 01:29.961
But I decided on this little romper situation at this point.

01:29.962 --> 01:31.561
The kids wanted to swim in the pool,

01:31.562 --> 01:32.881
so that's what they did

01:32.882 --> 01:36.281
while I went back inside and pulled out my banana bread.

01:36.282 --> 01:38.041
I sliced them up a couple slices

01:38.042 --> 01:41.761
and also made them a little fruit plate I ended up eating.

01:41.762 --> 01:43.841
I'm trying my hardest to stay hydrated,

01:43.842 --> 01:46.921
so I always take my liquid IV wherever I go.

01:46.922 --> 01:50.201
They've come out with so many new flavors since I started using them,

01:50.202 --> 01:52.101
and I love having them on hand.
