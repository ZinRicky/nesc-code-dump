00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.840
Age gaps, age gaps,

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:03.121
age gap. I agree.

00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:04.241
This is a very nice comment.

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:07.881
She has a point. Most men don't wanna settle down before the age of 25.

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:10.641
She's saying that if women had men that wanted to settle down,

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:13.341
that we would probably consider having babies sooner.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.440
And yes, but again,

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:17.681
with our culture, we demonize age gaps between men and women,

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:19.641
which doesn't make sense because historically speaking,

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:21.521
we have always dated up.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:26.281
I got engaged at 20 and I don't know what I was thinking.

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:27.401
He was the same age as me,

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:28.801
in fact I was a few months older.

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:30.321
But like, maturity wise,

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:32.381
I was ready to have babies and settle down

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.140
and he wanted to do silly frat boy things.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.880
I hundred percent should have been dating someone when I was like 23.

00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:42.561
I should have been dating a 30 year old.

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:46.721
And my husband and I now have a 7 or 8 year age gap.

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:48.241
And yeah, it makes sense.

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:50.881
I met him when he was like 37,

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:54.641
so he for sure was not married for a reason before then.

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:56.441
Boys take a little bit of time.

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:59.441
But if you tell a 22 year old to date a 30 year old,

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:00.721
everyone thinks it's creepy.

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:01.721
Again, doesn't make sense.

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:03.081
That's when women are the most fertile,

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:04.161
that's when they're the youngest,

00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:07.841
that's when they're the most youthful and pretty to men biologically.

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:09.681
Now, I'm a huge proponent of like,

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:12.081
thriving in your 30s I feel like I hit my.

00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:16.441
My peak in my thirties. So I am not age shaming any girls,

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:17.681
but 100%

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:21.901
we should not be sending girls to college with the same age of boys

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.040
thinking that they're gonna be safe, protected,

00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:25.361
loved, cherished,

00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:27.481
or even find a husband. And unfortunately,

00:01:27.482 --> 00:01:30.381
we tell girls that they need to spend their entire twenties

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960
getting a career and chasing the boss

00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:35.641
babe life instead of finding a good man.

00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:38.321
My mother had four kids and then went back to college,

00:01:38.322 --> 00:01:40.641
and I watched her walk when I was in high school

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:44.261
and then still had another 20 years to build a career.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
People think I'm sexist for saying the things that I'm saying,

00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:49.481
but I think our society is sexist,

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:52.001
telling us to waste our small,

00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.461
fertile window on becoming corporate slave

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.120
instead of dating up and finding a good man.

00:01:58.121 --> 00:01:59.441
Here's the key. Man,

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:00.801
not boy. So, yeah,

00:02:00.802 --> 00:02:02.761
I think you're completely right with this statement.

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:05.241
Um, a lot of women do want good men.

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:05.681
It's just

00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:08.681
I feel like our culture teaches us to look for them in wrong ways.

00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:11.281
One of the prime examples of this is 50 shades of gray.

00:02:11.282 --> 00:02:13.321
Every girl loved it. He was, like,

00:02:13.322 --> 00:02:16.201
in his 30s, and she just graduated college,

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:19.601
probably at 21. And while she was at bars, drinking,

00:02:19.602 --> 00:02:22.361
making bad decisions. Remember the scene where she drank too much

00:02:22.362 --> 00:02:23.961
and he showed up to rescue her?

00:02:23.962 --> 00:02:25.081
You told her the next Day. Hey,

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:26.801
you put yourself in a dangerous situation.

00:02:26.802 --> 00:02:27.761
You shouldn't be doing that.

00:02:27.762 --> 00:02:29.601
As much as everyone wants to get pissed about it,

00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:31.121
every girl was walking that going,

00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:32.841
oh my god, that is so hot,

00:02:32.842 --> 00:02:34.841
he's daddy. But then at the same time,

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:36.521
we are taught by our culture that in our 20s

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:37.681
we don't wanna be told what to do

00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:39.321
because we're independent women.

00:02:39.322 --> 00:02:40.721
But that's the difference,

00:02:40.722 --> 00:02:41.901
sir. Man,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.120
that is a difference between dating a boy in his 20s

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.721
who wants to put you in dangerous,

00:02:46.722 --> 00:02:52.001
precarious situation versus a man who wants to take care of you.

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:56.921
I wish I had found my husband when I was like 23 and he was like

00:02:56.922 --> 00:02:59.521
thirty. I don't know what he would have been, 30.

00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:01.881
The universe just took some time to bring us together.

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:02.241
But yeah,

00:03:02.242 --> 00:03:04.361
everyone is so quick to hate on age gaps.

00:03:04.362 --> 00:03:07.521
But then every girl watches 50 shades of gray and they're like,

00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:09.281
I love him. Age gap!

00:03:09.282 --> 00:03:10.521
Age gap, age gap.

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:11.401
Date up! Date up,

00:03:11.402 --> 00:03:14.121
date up. If I have a girl and she wants to get married young

00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:17.081
and she's in her 20s, I am 100% gonna tell her,

00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:18.781
don't be dating men your same age.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.000
Those are my thoughts. Thank you for the sweet comment.

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.732
I love it when people interact and they do it in a kind way.
