00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.200
a permanent feature on the Mount Pleasant side of the Ravenelle Bridge

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.600
is the USS Yorktown

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:07.680
and me and my little family went there recently for our first trip

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.340
for a homeschool field day

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.160
we truly underestimated how much was going to be here

00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:13.600
the entire ship is a museum

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:18.800
including inside and the top deck filled with history and real life war planes

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:21.520
there was so much to explore that we became members

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.742
I also think it has one of the best views in Charleston
