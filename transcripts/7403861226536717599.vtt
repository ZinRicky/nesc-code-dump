00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.760
drinking is definitely super gross

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:06.760
not worth it will not add to your life in any way

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:08.640
and in fact there's a huge

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.800
huge risk that you could become addicted and have it ruin your life

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:15.720
so in your younger years when you're 21 22

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.660
23 just getting started

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.780
be mindful of that and be very cautious with your drinking habits

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.920
I truly did not notice when I was 21

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:28.780
and dear god I wish I did

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.240
the human brain is not fully developed until the mid twenties 24

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.660
25

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.400
and one of the last part that's forming is the part that is the decision making

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:43.360
it in impulse control and think about it

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:45.580
cause it makes complete and total sense

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.420
when you're a baby the first thing you're learning is function

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.660
how do I speak how do I walk

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.360
there's so many functions that your body is learning when you're a baby infant

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:00.120
like there's milestones that you're reaching

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:03.320
like think you're still losing teeth into like your tween years

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:04.120
like 10 11

00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:05.160
you're still losing teeth

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:12.640
like the last part of your brain and body to develop before you are truly

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:16.940
truly an adult is the part that helps you make decisions

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.620
so you know hold off

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.140
maybe wait until your 30s to start making some really serious life decisions

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.080
even if that is like educational

00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:28.420
what you wanna do with life

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.540
you're only in your 20s once

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.340
uh 30s is not old

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.580
ha ha ha it is not old

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.520
you literally have plenty of time to get it all done

00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:43.280
there's no need to rush your life and be scared into these weird timelines

00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:45.440
because everything is made up

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.640
everything is made up you made up

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.000
everything that is your life is just shit that you made up

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:50.560
you're like hmm

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:51.680
I wanna learn how to play guitar

00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:52.520
so now I know how to play guitar

00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:53.520
I wanna learn how to drive a car

00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:56.020
so now I drive a car I wanna be on the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.280
you know basketball team

00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.000
I wanna be a cheerleader I wanna learn how to swim

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.360
everything you've done up to this point is something that like

00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:03.260
you created and you made happen

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.160
and so yeah

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:08.360
don't get scared into thinking these false timelines exist

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:11.480
they don't you live your life how you wanna live it

00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:13.740
because it is only your life

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.940
this one is a super duper big one

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.280
but only sleep with someone if you really

00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:21.360
really want to sleep with them

00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:22.180
like

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.280
don't let somebody talk you into sex

00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:30.200
that is there's names for that

00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:31.620
and none of them are good

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.400
and it's not gonna feel good in the moment

00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:37.580
it's not gonna do any of the things you maybe think it is

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.680
and you know

00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:42.380
if it's a person that you even think that's a possibility of happening

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.860
you know just don't

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.940
don't spend time in rooms alone with boys like that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.540
that's those are not fun lessons to learn

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.540
like basically the measure should be

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.280
you only sleep with someone cause you're like

00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:57.400
oh my god I want to rip your clothes off

00:02:57.401 --> 00:02:59.540
and I like I will

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.940
I will never stop thinking about this if I don't

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.640
you know make that happen and then think about it

00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.740
think about it if you're not feeling that way

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.880
also it is totally okay to have dirty nasty

00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.700
wild disgusting sex in a safe way

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.000
you keep yourself safe you use Protection

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.400
you get tested you guard your heart

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.520
you know what I mean somebody you're doing those nasty things with

00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:26.780
is not somebody that you're probably gonna be building a family with

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.160
and you know building a family does not need to be your top priority in life

00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:31.740
your top priority could be

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.940
how many fucking fun experiences can I have

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.500
and that could be your life's whole entire goal and mission

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.620
it really could there are lots of people who actually live that way

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.000
you get to decide what brings meaning to life

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:49.500
you get to decide that

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.120
never make decisions on someone

00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:56.660
based off of the made up version of them you created in your mind

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.720
literally never

00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:03.000
do not allow yourself to fall in love with made up versions of people

00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:04.900
that you made up in your own head

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.740
okay I mean that one
