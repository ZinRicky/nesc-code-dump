I started competing in pageants about a year and a half ago,

00:02.401 --> 00:04.401
and one of the first things I heard from a makeup artist

00:04.402 --> 00:05.441
was to use one of these

00:05.442 --> 00:07.081
SK2 masks

00:07.082 --> 00:08.681
before you put your makeup on,

00:08.682 --> 00:10.341
before you put your moisturizer,

00:10.360 --> 00:11.200
anything else on.

00:11.201 --> 00:13.621
I only leave them on for about 15 minutes,

00:13.800 --> 00:16.840
and my skin is super glowy for the whole rest of the day.

00:16.841 --> 00:20.561
I save these for days where I really need my makeup to look amazing.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.921
Like, it needs to look so smooth,

00:22.922 --> 00:24.401
so good. I wake up,

00:24.402 --> 00:25.281
I wash my face,

00:25.282 --> 00:27.881
I don't put any moisturizer anything on.

00:27.882 --> 00:29.121
I do one of these masks.

00:29.122 --> 00:31.161
I like using these before photo shoots.

00:31.162 --> 00:32.521
I like using these before,

00:32.522 --> 00:34.321
like, public appearances where I'm gonna be, like,

00:34.322 --> 00:34.921
speaking.

00:34.922 --> 00:38.521
And I've even used them before competing on stage because it gives,

00:38.522 --> 00:40.081
again, my face like this nice,

00:40.082 --> 00:43.921
smooth below that'll look good even under harsh stage light.

00:43.922 --> 00:47.841
Making sure your skin is moisturized is such an underrated tip

00:47.842 --> 00:48.881
when applying makeup.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.681
Like, no matter how much makeup you use,

00:50.682 --> 00:53.041
no matter how expensive your makeup is,

00:53.042 --> 00:55.561
it's not going to look good if your skin is dry.

00:55.562 --> 00:57.316
Highly recommend grabbing a pack of these.
