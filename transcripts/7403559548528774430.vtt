00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
And who kills the men who are victims of murder?

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:03.481
Is it. Is it women or?

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:05.601
Mostly men. If men didn't exist,

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:07.861
there would be virtually no victims of murder.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.440
And often

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:11.841
men who are violent towards men have been violent towards women first.

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:14.581
It's actually a predictor of being a mass shooter.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.880
And actually, if we took violence against women seriously,

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:20.301
we probably be able to prevent so many more mass shootings,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.480
many men dying at the hands of other men.

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:23.001
So, yeah,

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.961
a lot of men are victims of murder because violent men murder them.

00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:28.041
And if you want less violent men in the world,

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:29.121
maybe you should join a movement.

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.561
Uh, it's called the feminist movement.

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:32.921
Cause we've been working on this stuff for a long time.

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:35.561
And instead of making our efforts harder with comments like this,

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:36.841
maybe you could join us. You know,

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:39.661
we really guys like you making it easier for us to save your life.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.406
That'd be just great.
