00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.040
I was just watching my sweet videos friend,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.600
and she's, like,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.440
bragging about her boyfriend.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.040
She's like, oh, my god,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.120
I have friends coming into town,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.680
and my boyfriend's helping me get the house already.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.360
Like, she's like, oh, my god,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.220
what is going on?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.580
And then in the comments,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.920
I see one of my other really good friends like,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.880
is he doing it for a show,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.900
or is this for real?

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.840
I fucking love this.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.280
I love this energy.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.760
Yesterday I had a friend come over to my house,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.440
and she was, like,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.940
gushing about her fiance,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.000
and I was like, okay, cool.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.600
But you're safe, right?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.400
Like, this person honors you and respects you,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.200
and you feel like an equal value member, right?

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.840
Like, the days of just believing your friend

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.440
that she's in a great relationship are gone.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.600
We're checking in now, like.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.580
But you're sure, right?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.140
You're sure?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.160
That's a good friend.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.080
That's a good fucking friend.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.332
And I'm so proud of us. I love you.
