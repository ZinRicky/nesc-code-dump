00:01.240 --> 00:03.100
So good. What the heck?

00:03.200 --> 00:05.280
I never had a Caesar salad wrap.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.080
I've been craving these so much

00:07.080 --> 00:08.760
cause they're all over my for you page,

00:08.760 --> 00:10.580
so I had to make myself one.

00:10.720 --> 00:11.680
Let's get started.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.200
This wrap was perfectly crunchy,

00:14.200 --> 00:15.440
salty, spicy.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.460
It was so good.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.880
So I started by slicing up some sourdough bread,

00:18.880 --> 00:20.640
drizzling it with some olive oil,

00:20.640 --> 00:21.560
salt and pepper,

00:21.560 --> 00:24.100
popping that in the oven to make my croutons.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.440
While those were baking,

00:25.440 --> 00:27.480
I made my breading for the chicken,

00:27.480 --> 00:28.980
which was some egg,

00:29.280 --> 00:31.200
bread crumbs and flour.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.800
So then I drenched my chicken in the flour,

00:33.800 --> 00:35.860
then the eggs and the bread crumbs.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.840
I shallow fried my chicken

00:37.840 --> 00:39.520
and basted it with the hot oil

00:39.520 --> 00:43.280
to just get an even layer of brown crust all over.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.880
Then I just let them rest on a wire rack

00:45.880 --> 00:47.120
while I made my dressing,

00:47.120 --> 00:49.880
which I just chopped up some garlic

00:49.880 --> 00:52.440
and stuff some anchovies with that,

00:52.440 --> 00:54.600
and then started on all the other components

00:54.600 --> 00:55.600
for the dressing.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.240
Gave that a really good mix

00:57.240 --> 00:59.440
and added that to a bigger bowl

00:59.440 --> 01:01.580
cause I realised my bowl was so tiny.

01:01.960 --> 01:02.960
Kept whisking it,

01:02.960 --> 01:05.000
adding oil until it looked creamy,

01:05.000 --> 01:06.840
and then it was time to assemble the salad.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.640
So I did romaine,

01:08.640 --> 01:10.040
the chicken, croutons,

01:10.040 --> 01:10.680
the dressing,

01:10.680 --> 01:11.600
and obviously

01:11.600 --> 01:13.640
can't forget about the Parmesan cheese.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.280
I'm the worst at rolling up tortillas,

01:16.280 --> 01:17.560
so just bear with me.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.640
It doesn't look that great,

01:18.640 --> 01:20.800
but it's absolutely amazing.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.380
So good. What the heck
