00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.240
While we are in the midst of our New Year's resolutions,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.440
which usually means drinking less and working out more,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.240
maybe eating a tad healthier,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.260
I wanted to send this reminder to whoever might need it.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.300
Skinny does not equal healthy.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.960
You see, about 4 5 years back,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.240
pre COVID, of course,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.080
I was in the best shape of my life.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.880
I was working out regularly.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.640
I was the thinnest I'd ever been.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.560
I was the most fit I'd ever been.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.820
Here's a little reference.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.400
I was a certifiable gym rat at this point.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.360
I'm currently not in that good of a shape.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.400
Some of my clothes don't fit very well.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.040
I have since had a third baby,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.880
and I have some well earned weight gain

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.640
after eating and drinking everything in sight

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.760
for the past six months.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.920
So does that bother me? A bit? Yeah.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.400
Will I be focusing on fitness in the New Year? Yes,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.320
but my fitness goals will not be aesthetic.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.460
I want to increase in stamina,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.160
strength, flexibility,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.560
balance, and endurance.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.160
Because when I was that fit,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.200
eating clean,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.560
obsessing over workout,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.920
pretty much orthorexic,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.560
my period stopped for four months

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.000
and my immune system crashed.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.892
Looks can be deceiving.
