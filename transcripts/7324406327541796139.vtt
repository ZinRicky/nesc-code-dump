00:00.240 --> 00:01.880
Okay, let's talk about this.

00:01.880 --> 00:03.460
So first of all,

00:03.560 --> 00:07.380
a lot of us stay at home moms don't have rich husbands

00:08.640 --> 00:11.900
we could cause we sacrifice and we make it happen.

00:12.240 --> 00:16.100
You'd literally be surprised how many costs you can cut

00:16.400 --> 00:17.680
and how many things you can,

00:17.680 --> 00:18.960
like, sacrifice.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.580
You literally be surprised.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.320
There's like so much talk about, like,

00:22.320 --> 00:23.200
how we're privileged,

00:23.200 --> 00:24.820
oh my gosh, you're so lucky.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.560
There's so much talk about that,

00:26.560 --> 00:28.960
but what people don't know is,

00:28.960 --> 00:31.480
is that we're determined to give our children

00:31.480 --> 00:33.060
a better life that we had.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.520
There's just choices you gotta make.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.440
Because I knew I wasn't gonna be the mom

00:37.440 --> 00:39.480
dropping off my baby at daycare.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.480
I just knew that wasn't gonna be me.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.240
I, so I prioritized.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.860
There's a lot of things you can cut costs on

00:45.920 --> 00:49.200
and do so you guys can live off one income.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.060
And I know society is gonna tell you that's impossible

00:52.400 --> 00:53.360
and whatever,

00:53.360 --> 00:54.960
but it's not,

00:54.960 --> 00:56.360
it's not impossible

00:56.360 --> 00:58.600
and it's 100% doable.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.720
And again, everyone's situation is different.

01:00.720 --> 01:01.440
So I don't wanna,

01:01.440 --> 01:02.600
I don't wanna say like, oh,

01:02.600 --> 01:03.560
this works for everyone,

01:03.560 --> 01:04.160
but I feel like

01:04.160 --> 01:06.560
for most people that think you're so lucky,

01:06.560 --> 01:07.040
you're so this,

01:07.040 --> 01:07.900
you're so that

01:07.920 --> 01:08.800
you can do that,

01:08.800 --> 01:09.600
you can do it too.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.840
And you just have to sacrifice

01:10.840 --> 01:12.200
and go look at your cost.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.060
Go look at what you can cut down on.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.880
Your kids don't need a fancy house,

01:15.880 --> 01:17.360
they don't need a brand New car.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.760
Like, they're not gonna remember those things,

01:18.760 --> 01:20.280
but they're gonna remember you.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.720
That you were there every,

01:21.720 --> 01:22.960
every single day,

01:22.960 --> 01:24.180
every step of the way.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.860
You didn't miss a milestone.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.700
They're gonna remember that.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.240
And before you twist my words,

01:29.240 --> 01:31.660
this is not shaming any other moms out there.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.760
Um, because in one situation is different,

01:34.760 --> 01:35.840
and, you know,

01:35.840 --> 01:36.520
you know what's best.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.200
But this is just my opinion on the subject,

01:38.200 --> 01:39.320
because I'm just

01:39.320 --> 01:41.920
honestly so tired of people constantly saying,

01:41.920 --> 01:42.600
you're so privileged.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.800
Like, if we were walking around with, like,

01:44.800 --> 01:46.400
rich husbands and, like,

01:46.400 --> 01:47.000
all this stuff,

01:47.000 --> 01:48.220
like, no, ma'am,

01:48.400 --> 01:49.320
we sacrifice,

01:49.320 --> 01:50.120
were determined,

01:50.120 --> 01:53.191
and we want to give our kids the best life.
