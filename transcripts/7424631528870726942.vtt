00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
If you're looking for a reason to divorce your husband,

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.701
I got you. Stanford did a research study on children

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.240
published in the journal of neuroscience,

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.281
where they did MRIs in children's brain

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:12.081
and saw what parts of the brain were stimulated

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:13.561
when they listen to their moms voices

00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:15.481
versus when they listen to novel voices.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:15.961
Meaning, like,

00:00:15.962 --> 00:00:19.121
friends or strangers are just other new people in their life.

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:20.941
And right around the age of 13

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.060
is when children's brains kind of stop

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.040
getting the same sort of reward

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.361
from hearing their mom's voices.

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:29.801
And now everyone's voices is just as rewarding.

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:32.981
So mom is now in a sea of voices.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.920
So as a mother, when you stay for the kids

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:41.201
and you are just kind of gonna trudge it through life

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:43.281
so that you can make it to their adulthood,

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:45.941
and that's when you'll start to build relationships with them.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.400
You were naturally given those first 12 to 13 years of life

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:52.841
that it was kind of just you guys.

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:56.721
They were young, very dependent on you,

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.681
and you had all the opportunity in the world

00:00:58.682 --> 00:01:00.161
to be the mom that you need to be

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:02.041
and to speak into their life the way that you wanted to,

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:02.361
and to, like,

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.321
teach them the lessons and give them all the things that you wanted to.

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:06.361
That's why sometimes

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:09.281
we look back on our children's childhood and feel so much regret,

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:11.721
because we realize how precious and tender those moments were.

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:15.601
So I would just challenge you to think about,

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:17.641
do you really wanna give up those years

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:19.541
being in a miserable marriage,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.160
knowing that one day

00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:23.541
your voice is just gonna be another in a sea of voices?
