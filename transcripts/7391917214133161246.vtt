00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.200
I tried to film a get ready with me while I was like

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:04.600
talking to the camera I couldn't concentrate

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:08.400
I didn't know what I was putting on my face and trying to say at the same time

00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:09.600
does anybody else have that problem

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.300
or is it just me anywho

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.320
last week I chatted a little about how I became a homeschool mom

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:17.160
but I wanted to talk a little about what I did in between

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:19.860
I had my oldest daughter in my third year of teaching

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.880
at the beginning of the school year

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:23.800
I had her in August and then I took six weeks of Matern leave

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:27.120
which not enough and then I went back and finish out the school year

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:29.280
so that entire year the first year of her life

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:31.920
I was a working mom and if you know anything about being a teacher

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:33.880
it is not a 40 hour week job

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:35.320
you are doing after school stuff

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:37.080
you are doing things on the weekends prepping

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.080
planning all things

00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:41.320
I was so miserable so at the end of the year

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:44.640
I quit and I was just a stay at home mom until I had my second

00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.800
and they are two years apart

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.400
and then when my son was like four months old

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.460
I started teaching from home

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.560
and I taught English to students in China

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.240
so my hours were awful

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:57.520
but we were just in this place financially where we just could not get ahead

00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:58.880
we were living paycheck to paycheck

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:03.680
my husband was working a hundred plus hours and it just didn't feel good

00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:05.440
so I start working from home

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:08.040
I did that for two years and we changed our lifestyle

00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:12.080
moved into an RV and that I became just a stay home mom again

00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:14.600
and then when my daughter was in pre K

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:17.760
her teacher went on maternity leave and I said for her

00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:21.820
and then I became a preschool teacher for two years until my daughter started

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.480
so over the years I have been a working mom

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.360
I have been a stay at home mom

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:28.320
a work from home mom and now homeschool mom

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.080
and I can honestly say from all of those experiences

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:36.760
this is by far the most taxing and the hardest thing I have ever done in my life

00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:38.762
but also the most rewarding
