00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.960
Let's make my mom's chocolate chip cookies.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.680
You're gonna start with a

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.200
one cup of shortening of your choice.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.920
I used butter,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.720
one cup of sugar,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.460
and then half a cup of brown sugar.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.320
Cream those together,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.880
which just means to mix them together.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.440
And then we're gonna add two eggs.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.960
I measure vanilla by heart,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.200
but you could probably also do 1 teaspoon.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.080
This was way more than I actually needed by accident.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.800
Mix together,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.560
and then you're gonna add

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.720
one and a/2 teaspoons of baking soda.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.400
And then you're also gonna add in another

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.180
one and a/2 teaspoon of salt.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.720
Slowly add in the flour. Between 2.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.960
Two and a/2 to 3 cups.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.120
If you want sugar cookies,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.680
use less flour.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.120
If you want dough or cookies,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.300
use more flour.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.160
Add in half a bag of chocolate chips.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.200
Mix that together.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.400
I'm then gonna take my handy dandy cookie scooper,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.840
and I'm going to put those on a baking sheet,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.280
pop those in the oven at 3:50 for 10 to 12 minutes,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.880
and then they will come out the most gooey,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.620
delicious cookies you have ever had in your life.
