00:00.720 --> 00:03.460
Get ready with me to go to our Omas.

00:03.720 --> 00:06.320
I'm gonna be walking you through some of my makeup.

00:06.321 --> 00:08.001
This is my favorite lip color.

00:08.002 --> 00:11.381
This the new confidante by L'oreal.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.520
I've really been getting into gloss,

00:14.521 --> 00:16.561
so this is the laritzy gloss,

00:16.562 --> 00:18.261
and the color is mauve.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.320
I really like how this adds a lot of shine to my lips.

00:21.321 --> 00:23.121
I don't know. I used to never use gloss,

00:23.122 --> 00:23.981
but now I do.

00:24.680 --> 00:27.800
I obviously had a bit of my makeup done before filming,

00:27.801 --> 00:29.601
so I'm just doing my eyes and lips.

00:29.602 --> 00:33.181
And now I am going in with a nude color.

00:33.400 --> 00:37.200
Pinkish nude color for the base of my eyeshadow.

00:37.201 --> 00:39.561
This palette is discontinued,

00:39.562 --> 00:40.701
unfortunately.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.200
And now I am going in with the crease color.

00:44.201 --> 00:48.121
This is a Mavi pink dusty rose kind of color.

00:48.122 --> 00:51.481
I just really like pink tones on my eyes.

00:51.482 --> 00:52.901
I'm not sure why.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.120
I know I read somewhere that pink and red really enhances green eyes,

00:57.121 --> 00:59.261
so I'm guessing that is why.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.000
I'm now going in to do my eyebrows.

01:02.001 --> 01:03.641
I'm not the best at eyebrows,

01:03.642 --> 01:06.101
but I do like the L'oreal blonde shade.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.960
Gotta curl those lashes.

01:08.961 --> 01:10.881
I was not born with amazing lashes,

01:10.882 --> 01:12.961
so I definitely have to do that.

01:12.962 --> 01:14.921
And then I'm using the Tarte mascara.

01:14.922 --> 01:16.721
I got this sample a while ago,

01:16.722 --> 01:18.421
and I really like it.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.580
I'm now pulling my hair down just seeing what I'm working with.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.880
I had a blowout,

01:23.881 --> 01:25.881
so I am kind of good.

01:25.882 --> 01:26.921
For a couple days,

01:26.922 --> 01:28.481
but I'm just fluffing it up.

01:28.482 --> 01:33.961
I love just a nice, freshly done blowout dress of the day.

01:33.962 --> 01:35.761
I will tag the company

01:35.762 --> 01:37.081
and my favorite perfume

01:37.082 --> 01:40.361
you guys know born lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker.

01:40.362 --> 01:41.941
Just so sweet.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.520
And this is a new pocketbook I got.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.401
I'm obsessed with mini purses,

01:46.402 --> 01:48.921
you guys. I will be tagging the brand as well.

01:48.922 --> 01:51.901
I love the purple shade for summer.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.720
These earrings are from the exact same company that the purse is.

01:56.721 --> 01:57.841
Again, I will tag it.

01:57.842 --> 02:02.021
And these are just some cute gold earrings with floral details.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.040
We have an hour and a half road trip to Omas,

02:05.041 --> 02:07.901
so we are excited to get on the road and get going.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.180
When I be the papa, you can be

02:19.440 --> 02:21.060
the mom.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.880
We are doing a cookout.

02:28.881 --> 02:30.521
I am prepping the fruit.

02:30.522 --> 02:32.241
This is just some pineapple.

02:32.242 --> 02:33.921
And I'm wearing my favorite apron.

02:33.922 --> 02:37.481
I will tag the company of this apron as well.

02:37.482 --> 02:40.381
She makes the most beautiful aprons ever.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.780
Husband is in charge of grill duty.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.300
I am searing some onions for our burgers.

02:51.320 --> 02:55.180
Does anybody else put a paper towel with

02:55.520 --> 02:57.520
ice on top of the salad to keep it cold?

02:57.521 --> 02:59.861
Because my Alma does this, and now I do.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.480
Setting the table.

03:01.481 --> 03:02.981
Love the blue and yellow.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.840
And now we are cutting the ribs.

03:05.841 --> 03:07.501
We are so hungry.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.100
Cannot wait to devour this food.

03:10.840 --> 03:11.920
And to end the day,

03:11.921 --> 03:12.761
some ice cream,

03:12.762 --> 03:13.884
fruit, and coffee.
