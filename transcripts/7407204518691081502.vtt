00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.800
it's time to lesson plan for next week

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.600
except we only did school two days last week

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.800
so I'm really just rewriting all the things I planned last week for this week

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:07.920
last week was my daughter's birthday

00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:09.760
and things just came up that I wasn't expecting

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:11.800
so we didn't get nearly as much done as I'd hoped for

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:13.560
and honestly this week is a little crazy too

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:14.440
with closing on our house

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:15.880
but we're gonna try to get some school work done

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:19.880
I would much rather have a plan and not execute it than not plan and wish I did

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:22.960
I'm going into this week with the expectation that it is going to be thrown off

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:24.240
but just in case it isn't

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:25.680
I'm red when I do my lesson plans

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.880
I plan for the perfect week

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.440
and what I mean by that is we get every subject done every day

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:30.840
plus all the extra activities

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.240
and honestly this very rarely ever happens

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.240
but I plan this way so I'm ready for anything

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:36.400
I plan for our main lesson

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:39.120
plus enrichment activities in case they need to go a little deeper

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:41.320
and extra practice in case they're kinda struggling with something

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:41.840
and then each day

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.600
I decide what we're gonna do based on our motivation and our attitude

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:45.440
because let's be honest

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.160
there are some days we just wanna get through school and move on

00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:50.160
and then there are other days where kids are enjoying what we're doing

00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:52.880
and they wanna do more and you never know what you're gonna get until the day of

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:54.680
so I plan for both scenarios

00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:56.520
that does mean there's a lot of playing on my part

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.320
but I think it's worth it

00:00:57.321 --> 00:00:58.686
and it's what I signed up for
