00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.860
please tell me if any other woman relates to this

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.860
you meet a man

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.960
and you know that you have a partner

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:07.201
or you're uninterested

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:08.481
you're not on the market

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:10.361
you know your current situation

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:11.741
but you meet a man

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.560
and he is unaware of your situation

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.601
and he is very excited to meet you and have a conversation with you

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:17.601
and you're like oh

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:19.321
I know you're only being nice to me

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.721
cause you think you might have a chance to have sex with me

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.001
and I know that there's no chance of that

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.781
but you're really hopeful that there is

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.480
and so you're trying to like

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:29.681
pace their niceness for them

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:30.441
because you're like

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:32.801
I'm not gonna give you what you're looking for

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:33.761
and I know that

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:36.881
and I know what you're looking for just by the way you're talking to me

00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:39.141
so I'm gonna try to like

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.540
walk you off that bridge by like

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.120
as the conversations going

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:44.201
so as to not lead you on

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:46.101
because this is gonna get really awkward

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.560
and then when they finally get to the part where they kinda like

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.161
ask you for your number or ask you

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:51.061
you know they they

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.200
they do the thing

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.121
and you're like oh

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:54.041
you fucked around

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:55.661
and now you have to find out

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.920
and then immediately

00:00:56.921 --> 00:00:58.641
like all of their niceness and

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.441
and happiness and cordialness

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:01.441
like goes away

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:02.281
and you're like uh huh

00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:04.301
yeah that's what I thought thanks ugh

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.100
I hate those interactions
