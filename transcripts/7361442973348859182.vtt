00:00.680 --> 00:01.640
Good morning, everyone.

00:01.641 --> 00:02.721
I'm on the barnyard,

00:02.722 --> 00:03.521
as you can tell.

00:03.522 --> 00:04.501
Hi, girls.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.840
My heifer gave birth yesterday.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.561
Milky and a heifer can be a little bit tricky

00:09.562 --> 00:11.721
because they're not used to someone tugging on them.

00:11.722 --> 00:13.781
I've done this a couple times now.

00:14.720 --> 00:16.260
Hello, Danny.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.240
Right here is a head gate.

00:21.241 --> 00:22.841
So she'll put her head through here.

00:22.842 --> 00:25.281
Of these little pan there,

00:25.282 --> 00:27.021
so she can't get out while you're milking.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.060
Let's go, daddy.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.480
She's contained.

00:35.481 --> 00:36.561
She's eating her grain.

00:36.562 --> 00:39.321
Now we're gonna get to work on milking her.

00:39.322 --> 00:41.201
Staunchen, we only use for training.

00:41.202 --> 00:42.081
Maybe for a week,

00:42.082 --> 00:43.361
two weeks. To paint on the cow.

00:43.362 --> 00:46.961
What I love to put on is some superior cow cream.

00:46.962 --> 00:47.921
This is for swollen,

00:47.922 --> 00:48.921
utter sore teeth.

00:48.922 --> 00:49.881
Peppermint cream.

00:49.882 --> 00:51.161
It has that, like, warm,

00:51.162 --> 00:52.241
cold sensation.

00:52.242 --> 00:54.881
Wanna be facing this way so your.

00:54.882 --> 00:56.361
Your hand can be like this.

00:56.362 --> 01:00.081
We're obviously not saving today because train. Yeah,

01:00.082 --> 01:00.981
we're training.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.760
As she kicks, you don't wanna let go,

01:05.761 --> 01:07.981
you let go. And that's training her that.

01:08.680 --> 01:09.680
That if she kicks,

01:09.681 --> 01:10.821
she gets relief.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.360
Keep your hand on the teeth.

01:16.361 --> 01:18.701
I'm gonna try to do two.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.980
And she's doing great.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.160
So this right now is just colostrum.

01:37.161 --> 01:38.521
Her milk hasn't come in.

01:38.522 --> 01:42.841
Dairy cows, they produce more than enough colostrum for their calf.

01:42.842 --> 01:45.441
So just like dairy cows produce a lot more milk,

01:45.442 --> 01:49.421
and it takes just to raise one calf,

01:49.680 --> 01:51.180
the same with their colostrum.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.940
My hand right here is.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.900
Is cramping. We're Okay, good.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.540
You're okay.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.780
We got done with one side.

02:12.680 --> 02:13.700
Hahaha.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.860
It's Stella,

02:26.600 --> 02:27.150
Mama
