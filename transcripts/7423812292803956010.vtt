00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.160
all right 15

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:04.280
time just started raining

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:05.540
rainy at the first band

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.140
and then it just has to rain all day

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.040
we are on the dirty side of the Hurricane

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:12.620
which means thunderstorms and tornadoes

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.720
I've never been afraid of those during a Hurricane until Halloween

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.680
when we literally got hit by a tornado

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:19.620
and so that's a new fear that's unlocked

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.220
so I used to not be anxious about this part of this Hurricane

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.300
so now I am

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.390
so it'll be fun
