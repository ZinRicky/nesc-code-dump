Hi everybody,

00:01.000 --> 00:02.640
and welcome back to my channel.

00:02.640 --> 00:05.480
Today I really wanted to talk about something.

00:05.480 --> 00:07.640
I've been seeing it a lot on the internet

00:07.640 --> 00:09.460
and I want to address it.

00:09.560 --> 00:10.440
And that is

00:10.440 --> 00:12.300
a lot of women are

00:12.680 --> 00:16.340
putting a big emphasis on their future husband

00:16.400 --> 00:19.220
making a certain amount of money

00:19.360 --> 00:24.080
and having particular physical characteristics.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.240
And let's talk about that.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.720
So I'm sure you guys have heard of it

00:28.720 --> 00:31.800
and seen these street interviews of these women

00:31.800 --> 00:33.880
saying that they want a six pack,

00:33.880 --> 00:35.460
six foot tall,

00:35.680 --> 00:36.960
six figure man,

00:36.960 --> 00:40.620
or saying particular numbers and things like that.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.960
And if you are wanting to attract a masculine man,

00:43.960 --> 00:46.820
a man who wants to provide for his future wife,

00:46.920 --> 00:50.460
I would restrain yourself from using any

00:50.560 --> 00:53.840
vocabulary that is like that.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.480
That's not gonna get you a provider, man.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.480
That's not gonna get you a man that looks anything

00:59.480 --> 01:01.280
or acts anything like that.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.940
That is gonna push men away from you.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.740
A feminine woman won't say these things.

01:06.960 --> 01:08.860
She could, however, say,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.680
I would like to be with a provider.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.160
But you don't need to list any salary

01:15.160 --> 01:16.800
amount or anything like that.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.600
To be honest,

01:17.600 --> 01:19.800
I didn't even know the money my husband made

01:19.800 --> 01:21.720
until later in our dating life

01:21.720 --> 01:23.060
because it didn't matter.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.200
What matters is his character.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.960
And if he can show you that,

01:26.960 --> 01:28.040
he will be a provider.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.203
And he will show you that very early on.
