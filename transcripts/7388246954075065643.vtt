00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
Rumble and slim aren't big snackers,

00:02.081 --> 00:03.761
but when they do request something,

00:03.762 --> 00:05.001
I usually make it.

00:05.002 --> 00:09.181
So today they requested some chips and guacamole and some popsicles.

00:09.320 --> 00:12.080
I got started on making my dough for my tortillas

00:12.081 --> 00:14.801
by combining some corn flour with some warm water

00:14.802 --> 00:18.441
before forming them into little balls and pressing them flat.

00:18.442 --> 00:21.961
I placed them in hot skillet and fried them until they puffed up

00:21.962 --> 00:25.781
and then transferred them over to a kitchen towel to keep them warm.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.420
In the meantime, I moved on to making my popsicles.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.340
I decided to make some lemon basil popsicles,

00:31.400 --> 00:33.120
so I juiced all of my lemons

00:33.121 --> 00:35.601
before moving on to making my simple syrup

00:35.602 --> 00:37.401
by combining some water, sugar,

00:37.402 --> 00:39.321
and a splash of maple syrup.

00:39.322 --> 00:40.921
I let that come to a boil.

00:40.922 --> 00:44.161
While that was boiling, I finally chopped my basil.

00:44.162 --> 00:46.241
Once my mixture came to room temperature,

00:46.242 --> 00:48.721
I poured in my lemon juice and my basil

00:48.722 --> 00:51.541
before transferring it over to popsicle molds.

00:51.560 --> 00:52.640
Put the lid on top

00:52.641 --> 00:55.881
and pop these in the freezer for about three to four hours.

00:55.882 --> 00:59.101
And in the meantime got started on making my guacamole.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.760
Mashed up some avocado and kept the pits in to keep it fresh

01:02.761 --> 01:04.801
before squeezing on some lime juice.

01:04.802 --> 01:06.481
I chopped up some tomatoes,

01:06.482 --> 01:07.501
some onions,

01:07.800 --> 01:11.480
cilantro before putting all of that in the bowl with my avocado.

01:11.481 --> 01:13.361
I seasoned it with some salt,

01:13.362 --> 01:17.281
cumin, and some more lime juice before giving that a good mix,

01:17.282 --> 01:19.881
making sure Everything is combined this point.

01:19.882 --> 01:23.721
I cut up my tortillas and fried them until they were golden brown,

01:23.722 --> 01:25.201
and while they were still hot,

01:25.202 --> 01:27.221
I sprinkled them with some salt.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.240
Kids couldn't wait,

01:28.241 --> 01:32.281
so I got the popsicles out and gave them one before plating the chips,

01:32.282 --> 01:34.421
and they absolutely loved it.
