My favorite thing about this tartlet tubing mascara

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:05.461
is that it comes off.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.280
I thought it was super magical because it's like you put on a coat

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:10.721
and then it kind of sticks to itself

00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:12.101
so it'll give you length.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.440
It's that it actually comes off.

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:15.601
It's not, you know,

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:16.721
with typical mascara.

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:19.401
I don't always fucking wash my face before I go to bed.

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:20.361
Or even if I do,

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:22.981
I can't always get the mascara all the way off.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.240
So then I wake up, and then I already have, like,

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:27.741
black shit smeared under my eyes.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.740
I know you've seen my other Tik Toks,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.140
and I hate it.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.960
This shit just comes off.

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:39.501
It flakes off. At my daughter was like, hello,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.280
this tartlet tubing mascara is super, duper,

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:45.081
duper worth it.

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:45.921
And the stay away.

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:48.641
It comes in the trio of their best sellers.

00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:50.701
And I get why they're the best sellers.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.456
Super worth it. And link right here.
