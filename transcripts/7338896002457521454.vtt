00:00.080 --> 00:01.840
Here's everything my toddlers ate today.

00:01.840 --> 00:03.520
I just wanna start off by saying that

00:03.520 --> 00:05.520
they eat whatever my husband and I eat.

00:05.520 --> 00:07.640
We don't make them any separate meals.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.560
This is also not what everyday looks like.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.240
So I started off with breakfast.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.560
They had a cup of milk

00:12.560 --> 00:16.260
and then I started making this French toast casserole.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.160
Combined all of my wet ingredients

00:18.160 --> 00:21.320
and then poured them over my sliced up sourdough bread.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.880
And then I made a crumble topping to go on top

00:23.880 --> 00:25.480
before I popped in the oven.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.160
In the meantime,

00:26.160 --> 00:29.720
I also made a peach vanilla puree to go on top.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.560
Once it was cold,

00:30.560 --> 00:32.880
I served them up a piece with that puree

00:32.880 --> 00:33.960
and some cherries,

00:33.960 --> 00:35.700
and that was their breakfast.

00:35.720 --> 00:36.520
Lunchtime rolled around.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.320
I always need a lunchtime pick me up.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.240
You guys know that

00:39.240 --> 00:40.960
today was iced mango juice.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.940
I've just been craving mangoes.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.520
Then I got started on making some pasta

00:45.520 --> 00:46.680
and letting that rest

00:46.680 --> 00:50.240
while I thinly sliced up my fennel and onions.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.320
Cause I was making a caramelized fennel and onion pasta.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.920
I let that go on the stove

00:54.920 --> 00:57.300
while I rolled out my pasta dough.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.000
This was such a simple dish to make,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
but it tasted so good.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.120
And once that was done,

01:02.120 --> 01:04.200
I just toss the pasta in the sauce.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.720
I also added some peas

01:05.720 --> 01:06.920
and then topped all of that

01:06.920 --> 01:08.880
with a lot of Parmesan cheese.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.320
Tied them over until dinner.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.100
I made them a little snack.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.880
These oranges are so good.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.480
They also had some pickles that they wanted more of

01:16.480 --> 01:18.760
and the granola bars I made the other day.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.680
Then I wanted an early dinner,

01:20.680 --> 01:23.320
so I made roasted potatoes.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.360
I started by peeling about four russet potatoes

01:26.360 --> 01:28.600
and chopping them up into large cubes

01:28.600 --> 01:30.080
and then par boiling them.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.160
So a little secret.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.120
Add baking soda to your water.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.040
Once those were done,

01:34.040 --> 01:34.880
I strained them

01:34.880 --> 01:36.240
and then shook them in the pot

01:36.240 --> 01:38.560
before pouring them in my hot skillet

01:38.560 --> 01:40.900
that was coated in duck fat.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.200
I let those go in the oven for about an hour,

01:43.200 --> 01:44.400
but I kept flipping them

01:44.400 --> 01:46.840
to get an even crust on all sides.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.080
Cut up some Brussels sprouts

01:48.080 --> 01:50.760
and then seasoned my chicken with some salt and pepper

01:50.760 --> 01:52.400
before hand searing it.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.200
I basted it with some butter,

01:54.200 --> 01:55.400
thyme, and Rosemary

01:55.400 --> 01:57.500
and put that in the oven to finish off.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.480
And I made some quick balsamic

01:59.480 --> 02:01.280
and honey glazed Brussels sprouts

02:01.280 --> 02:03.320
before letting my chicken rest.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.880
Then I plated it all up

02:04.880 --> 02:07.280
and I had some leftover gravy in the fridge

02:07.280 --> 02:07.960
that I thought

02:07.960 --> 02:10.172
was gonna go perfect with this. And it did.
