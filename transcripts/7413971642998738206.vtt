00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.560
Do you have a trip coming up

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:04.441
and you need to bring all of your chargers and cords

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:07.141
and you don't want them to get all mixed up.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.840
This little thing from the TikTok shop,

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:10.241
it looks like the dumbest little thing.

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.241
Like, oh,

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:12.121
I could put my chart.

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:14.161
I know how to keep track of my chargers when I'm gone.

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:15.141
Um,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.680
the thing is, when you need to charge so many fucking things

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:20.441
and nothing brings their own fucking block,

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:22.981
so you have to have a million little blocks.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.840
I keep an extra set of wired headphones just in case,

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:27.381
my backup battery.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.420
And then here I can keep all the cords for everything

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.660
separated from like the longer ones and the shorter ones.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.640
Nothing goes missing. Holds everything.

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:37.781
Look how nicely.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.560
And then you just zip it back up and don't lose anything.

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:44.161
And then I have a visual to see.

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:45.881
Do I have everything?

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:50.281
Every charger and cord type thing that I brought with me.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:51.561
Is it coming back home with me?

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:53.481
Cause it has a designated space.

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:59.561
This thing is a lifesaver for traveling and keeping your shit together.

00:00:59.562 --> 00:01:01.861
Cause I don't wanna fucking replace all those things.
