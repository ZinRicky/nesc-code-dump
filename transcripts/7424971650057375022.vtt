00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.000
I am starting a series called Arranging Advent

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.561
where we are arranging our lives just in time for advent season.

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:05.881
Advent season is meant to be joyful,

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:08.001
but often we find ourselves stressed and worn out.

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.201
Prepping ahead of time can take a lot of that stress away.

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:12.641
October is when I start putting my plans for advent into motion.

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:14.201
Start by writing out the different sections

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:15.201
that make sense for your family.

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:17.001
For us that's electrical, lifting, gifts,

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:17.761
baking, etc.

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:18.961
I go through all of my books.

00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:21.721
I love Suma Domestica. Cannot recommend her books enough.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.721
Also pull out all my cookbooks of baking ideas I wanna use

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:26.890
as well as homemade gift recipes.
