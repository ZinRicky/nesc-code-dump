00:01.160 --> 00:04.500
The highlight of my week is definitely date night with Daniel.

00:04.680 --> 00:06.560
We try to go on a date once a week.

00:06.560 --> 00:10.600
We usually go out to dinner somewhere fancy ish.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.360
Tonight we went to a place in Park City.

00:12.360 --> 00:16.080
We got deviled eggs for appetizer and Brussels sprouts.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.660
The deviled eggs look like ice cream cones.

00:19.080 --> 00:23.620
Daniel got a. Well actually I got a pork chop wrapped in prosciutto.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.400
He got beef barley plate,

00:25.400 --> 00:26.720
but I ended up switching with him

00:26.720 --> 00:29.340
cause his always looks so much better than mine.

00:29.560 --> 00:33.334
Flora Joe was with us and she slept the whole time like a champ.
