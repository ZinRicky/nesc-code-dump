00:00.360 --> 00:01.320
Date nights are rare,

00:01.320 --> 00:02.600
so today I told my husband

00:02.600 --> 00:04.840
that we're gonna have an Italian date night at home

00:04.840 --> 00:06.120
and that I'm cooking.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.940
So I obviously have to start by making focaccia.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.240
I let the dough rest in the fridge overnight,

00:11.240 --> 00:13.760
and then I just put it out to rise.

00:13.760 --> 00:14.560
In the meantime,

00:14.560 --> 00:15.760
I started my Bolognese

00:15.760 --> 00:18.380
and started chopping up all my vegetables.

00:18.840 --> 00:22.280
I seared off my ground beef in batches to get that nice

00:22.280 --> 00:23.480
crisp outer there.

00:23.480 --> 00:26.420
I pulled it out of the pan and fried up my pancetta.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.120
I cannot open wine,

00:28.120 --> 00:29.560
so lucky had to help me.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.400
I added my vegetables to my pot,

00:31.400 --> 00:32.320
my ground beef,

00:32.320 --> 00:34.700
my wine, tomato paste, bay leaf,

00:34.880 --> 00:35.680
chicken stock,

00:35.680 --> 00:36.920
milk, nutmeg,

00:36.920 --> 00:40.360
and then let that simmer for about two to three hours.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.240
In the meantime,

00:41.240 --> 00:43.480
I started prepping my pasta dough.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.600
One thing about lucky is

00:44.600 --> 00:46.900
he will always need my dough for me,

00:47.000 --> 00:48.760
just so I don't have to do it.

00:48.760 --> 00:52.040
I cut up some shallots and tomatoes for my focaccia

00:52.040 --> 00:54.540
and then decided to set the table.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.680
We went with something really simple and romantic today.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.240
At this point,

00:58.240 --> 01:00.560
my focaccia was ready to get dimpled.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.780
So I put some olive oil on top,

01:03.040 --> 01:06.320
dimpled it, then I spread some Calabrian chili oil,

01:06.320 --> 01:09.400
some pesto on top my shallots and tomatoes.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.440
Pop that in the oven

01:10.440 --> 01:14.260
while lucky decided to dry some arugula salad for us.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.120
I made a quick lemon olive oil vinaigrette

01:17.120 --> 01:19.780
and also topped My salad with Parmesan

01:19.960 --> 01:22.640
and some pickled shallots that I made earlier,

01:22.640 --> 01:25.900
I set that aside and made my pasta.

01:26.000 --> 01:26.680
I cut it up

01:26.680 --> 01:30.000
and then ran it through my pasta attachment a few times

01:30.000 --> 01:31.800
before deciding on a pasta shape,

01:31.800 --> 01:33.040
which was fettuccine.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.160
Today, after all my pasta was done,

01:35.160 --> 01:36.920
I pulled out my focaccia bread,

01:36.920 --> 01:39.680
cut it up, and moved on to the last step,

01:39.680 --> 01:41.200
which was boiling the pasta

01:41.200 --> 01:43.500
and assembling it with the sauce.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.640
This came together so beautifully.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.920
I set the table, obviously

01:47.920 --> 01:51.140
needed some balsamic and olive oil for the bread,

01:51.440 --> 01:52.520
played at the pasta,

01:52.520 --> 01:54.400
topped it with some Parmesan cheese,

01:54.400 --> 01:56.449
and we had a little date night.
