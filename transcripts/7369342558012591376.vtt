00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.840
If you think dishes in the shower is bad,

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:04.121
did I ever tell you about the time that I pissed in a bucket

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:06.141
for a week when I was nine months pregnant?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.880
And hindsight,

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:09.241
that project might have been a bit of a piss poor decision.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:12.721
And I know on TikTok, I always have a project with a crazy deadline,

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:14.161
but it's not just on TikTok.

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:16.081
Like these are genuinely and authentically

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.201
the types of situations I find myself in across my life.

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:20.681
And I don't know why. Okay,

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:21.841
so it's about six years ago,

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:23.401
I had a six year old and a four year old

00:00:23.402 --> 00:00:25.561
and I was heavily pregnant with baby girl.

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:28.561
And I had said to my husband that I wasn't gonna do another baby

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:31.001
in our current bathroom. We didn't have a bathtub.

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.081
I really wanted a tub.

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:34.521
I wanted to soak my old lady pregnant bones in the tub.

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:35.761
I wanted to bath with the baby.

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:36.681
I wanted to bath the baby

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.121
and I just I wanted a tub.

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:40.281
For context, we had spent the previous two years

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:42.441
like slowly renovating that little house

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.001
and it was time to do the bathroom.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.561
And there's nothing like some crazy

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:49.281
nesting hormones to make you tackle an impossible project on your own.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:50.961
And in typical Britain Mart fashion,

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:54.081
we had a crazy deadline. We had two weeks to get it done.

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:56.201
And that was because those two weeks for the school holidays.

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:58.601
So we thought we could Palm our children off to the grandparents

00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:00.081
for at least a good chunk of that time

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:02.321
so that we could do all of the things that we needed to do

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:04.961
to make this bathroom happen before the baby arrived

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:07.041
and because our house at the time was quite little

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:08.961
we only had the one bathroom

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:12.321
but the reality of that was that once the toilet was gone

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.241
the toilet was gone

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:16.161
and I don't know how much you know about um pregnant people

00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:18.961
but we we pee a lot we don't pee a lot in volume

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:20.741
but we pee a lot in frequency

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.040
and I can't believe I'm telling you this

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.721
I I put a bucket in a cupboard

00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:28.521
and when I would get up in the night and need to pee

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:32.201
I would go and use the bucket and if I needed to go number two's

00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:35.121
I would drive to the local gas station look

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:37.561
this is probably information you don't need to know about me

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:39.001
but now you know but anyway

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.561
we got the bathroom done before the baby arrived cause you know

00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:44.941
babies are notoriously very judgemental about things like bathrooms

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.720
and now when I'm doing my dishes in the shower

00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:50.241
and I'm not in the shower while I'm doing the dishes

00:01:50.242 --> 00:01:52.401
by the way people asking that on my last video

00:01:52.402 --> 00:01:54.001
I'm I'm doing them in the shower

00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:57.841
but I'm not also having a shower although that would be efficient

00:01:57.842 --> 00:02:00.201
but while I'm doing them I'm Reminding myself that at least

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:02.125
I don't have to piss in a fucking bucket.
