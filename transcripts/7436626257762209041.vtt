00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Do you think of Trump winning the US election?

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.480
Do you wanna know? I'll go first

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:06.241
because I think that you should shut up as a man about this

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:10.581
cause I don't think that men really understand the true impact

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.520
of how it feels. And I don't really think it matters on a global scale

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:18.101
because I think that either party is gonna commit genocide.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.440
But I do think

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:23.361
the most troubling aspect to me is the message it sends to men.

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:26.241
The message it sends to men is if you're a rapist,

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:27.241
if you're liable

00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:30.161
and have been held liable in civil court for sexual assault,

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:33.401
that you can become one of the most powerful men in the world.

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:36.641
We've seen on Twitter the last few days what that has created,

00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:38.821
which is men saying, your body,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.120
my choice. A man saying,

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:44.161
I saw a woman crossing the road in front of me while I was driving

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:47.521
and I put my foot down on the accelerator because rights,

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:49.192
you don't have them anymore as a woman.
