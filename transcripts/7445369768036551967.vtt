00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.400
The content creators that I feel are so fucking valuable right now

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:09.441
are the child free women who are posting about their life.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:13.481
Because as a child of 80s and elder millennial,

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:15.241
I didn't feel like I had an option.

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:18.521
I felt like the only way I was gonna be happy was if I had kids.

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:20.601
And so I had kids. Um,

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:23.781
I had four kids. And

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.200
I didn't have an example of happy child free women.

00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:31.761
I had child free women in my life.

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:33.001
My godmother's child free.

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:38.841
The reason she's my godmother is because my mother felt so bad for her

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:40.741
that she couldn't have children

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.480
that she made her my godmother

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:45.121
so that maybe she could share the gift of motherhood with her.

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:48.201
And that woman was not. I haven't talked to her in like,

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:50.001
I don't even know when's the last time I talked to her,

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:50.881
when she didn't give a fuck.

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.201
Like there was nothing you could give her

00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:55.021
that was gonna fill that hole of motherhood.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.260
And I just wish more women truly understood

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.080
that motherhood is not all that is fucking cracked up to be.

00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:06.881
It's not Fucking Pinterest.

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:12.261
And I'm not saying that like I'm some fucking pink tote mom. As,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.120
as far as my children know,

00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:15.601
they are my whole entire world.

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:18.761
I love them, I give them everything that I can.

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:20.001
I, you know what I mean?

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:21.141
Like, it's not

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.480
some Nurse Hannah situation over here.

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:25.761
It's just the reality.

00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:28.721
That motherhood is not all that it's cracked up to be.

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.481
It's not all that people make it out to be.

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:31.421
It's not.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.000
For as rewarding as it is,

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.601
it's also that painful, it hurts.

00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:37.401
There's.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.760
There's also stress. It's just.

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:42.461
It's not Pinterest. It's not what you thought it was.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.960
And it's important to see that

00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:48.281
you absolutely can be happy without having children.

00:01:48.282 --> 00:01:51.601
You don't have to have children to be happy.

00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:53.001
You also don't have to have children

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.881
to have the love of children in your life.

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:57.421
I have several friends in my life that are child free

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.260
and they babysit my kids or they come over or whatever, and,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.400
you know, they get the experience of children

00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:06.521
and the children are way more excited to see them

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:09.961
cause they usually have way cooler stories to tell them than me,

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:15.461
their mom. So to all the women who are producing content,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.500
child free content, your voice is so valuable.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.300
And thank you.
