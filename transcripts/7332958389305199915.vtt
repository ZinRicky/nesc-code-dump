00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.820
I got the heated electric lunch box

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.320
from the TikTok shop,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.840
and this is how it comes.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.280
So it comes with a little cooler bag

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.620
so you can keep your food

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.220
cold until it's time to reheat it.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.160
I thought it was more like a crock pot.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.940
Like, it would keep the food.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.000
I could warm the food and it would keep it warm,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.060
but that's not what it is.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.880
Your food is gonna be cold as the staple,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.640
then you have to be able to heat it up right away.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.320
So this isn't good for kids in school,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.580
which I thought it would be,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.220
but it is good for a mom who doesn't wanna have to,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.120
you know, always buy food when you're out.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.560
You could keep your own fucking yummy

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.200
cooked food that you made nice and ready to go,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.040
and then just plug it in your car when it's time to eat,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.280
or plug it in your office or wherever you're at.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.560
So I do really like it.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.500
Has a huge capacity.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.240
Like, there's no way I need that much fucking.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.300
That's a lot of fucking food.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.420
So I do really like it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.600
It was just different than I thought it would be.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.520
And here comes the little Chargers.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.860
But he has its own little key.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.560
I got, like it.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.320
If you want to order one,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.360
the link is right here.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.780
It's definitely okay. Ish.
