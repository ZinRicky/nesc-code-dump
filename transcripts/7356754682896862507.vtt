00:00.200 --> 00:04.520
Okay, so today I'm gonna be going over the whole prenup question

00:04.521 --> 00:06.661
slash comment I get on my page a lot.

00:06.880 --> 00:13.720
And this is kind of related to the backup question and why I don't, um,

00:13.721 --> 00:16.321
really promote a backup here on my channel,

00:16.322 --> 00:18.401
but mainly in my personal marriage.

00:18.402 --> 00:19.701
Um, if you.

00:20.040 --> 00:21.840
Whatever you guys do in your marriage,

00:21.841 --> 00:22.821
go for it.

00:22.840 --> 00:26.840
But today I'm gonna be talking about why I do not have a prenup

00:26.841 --> 00:28.161
or any sort of,

00:28.162 --> 00:29.481
I guess you could say,

00:29.482 --> 00:31.921
backup plan aside from life insurance.

00:31.922 --> 00:34.261
I am a big advocate for that.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.520
But anyways, we're gonna get into that in this video.

00:36.521 --> 00:38.861
So I'm just gonna say this right off the bat.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.260
I trust my husband.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.440
I know. Shocker. Shocker, right?

00:42.441 --> 00:44.441
Yes. That's the man I chose to marry.

00:44.442 --> 00:46.601
I got to know him very well.

00:46.602 --> 00:49.221
I know my husband's character inside and out,

00:49.320 --> 00:50.160
and I trust him

00:50.161 --> 00:50.961
to the point where

00:50.962 --> 00:53.001
I would have never asked my husband

00:53.002 --> 00:54.801
for a prenup before we got married.

00:54.802 --> 00:58.761
In fact, I'm pretty sure he would have taken that kind of as an insult,

00:58.762 --> 01:00.241
um, that I don't trust him,

01:00.242 --> 01:03.641
and I'm not confident in my decision to marry him.

01:03.642 --> 01:09.801
In fact, I think prenups make divorce nicer, in a way.

01:09.802 --> 01:14.281
So these couples get together, and they prepare for the worst.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.601
They don't want the worst.

01:15.602 --> 01:18.401
Nobody gets married just to get married.

01:18.402 --> 01:20.661
I think most people get married for love.

01:20.800 --> 01:24.260
Um, but when people Put prenups together.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.160
They are thinking,

01:25.161 --> 01:26.401
well, if worse comes to worse,

01:26.402 --> 01:31.421
let's at least make this worse outcome better for both of us.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.940
I don't see the point in making divorce

01:34.160 --> 01:38.360
better and more desirable in any way whatsoever.

01:38.361 --> 01:40.701
Therefore, I don't promote, um,

01:41.840 --> 01:43.480
prenups on my channel.

01:43.481 --> 01:46.021
Um, I don't know if that's crazy to you guys.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.000
As I've said before,

01:47.001 --> 01:50.841
I do believe life insurance is very wise for couples to get.

01:50.842 --> 01:53.641
Whether you are in a traditional marriage or a more modern

01:53.642 --> 01:54.881
fifty fifty marriage,

01:54.882 --> 01:56.941
life insurance does prepare

01:57.160 --> 02:00.240
both the husband and the wife for the worst case scenario.

02:00.241 --> 02:04.541
Another comment I see regarding this whole just in case backup idea

02:04.680 --> 02:06.960
is from other traditional wives,

02:06.961 --> 02:09.841
and they say that they will actually store money,

02:09.842 --> 02:12.681
like, hide money away from their husband just in case,

02:12.682 --> 02:15.141
like grocery money or whatever it might be.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.800
And I think that is completely wrong.

02:17.801 --> 02:21.521
I don't think women should be hiding money away from their husbands.

02:21.522 --> 02:22.781
That's deceitful.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.800
Do not plant the seeds of deceit in your marriage at any point in time,

02:27.801 --> 02:30.621
because those sprouts will grow.

02:30.880 --> 02:34.580
And hiding money away from your husband as a just in case,

02:34.680 --> 02:40.000
in my head, that's kind of like you are investing in your own divorce,

02:40.001 --> 02:42.001
the destruction of your marriage.

02:42.002 --> 02:43.841
Um, I don't want to think about that.

02:43.842 --> 02:44.921
I don't, um,

02:44.922 --> 02:46.361
entertain those thoughts in my head.

02:46.362 --> 02:51.521
In fact, my husband and I actually have a funny rule in our Um, marriage.

02:51.522 --> 02:53.841
We don't use the D word,

02:53.842 --> 02:55.161
which is divorce.

02:55.162 --> 02:57.161
Like, we won't talk about it.

02:57.162 --> 02:59.401
We've had this agreement. It.

02:59.402 --> 03:01.241
We just pretend it doesn't exist.

03:01.242 --> 03:04.721
But we live in a culture that divorce is very normal.

03:04.722 --> 03:07.041
A lot of people my age,

03:07.042 --> 03:09.281
I'm 26, have divorced parents.

03:09.282 --> 03:12.221
Both my husband and I have divorced parents.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.160
And we live in this culture where it's so normalized.

03:15.161 --> 03:16.761
But personally,

03:16.762 --> 03:18.241
this is just my opinion.

03:18.242 --> 03:19.341
With my marriage,

03:19.640 --> 03:21.920
I would never, ever,

03:21.921 --> 03:22.921
ever think about divorce.

03:22.922 --> 03:25.361
I would do what it takes to stay with my husband.

03:25.362 --> 03:28.581
And I know my husband is the exact same way.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.920
This is one of the negative outcomes from social media,

03:31.921 --> 03:32.881
in my opinion.

03:32.882 --> 03:36.761
We are watching millions of people live millions of different lives

03:36.762 --> 03:38.541
with millions of different outcomes,

03:38.560 --> 03:40.960
and it is scaring people into thinking,

03:40.961 --> 03:43.181
like, all these crazy scenarios.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.600
Do you know how many people wish that I will get hit by my husband

03:47.601 --> 03:50.241
or that I get divorced and cheated on?

03:50.242 --> 03:52.401
I get these comments on a daily basis.

03:52.402 --> 03:54.361
And you wanna know something?

03:54.362 --> 03:56.921
I pray for my marriage every single day.

03:56.922 --> 03:59.401
My husband prays for a marriage every single day.

03:59.402 --> 04:01.241
I pray for my husband individually,

04:01.242 --> 04:03.161
just like I pray for myself individually,

04:03.162 --> 04:04.821
and my husband does the same.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.020
The power of prayer is real.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.820
It protects you with the blood of Jesus Christ.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.420
The enemy wants to ruin your marriage.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.106
Protect your marriage with prayer.
