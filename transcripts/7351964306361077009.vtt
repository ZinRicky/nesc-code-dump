00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.600
Good morning. I'm coming at you from my extremely clean bedroom

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:05.161
basically. Long story short,

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:05.681
yesterday

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:09.241
I kinda lost the plot and ended up organising my entire bedroom

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.881
and all of my clothes and even painting my wardrobe

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:16.561
which wasn't on my bingo card for yesterday or Eva really. Anyway,

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:18.241
so it's been about a month since I got my hair done.

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:20.681
I think we went for a gloss and a tone and we went darker

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:22.401
but it has faded heaps

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:25.161
so we're going back in and I don't know what I'm gonna get done today

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:29.181
but hopefully whatever it is it's giving so let's go.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.920
So this is our before and excuse me for not putting any makeup on,

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:35.281
I just didn't have time today

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:39.881
the brief is dimension cause at the moment it's looking a little flat

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:41.741
so we're gonna do some brightness,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.560
some belly arch and hopefully

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:46.761
I'll come out of here looking and feeling like a new woman

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:47.681
are you even a girl

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:51.221
unless you've got three beverages on the girl at once?

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.300
Hey, it feels a bit more like me.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.480
I just realised I failed to finish that vlog off properly

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:07.481
and I'm sorry about it

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:09.681
so here I am looking like an absolute fucking mess

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:11.841
a couple of days later because I am balls deep

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:13.681
and another project with a tight deep line

00:01:13.682 --> 00:01:15.441
and please don't ask me, okay,

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.641
why these happen because I don't know.

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:19.201
Here's the hair few days later

00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:20.281
I'm enjoying The lightness,

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:22.641
enjoying the brightness. I feel like now when I look in the mirror,

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:25.041
I just see what I think I look like.

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:27.001
But when it was darker, I was always like, whoa,

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:28.681
who the fuck's that? Do you know what I mean?

00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:30.521
Feel free to let me know what you like better,

00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:32.241
the night or the dark. In the meantime,

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:35.081
have a beautiful Easter, eat lots of Chuckies guilt free,

00:01:35.082 --> 00:01:36.161
spend time with your family

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.503
and I will see you with a project update as soon as I possibly can.
