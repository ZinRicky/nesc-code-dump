Sharing some of my favorite big sister tips slash advice.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.080
No. 1 if you're dating a guy

00:07.081 --> 00:09.741
and you're confused about the way he feels about you,

00:10.680 --> 00:13.900
cut it off. Ended he does not like you,

00:13.920 --> 00:17.220
don't waste any more of your time and move on.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.240
Men are not complicated at all.

00:19.241 --> 00:21.081
They usually know immediately

00:21.082 --> 00:22.881
whether or not they are attracted to a girl

00:22.882 --> 00:25.041
and like her. And if you are dating,

00:25.042 --> 00:28.981
it will take a man practically no time to fall in love with you

00:29.000 --> 00:31.660
if he's going to fall in love with you.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.540
If you are in a situationship,

00:33.680 --> 00:37.000
it is time to grow up and step away from that.

00:37.001 --> 00:39.761
Situationships are not real relationships

00:39.762 --> 00:44.081
and they most of the time end and nothing happens with them.

00:44.082 --> 00:46.081
They're just a waste of time.

00:46.082 --> 00:50.501
Survey after survey shows men prefer dresses over pants.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.540
Take that information how you would.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.040
However, if you're sitting there thinking well,

00:56.041 --> 00:58.021
why would I care what a man thinks?

00:58.280 --> 01:00.280
You might want to re evaluate that mindset.

01:00.281 --> 01:04.541
Especially if you are married or you wish to be married.

01:04.680 --> 01:07.520
Now that doesn't mean a pair of pants can't be feminine.

01:07.521 --> 01:09.441
That is so far from the truth.

01:09.442 --> 01:13.841
However, my favorite thing about dresses is that all you need is one

01:13.842 --> 01:15.041
clothing garment

01:15.042 --> 01:17.521
and you can style it up with jewelry,

01:17.522 --> 01:22.981
hair, accessories. And you just can't be a beautiful feminine dress.

01:23.280 --> 01:28.020
No. 3 if you are eating this and you are constantly hungry

01:28.040 --> 01:30.580
and You think you just have a big stomach?

01:30.920 --> 01:32.440
Stop eating this.

01:32.441 --> 01:36.361
This non fat, zero calorie sweetener,

01:36.362 --> 01:40.801
artificially flavored yogurt does not do anything for you.

01:40.802 --> 01:43.181
If you want something that's actually gonna fill you up,

01:43.200 --> 01:48.220
throw that junk out and swap it for a good quality whole milk yogurt.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.180
Bonus points if you get the one with the cream on top.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.920
Why yes, it is over double the amount of calories.

01:54.921 --> 01:58.241
However, this kind of fat is so good for you,

01:58.242 --> 02:00.141
especially if it is good quality.

02:00.400 --> 02:04.540
And I don't know when fat suddenly became something bad.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.260
And if you want it to be flavored,

02:06.320 --> 02:08.040
flavor it with real fruit,

02:08.041 --> 02:09.621
not artificial fruit.

02:09.920 --> 02:10.980
You want it sweet,

02:11.160 --> 02:13.140
use maple syrup or honey.

02:13.320 --> 02:19.020
No. 4. If happy wife, happy life has a place in your marriage.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.840
Stop that. Stop that.

02:24.841 --> 02:28.141
That puts the wife on a pedestal

02:28.600 --> 02:32.600
and it prioritizes the wife's needs and wants above the husbands.

02:32.601 --> 02:34.981
And that is not how marriage works.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.100
Happy husband,

02:36.840 --> 02:39.260
happy wife, happy life.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.560
And lastly, number five,

02:41.561 --> 02:43.321
if you are ever feeling down,

02:43.322 --> 02:45.281
something has just got you sad.

02:45.282 --> 02:46.701
I have this method.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.500
Go outside in the sunlight.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.440
Or even if it's raining or snowing, whatever,

02:52.441 --> 02:55.641
just go outside and feel the weather,

02:55.642 --> 02:56.601
feel the elements,

02:56.602 --> 02:58.021
feel the fresh air.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.580
Come inside.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.880
Um, eat something,

03:01.881 --> 03:02.841
something you enjoy.

03:02.842 --> 03:03.801
But that is healthy.

03:03.802 --> 03:06.921
Maybe it's fruit with dark chocolate on top. Or, um,

03:06.922 --> 03:11.601
a smoothie. Just something you enjoy and disconnect from technology.

03:11.602 --> 03:12.881
No TV in the background,

03:12.882 --> 03:14.501
no music and headphones.

03:14.640 --> 03:18.460
No news. And just take a step back.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.660
This will resent to you.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.160
And it has worked so many times for me.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.241
Um, so, yeah,

03:24.242 --> 03:27.021
definitely give that a shot if you are ever feeling down.

03:27.400 --> 03:31.960
So those are my 5 big sister tips slash advice.

03:31.961 --> 03:32.961
And this is really fun.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.401
I really wanna do it again.

03:34.402 --> 03:36.166
And I hope you enjoy. Bye.
