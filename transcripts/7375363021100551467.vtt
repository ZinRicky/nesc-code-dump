00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.040
this is certain sentiment among women sometimes like oh

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.360
I'm not like other girls

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:05.160
I can do all these things

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:08.120
when it's like that in and of itself is like

00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:11.880
slightly misogynistic and a real pick me girl spirit

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.840
like it's totally okay to be like other women

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:15.680
other women know how to change a tire too

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.360
other women you know

00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:19.680
fucking drink beer and watch baseball or football

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.160
or whatever the fuck it is that you're into that you think it's like

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:23.320
I'm not like other girls

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:24.680
I'm not like other girls

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:25.960
I would pick the man

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:27.160
I wouldn't pick the bear

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:30.020
like shut the fuck up okay

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.120
you're so fucking unique and cool

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:33.920
like is that what you wanted

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:38.880
it just it breaks down the camaraderie that women can build

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:42.880
when you have to be different and better than other women

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:44.080
like just sit the fuck down

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:46.860
we're just can we all just fucking vibe

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.380
can we fucking vibe
