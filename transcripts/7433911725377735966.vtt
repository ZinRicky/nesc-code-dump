00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:03.906
to help extend the life of the filters you use with your CPAP machine

00:00:03.907 --> 00:00:07.526
if you place an air purifier right below it

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:11.186
it's gonna clean the air that's getting fed straight into your CPAP machine

00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:15.066
so it's not like I'm trying to purify all the air in the whole entire room

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:17.826
I'm just trying to make sure that where the CPAP is placed

00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:23.026
it's kind of like getting fed the cleanest air so that it's easier on the CPAP

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:24.866
and other people on the internet have talked about this

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:27.426
it really is helpful I got this one from the TikTok shop

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.506
I really really like it

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:31.306
it's really helpful it has a child lock

00:00:31.307 --> 00:00:34.766
so little fingers are not gonna come and accidentally turn it off

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:39.106
and it has a timer so just right before you turn the C pop machine on

00:00:39.107 --> 00:00:40.826
you hit the timer button

00:00:40.827 --> 00:00:43.226
to make sure that it's only gonna run for the eight hours

00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:44.386
it's really quiet

00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:51.381
and it really does help the C pop machine at be as effective as it can be

00:00:51.487 --> 00:00:54.127
because it's not working hard to clean the air

00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:56.607
and the filter in here is only one little layer of Protection

00:00:56.608 --> 00:01:02.327
so this really does add another layer of Protection for breathing all night long

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:06.127
like this is the air that's getting shoved down your airway all night long

00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:08.607
so I like to make sure it's as clean as possible

00:01:08.608 --> 00:01:09.847
cause it's for my daughter

00:01:09.848 --> 00:01:10.364
and she's you know
