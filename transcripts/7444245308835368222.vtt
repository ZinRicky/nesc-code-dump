00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.160
I was just doing what everyone else was doing. Partying,

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:04.401
vaping, drinking,

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:06.441
watching TV, eating fast food.

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:07.921
And I took hormonal birth control.

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:11.361
And to no one's surprise, I ran into a lot of health issues,

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:13.641
and I lost my period at 19.

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:17.441
Doctors said I was too. Too young to be concerned about my fertility,

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:19.601
and their only solution was birth control.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.701
And then it dawned on me. I didn't need more pharmaceuticals.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.280
I needed nature. I needed sunshine.

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:27.561
I needed real foods from the earth.

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:30.761
I needed to replenish all the minerals that I had depleted

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:32.401
when I just didn't know any better.

00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:36.281
I needed to stop trying to chemically force my body into submission.

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:39.201
Artificially trying to replicate nature gets us nowhere.

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:42.201
And the reality of the female physiology is that it.

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:44.281
It thrives in a state of abundance.

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:47.601
And if we're living in a depleted or chronically stressed state,

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:49.401
that means that we're burning through minerals,

00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:51.961
and we need to consciously rebuild a surplus.

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:54.281
Because having an abundance of resources

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:56.361
tells your body that it's safe to ovulate.

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:58.261
And this is called vitality.
