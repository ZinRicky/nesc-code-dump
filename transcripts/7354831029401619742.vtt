00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.740
so I don't do

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.480
but I do collect things

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:06.161
and I love collecting like

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:08.801
little vintage containers and also a lot of Sterling silver

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:13.841
so in that I have a lot of fun little containers that if I did do

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:15.881
that I would put it in

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.021
I just wanted to show you

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.320
so first of all

00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:19.741
I have this this is um

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.520
like the first thing that I got that I was like

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:23.161
oh this is

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:23.841
if I did that

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:24.701
I would do that

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.880
I use it for perfume

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:28.801
um so this is like a poison uh

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:29.481
a poison ring

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:31.521
and I got this in New Orleans um

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:32.641
there's like a Hurricane in Florida

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:33.441
and we had to drive

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:35.201
and currently I just keep like

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.041
this is really old

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:37.481
um I haven't used this in a while

00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:38.841
but I currently keep um

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:40.481
like a little cotton pad with some oil

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:41.081
so like

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.121
when I move around

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:44.261
like fragrance oil and it's like perfume

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.920
but if I did this would be a great place to put it

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:47.441
okay also

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:48.681
I recently got this

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.721
and this is a Sterling silver needle holder

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:53.181
like for sewing needles

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.520
I when I bought this

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.361
thought this was much bigger

00:00:56.362 --> 00:01:00.421
because I thought that it would be good to hold a cigarette uh

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.400
but it much smaller than I anticipated

00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:03.921
it has like

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:04.721
a little thing

00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:05.921
so tell me that would be like

00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:07.561
a cute little necklace

00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:09.561
and if I did this would be

00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:11.641
you know this would be really perfect

00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:13.621
um I just cleaned it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.960
all of this came off this little thing anyways

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:18.921
so there's this

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:20.181
then I have a couple of these

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.480
Estee Lauder vintage

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.201
like um

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:24.961
solid perfume holders um

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:26.761
and so they have like these little

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:29.301
like little amber um

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.360
like perfumes and they're awesome

00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:32.561
um I would put a little

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:34.701
little baggy in here personally

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.940
like I just like it would be so cun ty

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.540
and there's this um

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.240
Estee Lauder has like a bunch of these

00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:44.441
I also have a pendant one

00:01:44.442 --> 00:01:45.121
here's the pendant

00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:46.041
it's just the same concept

00:01:46.042 --> 00:01:47.747
like a little amber perfume solid perfume 

00:01:47.748 --> 00:01:48.601
also I have this like

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:52.921
little pearl cage which I could definitely put my antidepressants

00:01:52.922 --> 00:01:54.301
and I think that would be cute

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.140
wellbutrin 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.120
and I also have this

00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:58.501
I don't know if you can see it

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.740
this like comes out and then this opens up

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.300
I'm sorry literally what other purpose would I have for this

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.700
empty space what else am I putting in here literally

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.760
what is the point of this

00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:20.301
you know what the point of this is

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.680
ah what

00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:23.641
so tell me what I should be putting in here

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:24.343
cause I'm obviouslyâ€”

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:25.081
 I have enough issues

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:25.681
I don't do that

00:02:25.682 --> 00:02:27.121
like I think I would go like

00:02:27.122 --> 00:02:28.161
I have ADHD also

00:02:28.162 --> 00:02:29.041
so like I just

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:30.161
you know like

00:02:30.162 --> 00:02:31.681
my medication is literally meth(amphetamine, aka adderal) right

00:02:31.682 --> 00:02:35.081
so like I don't think I need to be adding anything else to the mix

00:02:35.082 --> 00:02:36.641
you know um

00:02:36.642 --> 00:02:37.441
so

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.320
but like if you guys have any ideas for like

00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:41.281
what I can hide in these

00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:42.341
like little like

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.840
like you're joking

00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:44.601
like what else

00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:46.321
this be for I don't know

00:02:46.322 --> 00:02:47.401
I like little trinkets

00:02:47.402 --> 00:02:48.981
and for some reason

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.480
a lot of little trinkets just have secret like

00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:54.181
places to store things

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.840
I'm only a person

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:57.141
what am I supposed to what

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.840
what conclusion am I supposed to come to anyways

00:02:59.841 --> 00:03:03.021
this is the consequence of hyperfixating on buying Sterling silver on eBay

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.200
and I'm not gonna stop

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:05.881
I am addicted

00:03:05.882 --> 00:03:06.521
I also have this

00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:07.121
is it um

00:03:07.122 --> 00:03:09.801
800 silvers is like vintage and a vintage silver compact

00:03:09.802 --> 00:03:11.701
it's 800 silvers is not Sterling silver

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.720
and this comes out

00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:13.201
so I just like

00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:15.461
put it in here and like

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.340
you know just like

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.600
handle it and the most of this would be like

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:23.241
this would be my like

00:03:23.242 --> 00:03:25.141
go to ha ha

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.240
it's this little perfume container and I'm gonna use

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.681
I have a perfume oil again

00:03:29.682 --> 00:03:33.561
that I use I always basically smell like rose and baby powder cause I have this

00:03:33.562 --> 00:03:34.641
like one um

00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:36.121
like rose oil

00:03:36.122 --> 00:03:37.361
and it's again

00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:38.681
this is for perfume

00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:40.981
but like is it for perfume

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.860
is that what it was intended for

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.900
I don't know that's what I'm gonna use it for because

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.540
that's what I'm gonna use it for

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.680
and I'm gonna have it hanging on

00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:53.721
like a little necklace

00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:54.881
but like if

00:03:54.882 --> 00:03:56.121
tell me this wouldn't be like

00:03:56.122 --> 00:03:59.121
the perfect use anyways

00:03:59.122 --> 00:03:59.921
I just like

00:03:59.922 --> 00:04:01.521
I spend a lot of time on eBay

00:04:01.522 --> 00:04:02.921
and I spend a lot of time like

00:04:02.922 --> 00:04:04.721
looking at vintage sterling silver stuff

00:04:04.722 --> 00:04:05.801
and they just like

00:04:05.802 --> 00:04:07.698
they made a lot of stuff 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.141
for sn uff and like

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.680
they're so cool

00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:11.621
but I just like

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.560
I have no use for that

00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:14.001
so I just like

00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:15.321
I'm like what am I gonna make these like

00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:16.621
little tiny containers for

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.942
anyways that's my show and tell
