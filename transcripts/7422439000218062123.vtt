00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.600
yeah we need to talk about this

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:02.800
I'm so glad you bring it up

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.120
okay so in November

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.240
Florida residents are going to be able to vote in a ballot initiative

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:08.600
to protect abortion rights

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:09.840
in their state constitution

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:12.800
Republicans know that Americans in red states and in blue states

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:14.920
overwhelmingly support abortion access

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:16.880
they generally hate ballot initiatives

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:20.080
they do not want the issue of abortion to be in voters hands

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:23.600
they managed to stick some really gross language onto this ballot initiative

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:25.360
in a financial impact statement

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:27.160
telling Florida residents

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:31.640
that this initiative would result in fewer live earths in Florida per year

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:34.760
and at that may have a negative financial impact on the state

00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:36.800
right off the bat they're literally just saying um

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:40.980
reproductive rights hinders our ability to control women's reproduction

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.720
which hinders our ability to capitalize on their unpaid reproductive labor

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.440
gross but it's also just completely wrong

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:49.560
to the extent that you're gonna put a financial impact statement

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:51.120
it should say something like

00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:55.640
forcing families to birth children that they already have told you

00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:59.440
that they can't afford has devastating financial impacts for families

00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:00.720
are also just completely wrong

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:02.280
and trying to trick voters into thinking that

00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.960
but denying abortions equals more babies

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:06.680
research shows it doesn't

00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:08.120
men who are denied a wanted abortion

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:11.320
are much less likely to have a planned pregnancy later on

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.520
let's use an example let's say we have Emma and Sam

00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:15.720
who are both pregnant and wants an abortion

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.580
Emma receives one Sam does not

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.920
Emma is much more likely to have planned pregnancies later off

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:26.520
Sam is not so Emma may go on to have three children

00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.640
whereas Emma only has one

00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:31.960
so they're trying to suggest to voters that if you deny women wanted abortions

00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:35.040
we will see a nut increase in the state's population

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:36.680
and that's completely incorrect

00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:40.020
the whole thing is literally so gross and ignorant and awful
