00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
Let's talk about fashion and beauty

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:04.421
as it pertains to political and social signaling.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.760
So we've been deep diving about the beauty standard on my page,

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:08.041
and I wanted to take it a step further,

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:09.641
or at least pivot to a different subject.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.821
All together, but within the same wheelhouse.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.920
And that's how you present yourself

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.921
and how that signals to other people

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:18.041
you're positioning within the social stratosphere

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:19.521
and the class system. Now,

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:20.801
I've made it no secret on my page

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:22.321
that I grew up in a very wealthy area

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.841
in the suburbs of New York City.

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:27.621
Okay. There was definitely a archetype for dressing,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.800
presenting yourself as I was growing up,

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:34.641
and I still live in a very wealthy or affluent suburban area.

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:38.001
And there is a uniform for the women around here and the men.

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.521
But we're gonna dive into women because that's where I land.

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:42.921
The thing about appearance as a social signal is

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:44.721
the entire reason people do this

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:48.201
is to signify to each other who they are willing to associate with.

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:50.921
But these are subtle things the further in you get,

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.761
and an outsider would not know.

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:56.581
I did a whole video recently about the whole golden goose phenomenon,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.000
and it's expensive yet dirty looking for that reason.

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.281
It's supposed to give this illusion of authenticity

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:04.761
for people who don't know.

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:06.001
And the people who do know,

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:08.161
know you spent $700 on your sneakers,

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:10.761
that you're in the club. Or at least part of an Affluent,

00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:11.841
upper class. Now,

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:13.721
I have never particularly felt comfortable

00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:16.521
or fit in with the people that I am surrounded with,

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:18.681
which is why when I. Not just the only reason,

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:21.201
but one of the reasons why I went on a personal style journey.

00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:23.321
Because the signals that were being sent to me growing up

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:24.481
and still today in my adulthood

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:26.981
are not ones that I can copy and mimic effectively.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.720
It feels inauthentic to me.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.281
And I don't know if it's because I'm in the south

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:31.801
or because I'm in a conservative area,

00:01:31.802 --> 00:01:33.521
but blonde hair goes very,

00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:35.401
very much hand in hand with this.

00:01:35.402 --> 00:01:37.161
But not any blonde hair.

00:01:37.162 --> 00:01:39.801
We're talking about effortlessly done blonde hair.

00:01:39.802 --> 00:01:42.101
Blonde hair that looks like you just rolled off a beach.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.560
Blonde hair that is perfectly undone,

00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:48.121
yet slightly curly. That costs so much money.

00:01:48.122 --> 00:01:50.961
Someone would think that they have undone hair.

00:01:50.962 --> 00:01:54.521
They don't. It is very expensive to get your hair to look like that.

00:01:54.522 --> 00:01:56.681
But only somebody in the know would know that.

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:59.681
And that no makeup. Makeup look costs a lot of money.

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:01.081
Those products are expensive.

00:02:01.082 --> 00:02:02.601
And the skincare you have to do

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:05.121
in order to attain a perfect complexion,

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:07.241
without makeup or without makeup,

00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:10.440
is also very expensive, as is the facials,

00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:12.061
the Botox, the fillers,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.980
the lasers, the peels.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.640
There is a signifier of wealth and privilege

00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:18.441
that comes with the beauty standard.

00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:20.681
And again, I'm not taking myself out of that.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:21.161
I don't think

00:02:21.162 --> 00:02:24.161
There's anyone alive who can take themselves fully out of,

00:02:24.162 --> 00:02:26.481
like, knowing their place within the beauty standard

00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:28.081
or within the class system in this country.

00:02:28.082 --> 00:02:30.721
But social class is another subculture

00:02:30.722 --> 00:02:32.561
or sub genre of people

00:02:32.562 --> 00:02:34.401
with an appearance and a beauty standard

00:02:34.402 --> 00:02:38.801
that either admits people into the ranks or excludes them out of it.

00:02:38.802 --> 00:02:41.841
And this is why people are so fascinated with Anna Delvey

00:02:41.842 --> 00:02:43.621
and that entire situation.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.320
Because how did she gain access?

00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:49.781
How did she know the rules of the game without actually belonging?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.448
That's why people are making her famous, because it's real hard.
