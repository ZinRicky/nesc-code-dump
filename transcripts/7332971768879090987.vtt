00:00.120 --> 00:02.800
We're about to make the best roasted tomato soup

00:02.800 --> 00:04.480
with cheesy garlic bread.

00:04.480 --> 00:07.000
There's just nothing that beats that combination.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.640
So we're gonna start off by making some baguette. So

00:09.640 --> 00:12.940
I add my starter with all of my ingredients to my bowl

00:12.960 --> 00:15.940
and then give it a good knead in my stand mixer.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.400
When the dough is really sticky,

00:18.400 --> 00:20.800
I transfer it to a greased bowl

00:20.800 --> 00:23.020
just to rise for 45 minutes.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.280
After 45 minutes,

00:24.280 --> 00:25.640
I do stretch and folds,

00:25.640 --> 00:28.360
and then let it rest for another 45 minutes

00:28.360 --> 00:31.660
before I form my dough into three little balls.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.680
I then fold them over and form them into little logs

00:34.680 --> 00:38.060
before I put them aside for their final rise.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.160
In the meantime,

00:39.160 --> 00:40.680
I prep my tomato soup.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.280
So I get all of my tomatoes.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.880
I use a few different ones.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.500
I use heirloom tomatoes,

00:45.600 --> 00:46.680
some cherry tomatoes,

00:46.680 --> 00:48.040
and then tomatoes on the vine.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.680
I also had some purple carrots laying around,

00:50.680 --> 00:52.820
so I decided to add those as well.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.560
We can't forget about the onions and the garlic.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.400
And I sprinkle it with some olive oil,

00:57.400 --> 00:58.400
salt, pepper,

00:58.400 --> 00:59.840
and some Rosemary.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.200
While that's roasting in the oven,

01:01.200 --> 01:03.200
I get started on making my butter.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.480
Once my butter is separated from my buttermilk,

01:05.480 --> 01:07.840
I squeezed out all the liquid

01:07.840 --> 01:09.560
and then rinsed it in cold water,

01:09.560 --> 01:10.400
sliced it up,

01:10.400 --> 01:11.680
and put that aside.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.240
Then I swapped out my tomatoes in the oven

01:14.240 --> 01:15.620
for my baguette.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.880
And while those were baking,

01:16.880 --> 01:18.600
I blended Up my tomato soup

01:18.600 --> 01:20.800
and had to run it through a strainer

01:20.800 --> 01:22.400
just to get all the little bits out.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.480
And then I added some miso paste.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.020
Love the combination of miso and tomato.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.380
Then I took the roasted garlic,

01:29.440 --> 01:30.280
squeezed it out,

01:30.280 --> 01:31.320
added it to my butter

01:31.320 --> 01:33.600
alongside some parsley and flaky sea salt,

01:33.600 --> 01:36.040
and spread that all over our fresh baguettes,

01:36.040 --> 01:38.200
topped it with a good amount of cheese,

01:38.200 --> 01:39.800
and there we go.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.160
I was so excited to have this.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.080
There's nothing more comforting to me

01:44.080 --> 01:46.325
than cheesy garlic bread with tomato.
