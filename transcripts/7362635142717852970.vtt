00:00.160 --> 00:03.360
We're back at the Asian grocery store doing a little restock.

00:03.361 --> 00:04.841
It's one of our favourite places

00:04.842 --> 00:07.041
but we don't go a lot cause it's so far away.

00:07.042 --> 00:08.401
But today was the day!

00:08.402 --> 00:10.841
I always start in the produce section

00:10.842 --> 00:14.881
and always have to grab a papaya and stock up on some mushrooms.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.481
There's just something about all the produce.

00:16.482 --> 00:19.241
Today I decided to get some Thai chillies,

00:19.242 --> 00:22.481
Guylon, and some pre peeled garlic.

00:22.482 --> 00:24.281
I also needed some green onions,

00:24.282 --> 00:26.601
some bean sprouts, and some Napa cabbage.

00:26.602 --> 00:28.641
I usually get the stuff that I would need

00:28.642 --> 00:30.741
for some recipes I'm trying to make,

00:30.760 --> 00:33.440
so today I also decided to grab some tofu.

00:33.441 --> 00:35.561
Lucky's always in charge of the meat

00:35.562 --> 00:37.901
so he grabbed whatever he thought we needed.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.120
Skip the sodas today,

00:39.121 --> 00:42.441
just got some juice and then made it over to the ramen section.

00:42.442 --> 00:45.201
I don't usually eat ramen so lucky picked his favorites.

00:45.202 --> 00:48.681
And then I got some mi gorengue for my sister in law that was coming

00:48.682 --> 00:51.141
because I remember that she really liked these.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.200
We also got a small bag of rice

00:53.201 --> 00:55.481
and then made it over to grab some kimchi.

00:55.482 --> 00:57.521
I could have kimchi with every single meal.

00:57.522 --> 00:59.661
Especially with some sweet potato.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.240
Lucky grabbed some of his favorite pot stickers

01:02.241 --> 01:04.921
and we also got some gyoza for condiments.

01:04.922 --> 01:06.481
We kept it pretty simple today

01:06.482 --> 01:09.561
and I saw this pina colada that I knew lucky would like

01:09.562 --> 01:12.481
so I grabbed that for him and then we Checked out

01:12.482 --> 01:14.781
the total wasn't bad today at all.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.760
We made sure to only get the essentials.

01:16.761 --> 01:18.901
And then we saw this little game area

01:18.920 --> 01:22.338
and decided to win the kids a prize for heading home.
