00:00.080 --> 00:01.440
These are some things I prep

00:01.440 --> 00:03.680
to make my week just a little bit easier.

00:03.680 --> 00:07.300
I started off by making a blueberry lemon loaf.

00:07.320 --> 00:10.040
So I took some Greek yoghurt zest in my lemon,

00:10.040 --> 00:11.800
added some honey as my sweetener,

00:11.800 --> 00:14.140
some eggs to my liquid batter,

00:14.160 --> 00:16.360
and then added that to my dry batter.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.400
Give it a good mix,

00:17.400 --> 00:18.560
added some blueberries,

00:18.560 --> 00:20.140
and pop that in the oven.

00:20.160 --> 00:20.960
Once that was done,

00:20.960 --> 00:23.760
I let that cool while I started on my pickles.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.280
I was doing different pickles.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.560
I was doing a classic cucumber pickle with some garlic,

00:28.560 --> 00:29.880
bay leaves, dill,

00:29.880 --> 00:33.120
and then I also decided to just do my classic pickled

00:33.120 --> 00:35.000
onion that I do almost every week.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.040
I top that with some peppercorn

00:37.040 --> 00:38.980
and then my vinegar mixture,

00:39.320 --> 00:40.520
close my jar UPS

00:40.520 --> 00:45.020
and set those aside while I started on my granola bars.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.840
My kids are obsessed with these.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.200
I combine some honey with peanut butter

00:49.200 --> 00:52.040
and then add my oats and whatever toppings you like.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.040
I opted for white chocolate chips,

00:54.040 --> 00:55.400
some dried cranberries,

00:55.400 --> 00:56.160
some chia seeds,

00:56.160 --> 00:57.420
and flax seeds.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.520
I put those in the fridge for about an hour

00:59.520 --> 01:00.920
before slicing them up,

01:00.920 --> 01:04.080
and then I got started on my salad for the week.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.440
This week I wanted to go

01:05.440 --> 01:07.080
for something that is super filling

01:07.080 --> 01:07.920
but stores well,

01:07.920 --> 01:10.120
so I did some quinoa, kale,

01:10.120 --> 01:11.640
carrots, some feta,

01:11.640 --> 01:12.800
some cucumber,

01:12.800 --> 01:15.980
and top that with a miso lemon dressing.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.320
I like prepping one hot meal a week.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.700
Just Because I

01:19.720 --> 01:21.960
don't like eating the same meals over and over again,

01:21.960 --> 01:23.640
so I just do one hot meal,

01:23.640 --> 01:25.820
which this week was yaki udon.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.960
So we had some wagyu lying around.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.320
I added that to the pan,

01:29.320 --> 01:30.360
gave that a saute,

01:30.360 --> 01:31.120
pulled that out,

01:31.120 --> 01:33.320
and then sauteed all of my vegetables.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.160
Once those were done,

01:34.160 --> 01:36.240
I added my noodles and my sauce,

01:36.240 --> 01:37.680
gave that really good mix,

01:37.680 --> 01:39.020
and it was done.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.680
I like storing all of my food in glass containers

01:41.680 --> 01:45.920
if I can. So I put my granola bars back in the fridge,

01:45.920 --> 01:47.440
packed away my salad,

01:47.440 --> 01:49.360
and then moved on to my noodles.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.640
I didn't put the lid on

01:50.640 --> 01:52.520
because they were still pretty hot.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.540
And this wraps up my meal prep.
