00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
As a seasoned mother of four children,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.620
let me put you on.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.160
I keep these everywhere. In my car,

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.681
in my house, in my kids rooms,

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:11.601
in their bedroom. You don't know what it is?

00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:13.901
Let me tell you. It's called the Fucking Amethyst Bag.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.960
They usually come in packs of like 24.

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:20.781
You can puke in this and then you twist it,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840
and then it's got these little notches.

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:28.361
You can put it in the little notch and I'll throw it away.

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.721
So when your kid is puking,

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:31.201
they start puking in the car,

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:32.881
they start. I keep this in their bed.

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:35.201
So if my little kids start puking in the middle of the night

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.901
and they can't make it out of their bunk bed,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.260
they can just puke in here.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.080
And I don't got a deal with the fucking mess.

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:43.721
Or at least it minimizes it greatly.

00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:45.361
I know we're trying to reduce plastics,

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:47.421
but this one is a fucking lifesaver.
