00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
The state of Florida is trying to make that scene for Mean Girls

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:04.881
where the gym teacher puts a condom on a banana literally illegal.

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:07.321
They're completely overhauling their sex education system,

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:09.321
where they are banning all forms of sex ed,

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:11.121
including talking about menstruation or periods

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:12.401
before the age of 6th grade,

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.681
which is the age that most girls start getting their period.

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:18.021
Then after 6th grade, you are only allowed to talk about abstinence.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.940
You are not allowed to talk about different sex positions.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.160
You are not allowed to talk about contraception.

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:25.641
You are not allowed to show people images of human anatomy

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:29.141
in these classes. You also are not allowed to use the words abuse,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.440
consent, gender identity,

00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:33.361
or fluids. How are you gonna teach kids about STDs

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:34.781
if you can't say the word fluids?

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.760
Which might explain why

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.921
Florida has one of the highest rates of HIV in the entire country.

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:41.401
It is such a disservice and so devastating to me,

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:43.601
to all the millions of people who live in that state.

00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:46.521
Because we know that absence only programs do not work.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:49.541
Absence only programs lead to higher rates of unwanted teen pregnancy,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.760
higher rates of STDs,

00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:53.361
and higher rates of sexual abuse and domestic violence.

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:55.001
We know this. It's well studied.

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.681
And Ron Desantis does not care.

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:59.521
He also is the same guy who's trying to ban abortion the entire state.

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:00.561
And so you can't get an abortion,

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:02.681
but you also can't learn about a Condom. Like,

00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:05.120
the hypocrisy is so obvious and blatant,

00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:08.001
and it is so obvious that they literally don't care about it at all.

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:09.441
Which is why it's so, like,

00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:12.561
infuriating to know that this one governor is able to take, like,

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:14.561
this entire state from 2024 back to,

00:01:14.562 --> 00:01:15.721
like, 1950.

00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:17.001
It's absolutely insane to me.

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:18.241
And if you feel like it's insane, too,

00:01:18.242 --> 00:01:19.561
by the way, and you live in Florida,

00:01:19.562 --> 00:01:21.281
he is up for reelection in 2026,

00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:22.733
and you can vote him the fuck out.
