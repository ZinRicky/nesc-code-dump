Gut health is so important to me,

00:01.881 --> 00:06.061
which is why I started taking SEED a few years ago.

00:06.120 --> 00:09.120
This is the seed DSO one sinbiotic.

00:09.121 --> 00:13.521
Started looking into gut health when I struggled with having eczema.

00:13.522 --> 00:16.841
So I had really bad eczema for a few years,

00:16.842 --> 00:19.761
and one of the things that I knew was gonna help

00:19.762 --> 00:22.021
was figuring out my gut health.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.440
So then I looked into taking probiotics,

00:25.441 --> 00:27.241
and I found SEED,

00:27.242 --> 00:30.381
which is actually a pro and prebiotic,

00:30.480 --> 00:34.760
made such a difference in how my gut feels,

00:34.761 --> 00:37.301
which impacts my skin health as well.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.560
It also comes with this little travel size.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.121
I'm not traveling anytime soon,

00:41.122 --> 00:42.361
but when I do travel,

00:42.362 --> 00:44.461
I pop some of these in there,

00:44.560 --> 00:46.420
and it's so easy to take.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.600
I just take two capsules in the morning before my breakfast,

00:50.601 --> 00:52.681
and that's about all I do.

00:52.682 --> 00:57.781
This DSO one symbiotic has impacted my gut health so much,

00:57.920 --> 00:59.880
so if you're looking for something,

00:59.881 --> 01:01.721
it's definitely worth looking into.

01:01.722 --> 01:04.212
I could not go a single day without using this.
