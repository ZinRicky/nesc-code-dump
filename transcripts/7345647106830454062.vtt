00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.360
Stop getting offended

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.400
that I'm talking about the importance of women

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.540
staying home with their babies when they're born.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.000
You don't think I know that

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.100
a lot of women cannot stay home?

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.200
I went back to work right after my first born.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.000
I worked in the financial industry for 13 years.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.640
I know what the markets look like right now.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.000
I know inflation is an all time high.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.880
My biggest thing is

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.700
we are an uninformed society.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.400
The truth is,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.760
if most women actually knew the psychological effect

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.800
that going to work at such an early age,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.520
after the baby is born, has,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.080
I'm talking lifelong impact,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.280
they would absolutely clip coupons,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.080
they would absolutely rely on a man,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.340
and they would absolutely try to find a job from home.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.840
So, yeah, I might hurt some feelings,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.140
but at the end of the day,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.940
if I can help one woman not regret something

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.320
and inadvertently,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.540
positively affect a child,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.140
I'm gonna keep talking, y'all.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.320
Also, in my career,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.960
I've already helped hundreds of women,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.600
and my community for digital marketing is only growing.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.040
The impact that this is had

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.080
not only on my life,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.480
but on other women around me

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.180
is just insane.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.100
So maybe you wanna boss babe it up.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.400
Maybe you don't have kids.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.120
Maybe you just wanna learn how to work from home

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.600
cause you hate corporate life.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.080
All of those are very valid.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.720
And maybe you wanna stay home with your babies.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.760
That is valid.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.460
That Is why I do what I do.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.360
At the end of the day,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.280
the money is second.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.980
My internal incentive is really to help. Love y'all.
