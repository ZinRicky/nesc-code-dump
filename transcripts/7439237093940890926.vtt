00:00.560 --> 00:04.040
One of my favorite parts about our trip to Ireland

00:04.041 --> 00:08.021
was our time that we spent at Bali Malu Cookery School.

00:08.200 --> 00:12.540
So this school is settled on a hundred acre farm

00:12.680 --> 00:15.720
where they have chickens, they have pigs,

00:15.721 --> 00:20.481
they have cows and they're growing a lot of their own produce

00:20.482 --> 00:22.001
that they're using in the school.

00:22.002 --> 00:28.121
One of my favorite parts was seeing their acre wide glass house

00:28.122 --> 00:31.521
where they're growing just enormous amount of food in there

00:31.522 --> 00:33.341
which is so cool to see.

00:33.840 --> 00:39.140
And then inside the school are world renowned chefs

00:39.200 --> 00:41.720
teaching students from all over the world

00:41.721 --> 00:43.921
how to make food from scratch.

00:43.922 --> 00:45.901
So, so incredible to see.

00:46.240 --> 00:50.720
These chefs are sourcing only the best ingredients

00:50.721 --> 00:56.281
and just making everything slow and from scratch is so amazing.

00:56.282 --> 00:59.401
Each student makes a three course meal every day.

00:59.402 --> 01:00.681
They have a 12 week course

01:00.682 --> 01:03.021
and every day they make a three course meal

01:03.040 --> 01:05.400
and then at lunch they sit down and eat it.

01:05.401 --> 01:07.281
So that was one of the highlights today.

01:07.282 --> 01:11.421
We all sat down and ate an amazing lunch prepared by these chefs.

01:11.880 --> 01:16.240
And then we ended the night at a market and we had,

01:16.241 --> 01:18.801
we think we had the world's best fish and chips.

01:18.802 --> 01:20.901
They were so delicious.

01:21.200 --> 01:27.460
And then we bought a huge chunk of homemade butter from this Irish man

01:27.720 --> 01:29.800
and his Irish Jersey cows.

01:29.801 --> 01:31.981
Was so good. Best day.
