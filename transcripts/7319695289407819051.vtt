00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.560
I got these skin smoothing masks from the TikTok shop.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.000
They're linked right here if you wanna get some.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.620
I do really like them.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.920
They're freeze dried,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.160
so all of the ingredients are preserved

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.500
until they get to you.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.400
And the mask is in a little tray.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.960
You add a little bit of water,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.520
let it sit for about a minute,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.280
that activates all the ingredients

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.020
so that you can then apply the mask.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.000
And I feel like because of that,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.600
they're really easy to kinda stick.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.040
Like you can make it as thick as you want,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.580
it's not super watery

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.240
and it really holds onto your face.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.600
It's not wiggling around.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.235
And they really do smooth your skin and feel amazing.
