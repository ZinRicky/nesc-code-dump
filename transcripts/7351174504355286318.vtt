00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.480
Iâ€™m constantly amazed how many women think feminism is a good thing

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:04.681
women have been so lied to

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:07.561
feminism was created to separate family

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:09.961
we valued our sense of independence so much

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:12.921
that it took away our strong sense of family unit

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:15.821
Kids are being raised by government child care

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.240
women are working just as many hours as the men are

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:21.161
but are still expected to go home and take care of their children

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:24.801
it's a 24/7 job to be a woman living in America

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:26.681
this isn't the American dream

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:29.541
the American dream is living off of one income

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.480
The man provide and we depend on them

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:34.321
The American Dream would be woman taking care of themselves,

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:35.721
the home, their children,

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:36.881
their husband

00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:39.161
Women are meant to be gardening,

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:40.461
cooking good food,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.000
nurturing the ones that they love.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.361
That's when women get a strong sense of self

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:46.201
and when they're in their true feminine energy

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:47.281
that's when they thrive

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:51.401
you cannot convince me that women were meant to work a 9 to 5 job

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:52.661
just like a man is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.760
you see other women being taken care of

00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:55.761
maybe they're cooking

00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:58.721
they're taking care of the children and they're being there present

00:00:58.722 --> 00:00:59.801
and you think wow,

00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:00.761
I would love that

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:03.301
when a woman is in her soft feminine era

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.420
she thrives and that's what any woman wants

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.520
sSociety has brainwashed us to think independence is a good thing

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:12.361
when in reality it just breaks families apart

00:01:12.362 --> 00:01:13.401
now don't get me wrong

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:15.841
I think feminism can be a good thing (supporting women)

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:19.541
but I just feel like it shouldn't have come at the cost of

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.160
losing the family unit

00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:23.481
nobody has a strong sense of family

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:24.841
and why is that?

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:27.841
I would strongly suggest that feminism,

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:31.201
independence women girl bossing a little too hard

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:34.671
took away the strong urgency of having a family
