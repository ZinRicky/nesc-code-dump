00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.520
Guys, I just got out of bed,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.080
so I'm not ready for the day yet.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.300
But I come in,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.940
and we named.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.340
We named the starter Giuseppe,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.420
and Giuseppe has had an explosion.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.600
It's. I'm so shocked.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.600
That was only day two.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.540
Like, it's not supposed to rise that much, right?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.840
Like, I've never had this happen

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.060
like this big bread right now.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.780
What the heck?

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.120
So Giuseppe is for sure alive and.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.640
Oh, okay, Jen,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.720
you're just making a mess now.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.540
But day 3. I haven't even fed him yet.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.640
Look at this.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.780
This is insane.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.920
I'm gonna get ready for the day

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.160
and then take care of this,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.620
move him into a bigger jar. And.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.880
This is bizarre to me.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.860
I was smelling it to see if it smells sour.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.560
He doesn't smell sour yet,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.640
but he has all the bubbles,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.380
and he's obviously risen a lot.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.900
So I'm probably gonna feed him today and tomorrow

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.360
and then make some bread.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.720
But, you know,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.640
the sooner I can make bread,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.020
the better, in my opinion.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.641
Wild morning to start love day. Good grief.
