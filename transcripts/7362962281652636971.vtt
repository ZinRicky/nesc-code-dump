hi everyone I'm at Indiana University in Bloomington Indiana

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:04.641
my alma mater

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:08.921
I previously posted a video about snipers on the roof of the school buildings

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:10.501
here at Indiana

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.280
um no snipers or police so far today

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:16.181
pretty peaceful Sunday on day 4 of the encampment

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.880
um when I saw videos and photos of my friends getting tackled and arrested

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.681
I knew I had to come down for the day

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:24.861
if you can hear the music in the background um

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.780
that would be Chabad House

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.960
uh they've been blasting ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡± music as well as very patriotic American music

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:34.541
as I posted on my story

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.900
um right across the street from the liberation encampment

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.080
I'll be trying to post more updates as they come

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:43.081
but yeah 55+ arrests so far this week

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:46.881
many students facing one year bans from campus as well as faculty

00:00:46.882 --> 00:00:48.401
