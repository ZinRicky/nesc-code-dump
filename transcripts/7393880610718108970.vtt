00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.680
Y'all got a girl talking about

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:04.581
how she doesn't do her husband's laundry

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.160
cause she's his wife, not his mom.

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:08.161
Hi, I'm Lisa.

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:09.001
I'm a stay at home mom

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.421
and I don't usually do my husband's laundry either,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.060
but let's talk about this argument.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.760
But it's funny that we're having this conversation

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.161
cause I did just throw in a load of my husband's laundry,

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:21.321
and it was the exception to the rule of not doing my husband's laundry.

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.561
So when I first got married,

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:23.941
I did my husband's laundry,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.960
but he helped me fold like he did mine sometimes.

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:30.561
It was a mutual thing, kind of like what she was saying in her video.

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:34.441
As my duties grew as a stay at home mom with more kids,

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.581
with older kids, with more responsibilities,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.600
I thankfully

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:41.821
have a husband who sees the labor that I put into the job that I do

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.640
and realize like

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.801
that's something he could be taking over.

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:49.001
He also now throws in towels or household stuff.

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:50.521
He does all the dishes. Like

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:53.761
we have split our domestic labor a huge amount

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.921
since adding kids to our plate.

00:00:55.922 --> 00:01:00.061
And I think that's where this fundamental like conversation comes from.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.840
It's what do you consider stay at home moms duty and what you don't?

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:05.841
And I would argue

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:09.441
anything that a grown adult in your household can take care of

00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:11.641
should be taken off the stay at home moms plate.

00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:14.961
And that actually goes for kids when they Start getting older too.

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:17.881
Believe it or not, my kids also do their own laundry.

00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:20.721
My 9 and 8 year old. Not the two year old, obviously.

00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:22.041
Does that mean I don't like

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:23.961
sometimes help them out throwing a load

00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:25.481
if I notice their things getting full?

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:27.641
Of course not. I make sure that their stuff is done,

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:31.001
but I make sure it's done by making sure they can do it.

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.601
My husband's a grown man. He can do his own laundry.

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:36.281
Doesn't mean I won't help him out if I have an extra minute

00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:37.321
or can do it.

00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:40.601
But that's not under the wheelhouse of a stay at home moms

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:44.041
like expected repertoire of domestic labor.

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:45.441
Or at least it shouldn't be.

00:01:45.442 --> 00:01:48.121
I do my own laundry. He usually does his.

00:01:48.122 --> 00:01:49.621
If you are able and capable,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.300
that shouldn't be a problem.
