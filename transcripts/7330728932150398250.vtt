00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.000
Talk a lot about boundaries within relationships

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
on this app. And so

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.920
people find it very surprising when they realize that

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.160
I've only ever really had to walk away from a

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.000
very small number of relationships,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.920
because I truly believe

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.640
boundaries help you maintain relationships,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.880
not get rid of relationship.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.480
When I have had to walk away from somebody

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.280
or relationship,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.840
it is always been because I have seen

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.240
something in their character

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.520
or in their motivations

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.240
that is no longer compatible with

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.960
the type of relationship I can have.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.760
It's not what they've done,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.800
it's who they are.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920
Maybe there was an action or an incident

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.640
that was a catalyst for this discovery,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.600
but the only time that I've actually had to walk

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.320
fully away from a relationship with somebody

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.000
is because I had realized that my happiness and health

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.600
is not compatible with the form of toxicity

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.960
that they bring to the table.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.880
I wish you well.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.160
I hope you have a great life,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.480
but I'm not gonna be part of it.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.940
I'm gonna be going that way,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.620
and I've never regretted it.
