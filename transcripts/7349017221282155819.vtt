00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.100
So where are we nailing?

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.840
We're, we're.

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.521
We're sort of in long ago.

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.121
We also in the little house.

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.361
We are in the little house.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:09.641
Yeah. Right now.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.001
Is this insane for you?

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.081
It is. It's incredible.

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:13.701
You're doing interviews all day.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.180
It's been crazy busy already,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.040
but this is so real for us to be here

00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:22.421
and for all the hard work finally, like, happen.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.440
I, I don't know that when we started this, uh,

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:28.721
we really got serious about this a couple of years ago,

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:30.801
and any of us could have imagined. Yeah.

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:33.581
Was going to become what you're seeing. Yeah.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.000
And

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.781
what do you think you should say to all the people that can't be here?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.460
Well, I'm sorry you're not all here.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.140
We'd love it if you all could get here,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.760
but there wouldn't be room for all of you here,

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.501
so we are going to share tons of pictures.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.180
We're so grateful for the love that people have the show,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.180
and it's that love that really inspired the creation of all.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.240
So really, thank you.

00:00:58.241 --> 00:00:59.541
Thank you, thank you.
