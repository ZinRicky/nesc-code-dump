00:00.080 --> 00:01.840
We arrived in England yesterday,

00:01.841 --> 00:05.041
and I've been craving Persian food all day long,

00:05.042 --> 00:08.041
so when I found out they had a Persian restaurant on the property,

00:08.042 --> 00:12.221
I obviously had to go. I've been obsessed with ginger ale lately,

00:12.240 --> 00:13.640
and after looking at the menu,

00:13.641 --> 00:16.161
we went with the two different kinds of flat breads

00:16.162 --> 00:19.521
and their signature black garlic hummus and eggplant dip.

00:19.522 --> 00:21.241
They were both so delicious,

00:21.242 --> 00:22.841
and I couldn't stop eating them.

00:22.842 --> 00:24.321
And even though I love the hummus,

00:24.322 --> 00:26.801
there was something so good about the eggplant.

00:26.802 --> 00:30.201
It was perfectly smoky, but also slightly sweet.

00:30.202 --> 00:32.241
For the main course, I got the lamb kebab,

00:32.242 --> 00:33.881
and the boys got chicken.

00:33.882 --> 00:38.021
We also got some rice Frazzi salad and torchy sauce.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.080
This plate was absolute perfection.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.921
The lamb was so juicy, the rice was perfect.

00:42.922 --> 00:44.841
I love a good shirazi salad.

00:44.842 --> 00:46.721
I also tried the boys chicken,

00:46.722 --> 00:47.961
which also was delicious.

00:47.962 --> 00:50.521
And this bread that was sitting under all the meat,

00:50.522 --> 00:51.901
soaking up all the juices.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.760
I'm still thinking about it,

00:53.761 --> 00:56.081
even though I was stuffed and bursting at the seams.

00:56.082 --> 01:00.001
I finished off the salad, but then gave the meat and rice to the boys.

01:00.002 --> 01:03.781
They ordered another round of flat breads for all the leftover dips.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.680
I obviously had to have another bite,

01:05.681 --> 01:08.081
but then I was done and needed something sweet.

01:08.082 --> 01:10.401
So we headed over to the main restaurant,

01:10.402 --> 01:11.921
where I got some hot chocolate,

01:11.922 --> 01:15.381
vanilla and salted caramel ice cream, which was just divine.
