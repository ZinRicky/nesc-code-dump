00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.640
do you remember a while back

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:04.440
there is that woman who sent her husband to the store

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.240
because she wanted to make pumpkin bars

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:07.160
and he was talking about well

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:08.280
there was no pumpkin on the list

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:09.880
so I didn't get any pumpkin because

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:10.920
you know I just

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.000
how dare she not remember to put pumpkin on the list

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.180
I'll show her

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.720
I just have my own real life version of this

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.700
I am making a red wine braised beef stew

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.760
um it's gonna be kind of like a beef bouignon slash

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:22.960
uh pot roast

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:24.320
I don't really know the direction I'm going

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:25.200
but it's gonna be delicious

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.880
and I needed a couple ingredients

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:28.640
and I sent my husband to the grocery store

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:30.220
and I told him to get me a turnip

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.040
and he called me just now because he goes

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:32.960
okay so I looked

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:34.000
they don't have turnips

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.120
they don't have parsnips

00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:36.480
but I did find you a rutabaga

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:38.080
is there any way you might want a rutabaga

00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:38.640
and I said no

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:39.320
I don't want a rutabaga

00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:41.260
it's a completely different flavor profile

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.880
and he was like

00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:42.440
I didn't think so

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.640
but I wanted to call to check

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:44.560
and that my friends

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:47.860
is somebody who actually gives a shit to perform their task

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.840
not to mention

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:50.080
you went to the grocery store in like

00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:52.300
a 30 degree weather with the baby

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.760
simply because he wanted me to have all the ingredients I needed

00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:57.100
so they exist
