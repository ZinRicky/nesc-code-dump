00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.320
So I have an emergency farm stand delivery

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:03.741
I need to get done this evening.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.120
Normally, I would bring my cooler with ice,

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:08.261
but I'm gonna try this electric cooler.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.440
It's like a portable mini refrigerator,

00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:13.201
and you can set the temperature exactly how you want it.

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:15.241
It plugs into the back of my SUV,

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:18.661
and I can control the temperature from the keypad right here.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.640
It will even freeze.

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:22.961
So if you're needing to freeze anything or keep something frozen, um,

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:24.481
over long periods of time while traveling,

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.321
this is perfect. This super lightweight,

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:28.781
super easy for me to maneuver into the car.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.920
It comes with this cooler bag for extra hot days in the car.

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:33.921
This insulates the cooler and helps regulate the temperature.

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:35.601
You can still control the controls.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.681
I'm gonna be using this now instead of my old cooler.

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:39.001
Revised for milk drop offs.

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.801
Having the control of the temperature is really important

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:44.761
when delivering milk, and this makes it a perfect for the job.

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:46.921
I'm also gonna be using it on our upcoming camping trip,

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:49.661
and I'm so excited to be able to take raw milk with us camping.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.940
Just need to rally up these kids and get this milk delivered.
