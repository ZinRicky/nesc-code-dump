00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
I'm fueling up for a day full of organising

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:04.520
I promise the kids that I have their homeschool room organised and put together

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:05.800
by the time they got home from their vacation

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:07.520
and since I have no idea when they're gonna get home tomorrow

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:08.600
I gotta get most of it done today

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.120
I've been staring at this room for two weeks now

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:11.360
hoping it would magically get done

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:12.400
since I don't have a fairy godmother

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:13.280
I guess I have to do it

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:15.960
I ordered a bunch of different bins on Amazon for our manipulatives

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:16.800
really like the ones with lids

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.080
but I'm not quite sure about the colored ones

00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:18.720
but we're gonna give it a go

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:20.240
they're a lot smaller than they looked in the picture

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:22.360
and they don't fit right in the shelf that I had originally planned

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:24.880
but it's fine because so far they're working really great for our art supply

00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:27.560
I spent most of my day going through a box of books and organising our bookshelf

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.280
one side of the room is fun books for the kids to read

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.320
and the other side is history

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.200
science and reference book

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:33.360
I originally wanted a shelf of science and a shelf of history

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.400
the shelves are different heights and don't fit the books the right way

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:37.320
so it end up just being a side of non fiction book

00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:38.680
even though I'm gonna give it my best effort

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:40.920
we know it's not gonna stay that way cause the moment the kids get in the books

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.160
they're gonna be all disheveled anyway

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:43.720
I'm gonna do my best to get over my OCD waste

00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:45.880
cause I really want this room to be a space that they love and enjoy

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:46.880
and come to often the end of the day

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.080
I just really want them to love learning

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.980
and love that we get to do it together as a family
