00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
The Tarte Fake Awake.

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:04.641
It is absolutely worth it.

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:09.061
Look at how much more bright and awake and like.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.040
And it comes in the trio of their best selling items.

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:14.021
This is also their tubing mascara.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.700
I cannot wait to pull it off,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.800
but it really does extend your lashes.

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:23.201
It's so worth it to get the fake way because in the trio,

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:24.681
because you're getting these other two best sellers

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:26.141
that I didn't even know I wanted.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.540
Look, watch,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.820
watch how my eye goes from there.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.420
It so creamy. It goes on really easily

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.860
and like, boom,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.480
it gives you that little, like, dough eyed,

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.261
like Disney princessy look.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.840
It's super worth it.

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:47.941
I love it.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.540
And it even has a little sponge on the bottom that you can blend.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.320
And then it comes with the mascara and the lip vinyl.

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:57.661
Let's try that one too.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.460
I love that you click it up.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.900
Oh, that's pretty.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.900
Oh, that's pretty.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.240
Oh,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.460
okay.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.100
She's ready for the day with those bright eyes.
