00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
Where should I. Should I go?

00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:02.541
Should we do chicken legs?

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.860
Yes, chicken legs.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.240
A Sing Squad listener wrote in and said,

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:11.181
what is the actual definition of exclusive?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.380
Option A is exclusivity means

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.800
exclusivity equals boyfriend and girlfriend. Like.

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:21.901
Or is do you wanna be exclusive?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.520
Option B, do you wanna be exclusive means, yeah,

00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:29.041
I wanna be exclusive. That's a buffer time

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:31.681
where we're deciding if we wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:34.261
I think it's option A.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.840
I think exclusivity equals boyfriend and girlfriend

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:41.961
at my geriatric age and I'm option B.

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:43.281
I think you.

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:45.481
There's like a buffer period where you're figuring out of your.

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:48.421
While you're exclusive and then you become boyfriend girlfriend.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.100
So we. Let us know what you think.
