00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
I am so fucking happy that people are having eyes on Mama Todd,

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.381
because let me tell you about my fucking experience with Mama Todd.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.480
I don't think she's all that she's cracked up to be.

00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:11.901
She does not give a fuck about people.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.580
She is not some loving, caring person.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.520
Some of you may remember me from this video

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:19.161
where I was annoyed

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:23.941
that I felt I was being disrespected as the mother of my children.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.480
The people who knew me and know my story and understand everything

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:29.561
were like, oh, shit,

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:32.521
that's fucked up. People on the internet who didn't know shit about me

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:34.821
just entered in their own details

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.340
and let try to fucking light me on fire.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.160
Mama taught was one of those fucking people.

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:41.421
And here's the thing.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.760
Mental illness was another big creator on this app

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:46.001
that people were tagging him like,

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:47.241
this bitch is a fucking narc.

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:48.841
She's fucking narcissist. Oh,

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:50.981
my god, light her ass on fire.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.760
People must have been doing the same thing to Mama Todd

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.541
because I was being so nasty to the stepmom.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.760
Well, mental illness sent me a fucking DM and said, hey,

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.601
I'm getting tagged a lot in your videos.

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:05.601
What's going on? I literally gave him, like,

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:07.121
three sentences. He was like,

00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:08.821
oh, that's triangulation.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.360
Yeah, but I get it.

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:13.301
People are confused because of the way you're delivering the message,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.320
you know, whatever.

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:15.241
Him and I are now friends.

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.121
Now we're friends. We're mutuals.

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:18.681
On the app Mama taught,

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:22.401
she fucking stitched my video and tried to call me out

00:01:22.402 --> 00:01:24.601
that if somebody's ever giving your child love,

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:26.081
you better accept it.

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:29.301
And you're in the wrong for trying to push this woman away.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.160
She didn't come and clarify any details.

00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:35.561
One simple DM. She didn't give a little once

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:36.841
look over on my content

00:01:36.842 --> 00:01:39.041
to maybe get a little better understanding of the situation,

00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:42.361
because I'm so sorry. Isn't that how grooming of children happens?

00:01:42.362 --> 00:01:43.841
They're really nice to them.

00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:45.841
They shower them with gifts and kindness

00:01:45.842 --> 00:01:47.981
so that they can then later hurt them?

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.880
I have every reason to want to.

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:54.401
And also, if you go back and watch that fucking video,

00:01:54.402 --> 00:01:57.801
I'm not even mad that somebody's helping my child.

00:01:57.802 --> 00:02:00.321
What I'm mad at is that somebody is robbing me of the opportunity

00:02:00.322 --> 00:02:03.201
of being there with them. If this is a mother daughter thing,

00:02:03.202 --> 00:02:04.321
where the fuck is the mom?

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:07.441
You're just the stepmom. Stop trying to step in the way.

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:08.241
Get the. You know what I mean?

00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:09.761
That was my original point, anyway,

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:10.841
wasn't that? Oh,

00:02:10.842 --> 00:02:12.561
I'm so mad somebody's giving my child love.

00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:15.401
I'm mad that you're gonna try to scoop me out of this situation

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:18.261
for no fucking reason, and now I'm fucking pissed.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.540
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.160
So, yeah,

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:22.681
I think Mama Tata is a fraud.

00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:24.201
I think she's lame,

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:26.210
and I'm glad that people are seeing her for who she is.
