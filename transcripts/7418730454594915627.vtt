00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.420
this

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.240
is another perfect example of why I only use the term anti choice

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:12.720
because pro life is simply not an accurate term to describe this policy position

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:17.600
when read as six anti choice justices and Missouri is an anti choice state

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:20.160
you can reconcile the clear contradiction

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:22.880
widely available research demonstrates that abortion bans

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:24.720
actually have disastrous effects

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.440
on the lives of both mothers and their children

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:28.520
so um

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:30.320
after the Roe v Wade decision came out

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:34.960
we saw a whopping 30 to 40% decrease in the maternal mortality rate

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:37.280
of people of color in the postro era

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:41.160
researchers are continuing to gather data on the effects of various states

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:42.040
abortion bans but

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:47.580
researchers are estimating an increase in maternal mortality between 21 and 38%

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.640
not only do abortion bands increase the maternal mortality rate

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:53.720
they also increase the infant mortality rate

00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:55.080
research is still being developed

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:57.840
on the connection between increased infant mortality rates

00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:01.040
and abortion bands but one logical hypothesis is that

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:05.240
when women tell you they do not have the capacity to care for a new child

00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:08.240
that it may be wise to listen to them also lines up with research

00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:09.960
um I'm reading from the turnaway study

00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:13.320
that shows that when a woman is denied a wanted abortion

00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:16.860
that child over the next four years is more likely to live in poverty

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.480
to live in a household that is dependent on public assistance

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:20.760
and to live with adults who don't

00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:22.680
who do not have enough money to pay for food

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.220
housing and transportation

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.040
and those are literally just two examples

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.560
if you wanna know more about the disastrous consequences

00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:30.920
on actual people's lives of abortion bans

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:32.800
I can't recommend the turnaway study enough

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.500
it is a ten year study

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.080
on the consequences of denying individuals a wanted abortion

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:41.240
I'm the feminist lawyer drop any questions you might have in the comments

00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:42.981
and I'll do my best to be helpful
