00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
All Women are innately born with the capability and desire to nurture.

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:06.681
We literally produce life.

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:11.641
So saying you're a feminist and I don't have to take care of my husband is a lie.

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:15.621
Western culture and society has tried instill these views on us

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.920
When in reality being a nurturing mom/wife is truly ingrained into us

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.281
Instincts do not lie,

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:25.801
so you should stop letting society tell you how to run your marriage.

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:27.141
That's not your job,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.440
it's your husband's.

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.621
You are allowed to be successful and have a career,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.280
while still taking care of the ones we love.

00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:37.383
Women who are nurturing are generally happier.
