00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.240
Tracking my menstrual cycle for five years,

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:05.241
monitoring my basal body temperature and cervical mucus.

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:07.401
Instead of my old school basal body thermometer,

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:10.141
I caved and got the ring from thermometer.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.320
Literally half the price of a ring and basically does the same thing,

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.821
but tracks all of my fertility signs and my sleep cycles.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.120
Our menstrual cycle really is our fifth vital sign,

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:21.781
so it's essential for every woman to be tracking it.
