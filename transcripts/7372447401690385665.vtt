00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.069
I'm struggling cause I painted my lounge 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.720
and I didn't like what I did to it

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:05.480
to be honest I think I fkd up

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:06.760
and anyway it's fine

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:08.920
it's just paint we can always repaint it

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:10.020
so at the moment

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.480
I'm tryna repaint it and I've just got halfway through repainting it

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:16.160
I've been testing colours all morning and uh

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:16.880
I'll just show you

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:18.926
because the inside of my lounge looks 

00:00:18.927 --> 00:00:20.380
like the inside of my brain

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.830
there's a lot going on 

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:23.005
none of it good 

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:24.180
And it's a bit of a mess
