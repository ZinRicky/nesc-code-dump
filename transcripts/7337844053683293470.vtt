00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.920
Today, Justice Alito continued to voice his

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.280
discontent with a Virgo Velvee Hodges.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.840
Let me explain, all right?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.080
So if you want the Supreme Court to hear your case,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.960
you have to be like, hey,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.480
Supreme Court,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.320
where you hear my case?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.240
Like, here are the deeds.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.260
And the Supreme Court will usually say no,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.200
and that's called denying certiary.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.400
So this is about a denial of certiary

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.140
out of a case in Missouri.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.840
But instead of just denying it,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.640
just a. Soledo was like, um,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.480
hold on. I just, like,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.540
have a few things that I wanna say real quick.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.800
The plaintiff in the case is Miss Jean Finney,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.600
a lesbian, who sued her employer,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.480
claiming that they discriminated against her

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.960
and retaliated against her for her sexuality.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.080
During jury selection,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.880
Jean Finney's

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.220
lawyer asked the judge to remove three potential jurors,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.400
all express that they believe homosexuality is a sin,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.920
on grounds that they could not be impartial

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.380
in this particular case.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.280
The judge grant,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.840
at the request,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.680
struck the jurors,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.320
and the state of Missouri appealed,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.120
arguing that the jury selection process

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.660
had been discriminatory based on religious grounds.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.760
The Pelo court sided with the lower court judge,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.840
explaining that, no,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.800
these jurors weren't

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.160
eliminated because they're Christians.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.520
They were properly eliminated

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.880
because of their beliefs about homosexuality.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.880
That would impair their ability to be impartial

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.040
in this specific case.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.000
And at this point,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.320
the state of Missouri petitioned for certiary

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.460
of a Supreme Court.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.120
The Supreme Court declines to hear the case

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.040
because of a separate procedural issue,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.080
which Justice Soledo agrees with,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.100
but he writes separately anyways to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.600
express his concerns.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.200
A LEO calls the lower court's decision dangerous

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.920
and claims that

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.640
by questioning the impartiality of jurors

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.520
who literally

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.960
say that they are biased against gay people,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.040
that is akin to the government labeling them as bigots

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.860
and treating them as such.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.440
This is not the first time that Alito has

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.920
expressed that

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.040
he is much more concerned with homophobic individuals.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.520
Ability to discriminate against queer people

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.200
in our public institutions

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.120
through law

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.040
with the backing of the government.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.800
Then he is gay people's right to do

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.740
process inequality under the law.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.800
I'm the feminist lawyer.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.720
I'm gonna pin two other videos that I have

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.560
on the threats to a burgofow.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.657
Ask me any questions that you have in the comments.
