00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.400
and this is what I'm talking about when I'm talking about fat fashion

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:03.561
and the lack of accessibility

00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:04.761
I get invited to a party

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:07.081
a nice party on Monday

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:10.001
it's Friday I have looked at literally every option

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:11.521
I called in the fat cavalry

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:12.801
I checked in with my friends

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:16.941
I look at the clothes that I have literally no option

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.480
currently heading to Staten Island to visit my family

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:22.121
and I'm gonna see now if there's anything that I can use that like

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.481
I forgot that I own

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.181
considering getting something tailored

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.560
trying to find out what I can get shipped

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:27.361
but it's Friday

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:27.961
and like yes

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:31.601
this would be like a kind of situation for anybody trying to find an outfit 

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:34.081
but when I say there are no options

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:35.641
I'm not exaggerating

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:36.561
I'm gonna go visit my family

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:37.441
we're gonna have a car

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:39.521
but there's nowhere to even drive to

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:42.081
to try and find a place where I can shop in person

00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:44.741
because nowhere has my size

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.720
look at the torrid in Staten Island

00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:48.041
maybe plus Brooklyn

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:49.761
which is a vintage store that sells plus sizes

00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:51.641
but those are literally

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:53.361
literally my only options

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:57.161
it's just frustrating how difficult this entire endeavor is because like

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:58.641
I'm so excited to do this with my friend

00:00:58.642 --> 00:00:59.081
like hang out

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:00.441
we have a great time regardless

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:01.961
but it's just so frustrating cause my friends like

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:03.121
oh let's go shopping here

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:03.681
let's look at this

00:01:03.682 --> 00:01:04.121
da da da

00:01:04.122 --> 00:01:04.801
and I'm like yes

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:05.441
like awesome

00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:06.281
but still it's like

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:07.081
I can't do that

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:08.601
I have to figure out my shit on my own

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:09.721
and they're like my

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:10.521
my friends are like oh

00:01:10.522 --> 00:01:11.841
maybe I'll reach out to this person and like

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:13.121
maybe they'll dress me like whatever

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:14.801
and I'm like I can't wait to see the outfit

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:16.441
but at the same time again

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:22.701
it's just so frustrating how difficult it is to find clothing in our size

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.540
literally the most evil position that a fat person can be in

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.800
and it's just like

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:29.961
I just wish we would have a little bit more options

00:01:29.962 --> 00:01:31.361
like a couple more places

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.241
like if there was a handful

00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:35.221
a handful there's two

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.360
and it's not even two within the city

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:39.421
it's two within a two hour trip of me

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.880
like I'm gonna look good regardless

00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:42.143
but god it's fucking annoying
