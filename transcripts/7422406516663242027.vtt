00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
I haven't been to church in like

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:06.341
almost 5 months because I have been so sick this pregnancy.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.480
But tomorrow

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:10.621
I'm gonna try and go to church for the first time in since June.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.040
Beginning of June. So help me pick out what I'm gonna wear,

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:17.921
because I do not know. Three head covering options have beige.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:23.481
This is a sage e green. It's not this muted in person,

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.661
and a light dusty pink.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.160
I want to wear something that kind of shows off the bump

00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:33.341
because no one has seen me since I got pregnant.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.340
I have this dress which I love and I think would show off the bump

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.560
and this dress, which I don't think would show off the bump as much.

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:43.461
Maybe if I put a belt with it.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.080
I have this red dress which looks amazing on me,

00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:49.601
but I also have red hair, so I don't wear it so much.

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:51.841
I have this dress which I really like,

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:53.241
and I think it would show off the bump,

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:54.201
but it's patterned,

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:57.001
so I don't think we'd be able to see the bump as much.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:01.301
I have this dress which I love cause it's florally,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.540
but I really don't know how much the bump would show.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.234
Tell me which dress and which head covering I should wear. Help me out.
