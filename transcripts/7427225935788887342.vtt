00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.720
I think the hardest thing about parenting,

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:03.281
truly the hardest thing about parenting,

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:06.641
is that you look at your own childhood through the lens of a parent

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:09.041
now as opposed to how you've always looked at it,

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.561
which was through the lens of a child.

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:12.501
And children are much more forgiving

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.200
now that you have your own little person that you're in charge of.

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.161
You look back at certain things that happened

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:20.361
or the relationship you had or didn't have with your family,

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:23.881
and you look at it with so much regret and anger

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:25.721
and disbelief and confusion.

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.721
Because you look at the little person that you have,

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:30.201
and you know that you would never do those things to this person,

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:32.401
because the love that you have for them is so strong,

00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:35.441
and the way you prioritize them in your life is different.

00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:37.901
And then you have to ask yourself why you didn't get that.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.540
And that'll take years to unpack.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040
And there's nothing that can make that process easier.

00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:44.241
And there's no way to go back in time

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:46.001
and change anything that ever happened to you.

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:50.161
But I promise you that you will be a better parent by a dealing with

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:52.041
and addressing your childhood,

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:54.081
as opposed to forgiving, forgetting,

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:55.481
and moving on too quickly.

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:58.281
Because trauma has a way of rearing its ugly head

00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:00.081
when you least expect it. And

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:01.321
if you are not going to be repeating

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:02.641
the same mistakes as your parents,

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:04.921
you're gonna have to Figure out what those mistakes were,

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:10.581
what they did to you, and how you're gonna do better. And that sucks.
