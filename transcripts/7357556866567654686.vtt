00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.520
this is why my little raven brain love sterling silver

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:05.121
because I got these hoop earrings

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:08.341
so awesome got them like this vintage from eBay

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.820
I just cleaned it

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.020
hello hello

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.500
do you see that difference

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.600
I this is like

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:22.241
I just love that you can just always make sterling silver look brand new with

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:23.261
here's what I use

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.520
wrights silver cream

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:26.841
this is how much I've used

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:29.201
I like I clean the shit out of my Sterling silver

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:30.841
um and this is also like

00:00:30.842 --> 00:00:32.201
so fun and like

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:34.161
relaxing for me cause I love doing things with my hands

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:37.701
um but this is why I love Sterling silver because like

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.480
you can just like

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:39.841
make old things new again

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:42.481
and I just find so much satisfaction in that

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:43.721
um so yeah

00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:45.001
wait I'll show you how I clean this

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:46.521
okay so I get a little bit honestly

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:46.921
you're supposed to use

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:47.321
like a rag

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:50.221
I use my thumb with my fucked up nail

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.600
um and I like

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:52.541
dig into it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.860
and then I just rub it on here

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.520
and make sure that the whole earring is coated again

00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:02.421
would this be better with like

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.400
a cloth for the entire thing

00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:07.321
yeah this is my little

00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:09.141
I have like actually a little white cloth

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.760
and you just buff it

00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:11.521
just like

00:01:11.522 --> 00:01:13.581
buff the oxidation off

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.980
um

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.300
she's already coming off

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.760
clean clean clean

00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:20.881
buffing and cleaning

00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:22.241
buffing and cleaning Whoo

00:01:22.242 --> 00:01:25.241
doing your finger gives you more control of the places that need the cream

00:01:25.242 --> 00:01:25.954
I guess 

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:26.401
