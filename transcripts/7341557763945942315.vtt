00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.960
Cash strapped consumers should eat cereal for dinner

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.280
to save money. At least

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.380
that's what the CEO of Kellogg said last week on CNBC.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.120
And if consuming chicken for dinner,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.720
family should consume frosted flakes

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.840
or frosted mini hearts

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.720
as the rising prices at the grocery stores

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.000
are being felt nationwide.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.280
And let me be very honest,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.720
the rising prices at the grocery

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.960
are definitely being felt.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.520
My bills have never been so high,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.240
but that doesn't mean I'm going to the cereal aisle

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.720
where there's a bunch of bioengineered,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.360
chemical laid

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.840
and refined sugar doused,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.880
fifasate sprayed wheat,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.000
corn, and soy products.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.320
I'm making my money stretch by loading up my freezer

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.240
with 100% grass fed ground beef,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.840
stewing meat,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.920
bulk grains and flour,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.080
and in seasoned vegetables.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.920
And FYI, a 10.9 ounce box of frosted Flakes is 6 79

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.200
versus 5 10 for the same amount of organic

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.760
100% grass fed ground beef.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.235
Like, are you kidding me, Gary?
