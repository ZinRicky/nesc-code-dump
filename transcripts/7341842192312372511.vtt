00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.780
it's 100% a health care rate

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.700
women are 14 times more likely to die from pregnancy than an abortion

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.980
abortion bans increase the maternal mortality rate up to 21%

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.160
abortion bans increase the infant mortality rate

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:22.881
when we put in abortion bans

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:24.721
we create health care deserts

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:26.361
it has lost two

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:31.401
Idaho has lost two of its most valuable maternity wards

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:33.321
these it's not just a health care right

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:36.041
when you look at the impact on the individual

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:38.681
it is the impact that it has on society

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:43.621
47,000 women die every year attempting to get an abortion

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.920
they have to turn to unsafe abortions

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:49.081
and almost 50,000 women every single year die

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:55.461
forcing pregnancy on individuals has far worse outcomes

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.920
then giving them the care that they have already decided is what they need

00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:04.541
we do not need to be questioning women on their needs

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.040
it has disastrous mental health outcomes

00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:11.121
because you are forcing someone to go through this

00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:12.621
it can k!ll you

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.560
and women will die in the United States

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:18.821
performing non consensual reproductive labor
