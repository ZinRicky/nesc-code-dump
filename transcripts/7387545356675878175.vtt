00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
It is time for a Hank update.

00:02.001 --> 00:04.761
Being so big, I don't even know how old he is right now.

00:04.762 --> 00:07.741
I think he is four and a half months old,

00:07.760 --> 00:09.540
I think. It's hard to keep track.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.600
He's huge. He's still a puppy,

00:11.601 --> 00:13.841
and he's still so sweet and fun.

00:13.842 --> 00:16.541
We found out that he loves the water,

00:16.720 --> 00:19.560
so he plays in the water in the backyard with the kids,

00:19.561 --> 00:21.321
like, almost every day.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.921
He's just like one of the kids.

00:22.922 --> 00:26.921
We think he was allergic to some ingredient that was in his food,

00:26.922 --> 00:28.561
so we had to swap out his food,

00:28.562 --> 00:30.401
and he's doing a lot better now.

00:30.402 --> 00:31.961
He's just, like,

00:31.962 --> 00:33.401
so chill, so nice,

00:33.402 --> 00:35.321
so sweet with the kids. Very hyper,

00:35.322 --> 00:37.481
very playful, which is good for our family,

00:37.482 --> 00:38.881
because that's what we're like.

00:38.882 --> 00:40.921
And we are always on the go.

00:40.922 --> 00:43.441
We're always doing stuff. But he's been so good.

00:43.442 --> 00:45.161
He doesn't really chew up anything.

00:45.162 --> 00:48.501
He's just so much fun. He's a perfect little pup.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.560
I'm gonna set him down, though,

00:49.561 --> 00:52.081
because I don't know how to hold him correctly

00:52.082 --> 00:53.681
at my stage. He's the best.

00:53.682 --> 00:56.841
He loves to fetch, he knows how to sit,

00:56.842 --> 00:59.221
he knows how to shake and lay down,

00:59.480 --> 01:00.560
and he knows his name,

01:00.561 --> 01:02.841
and some of you guys gave suggestions of how to do that,

01:02.842 --> 01:04.081
so we did a lot of different,

01:04.082 --> 01:06.641
like, reward things with him.

01:06.642 --> 01:07.681
Anyway, I gotta go,

01:07.682 --> 01:10.481
but that's the update. He's doing great so far.

01:10.482 --> 01:13.841
The vet Says he'll probably be fully grown by the time he's one.

01:13.842 --> 01:17.461
And he's already huge, so I don't know how big he's gonna get.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.924
Think he's gonna get big. Talk to you later.
