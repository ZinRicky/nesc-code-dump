00:00.080 --> 00:00.920
Here's everything we ate

00:00.920 --> 00:02.520
during our last morning in New York.

00:02.520 --> 00:04.680
We wanted to start off the day by getting bagels,

00:04.680 --> 00:06.800
so we went to Tompkins Square Bagels,

00:06.800 --> 00:07.480
and honestly,

00:07.480 --> 00:09.300
I was so disappointed

00:09.320 --> 00:11.320
they didn't get our orders right,

00:11.320 --> 00:13.320
and my bagel was so toasted

00:13.320 --> 00:15.040
that I genuinely couldn't eat it.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.200
So we went to Joe's Pizza right after

00:17.200 --> 00:19.400
because we needed some food in our system.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.680
Got the cheese slice,

00:20.680 --> 00:21.640
the pepperoni slice,

00:21.640 --> 00:23.860
and then lucky got sausage and onion.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.640
This was actually really good.

00:25.640 --> 00:28.200
We ended up having about five slices each,

00:28.200 --> 00:31.040
and then heading to this Swedish candy shop.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.360
I'm obsessed with any red candies,

00:33.360 --> 00:35.360
so my whole bag was pretty much red

00:35.360 --> 00:36.900
apart from Lucky's candy.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.960
Got him all the watermelon flavored things

00:38.960 --> 00:40.720
because that's his favorite flavor.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.320
Stopped by this candy shop on the way to the bakery,

00:43.320 --> 00:46.480
and then headed over to Supermoon Bakehouse.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.640
Couldn't decide on what to get,

00:47.640 --> 00:48.800
so lucky just insisted

00:48.800 --> 00:50.600
I get all the stuff that I've been eyeing,

00:50.600 --> 00:52.180
so I did exactly that.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.600
We headed back to the hotel,

00:53.600 --> 00:56.120
and lucky made me try this nostalgic candy to him,

00:56.120 --> 00:58.200
which was absolutely vile.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.800
I wanted to be a good sport.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.520
I started off with this Thai tea eclair,

01:02.520 --> 01:03.480
which was so good.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.400
It wasn't too sweet,

01:04.400 --> 01:05.680
it was perfectly creamy.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.040
And then I had this matcha croissant,

01:08.040 --> 01:09.140
which, honestly,

01:09.280 --> 01:10.000
and blow me away,

01:10.000 --> 01:11.360
so it wasn't worth mentioning,

01:11.360 --> 01:12.600
but this passion fruit

01:12.600 --> 01:16.140
custard filled doughnut was absolutely divine.
