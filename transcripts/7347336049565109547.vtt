00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.200
opportunities away from their kids to grow in a game

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.160
I just got home from the gym and I saw that video

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:09.840
and I wanna weigh in as a family that does not prioritize sport

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.240
because I think the original creator

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:12.280
no hate to him whatsoever

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:13.840
this is a really interesting conversation

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:17.880
I think that creator thinks that parents that don't prioritize their kids sports

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:19.020
or travel sports

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.160
are doing so to prioritize themselves

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:22.280
but in reality

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:23.360
at least for my family

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:26.040
I know that it's because we're prioritizing our family time

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:28.620
and I know that we're the aberration in our area

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.920
suburban America

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:32.640
I see more families that prioritize multiple sports

00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:34.200
and taking their kids to and from activities

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.040
than I see family sitting down for family dinner

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:38.920
I also see more parents living vicariously through their children's

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:39.920
athletic aptitude

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:41.520
than I do otherwise

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:42.400
daddy played football

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:43.600
so Timmy's gotta play football

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:44.360
and don't get me wrong

00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.720
you learn lots of great camaraderie teamwork perseverance

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:49.480
determination through sports

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.120
but you can also learn those other ways

00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:53.000
I think what our family is at least trying to do

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.540
is find a balance between fostering our kids talents and interests

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520
and having a close bond as a family

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.360
and I think travel sports can really put a diaper on that

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.160
and don't get me wrong

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:05.680
if I had a kid that was Wayne Gretzky and wanted to be on the ice 24 7

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:07.040
we would be a travel hockey family

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:08.760
I remember reading a quote from Tom Brady

00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:09.320
I think it was

00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:11.300
who said nobody ever had to make him practice

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.120
but the reality is

00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:13.680
I just don't think it's that big of a deal

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:16.880
most kids who play wreck sports aren't gonna go on to the collegiate level

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:18.440
or even the professional level

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:19.360
it's all for fun

00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:23.100
and for fostering those skills that you get from a team sport activity

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.260
but there's a balance

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.280
and I know in our area there is not as much balance as I think there should be

00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:32.020
kids sports have become way too competitive and way too intense

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.960
let the kids have fun

00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:34.040
sure absolutely

00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:35.480
pick a sport try all the sports

00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:36.160
we've tried like

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:37.720
I think a thousand sports at this point

00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:41.000
but don't forget that free time and time with just their family to hang out

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:41.760
go on vacation

00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:43.600
go camping have dinner at home

00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:45.598
those are also good things for kids too
