00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.300
on a cliffhanger about my ex who owes me about $60,000

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.060
financial abuse is so very real and so insidious

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.360
because women are always the ones who are accused of being gold diggers

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.461
but that is the story that men have made up

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.600
and ever since women entered the workforce

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:24.901
they are trying to pay us as little as they can

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.120
and take as much of our money as they can

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:31.221
just about every single abusive relationship I've been in

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.880
unfortunately

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:32.761
there've been a couple

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:34.141
we all know how that goes

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.280
until until you heal yourself

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:40.601
you're gonna continue finding different versions of yourself

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:43.061
pointing out the areas that you need to heal

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.060
enough about that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.480
uh in every single one of them there has been financial abuse

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:51.681
you know it somehow it's my fault that they're in this situation

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:56.521
and because they're spending so much of their time and energy on me

00:00:56.522 --> 00:01:01.361
I owe them my money because they can't work or they can't earn as much

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:03.961
if they wouldn't have been giving so much to me

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:05.881
or some version of some bullshit story

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:07.161
they need to borrow some money

00:01:07.162 --> 00:01:08.201
they need to stay with you

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:15.281
like they are just using and abusing women and leaving us in the dust

00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:17.401
and it is not a measure of intelligence

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:21.861
it is a measure of their manipulation and willingness to be cruel
