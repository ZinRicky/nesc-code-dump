00:00.000 --> 00:01.780
Trying some ice cream today.

00:03.040 --> 00:04.680
I love a good homemade ice cream,

00:04.681 --> 00:06.721
but we got sent some ice cream,

00:06.722 --> 00:11.321
so might as well try it. These are all the flavours we're working with.

00:11.322 --> 00:13.141
What do we get started with?

00:13.480 --> 00:15.960
Trozen fudge. It's vegan.

00:15.961 --> 00:17.701
Trozen fudge. Let's do it.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.260
Oh, okay.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.740
Smells like cinnamon.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.500
Do you smell like ice? Does it? How does ice smell?

00:31.320 --> 00:32.140
Cheers.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.460
Wait, no, you gotta make a noise.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.240
Not my cup of tea. I like this one.

00:44.241 --> 00:45.081
You do? I like it.

00:45.082 --> 00:45.941
Rate it.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.600
I don't know yet. Chocolate is too strong to me.

00:49.601 --> 00:51.081
I don't really like chocolate,

00:51.082 --> 00:52.681
so that wasn't the vibe for me.

00:52.682 --> 00:55.301
What I'm most excited about is the Earl Grey one.

00:55.360 --> 01:00.580
I rate that ice cream a four out of 10.

01:01.000 --> 01:01.940
Earl Grey.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.620
Try this. Gorgeous.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.460
What's this one? Earl Grey.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.380
What's Earl Grey? A tea.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.460
Mmm.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.420
That is so floral. Fragrant.

01:16.040 --> 01:16.680
Holy crap.

01:16.681 --> 01:20.381
Even feel like the ice cream flavor you would like giving dirt.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.400
I'm kidding. No,

01:23.401 --> 01:24.321
I like it. It's okay.

01:24.322 --> 01:25.641
I like it. Would you rate it?

01:25.642 --> 01:26.701
I like it.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.900
Okay. I rate the troll and fudge.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.440
It's at a solid eight right now.

01:32.441 --> 01:36.101
This is a 5. A 5?

01:36.480 --> 01:39.080
I rate this an 8. It's so good.

01:39.081 --> 01:42.521
Then we have cranberry and cheesecake.

01:42.522 --> 01:44.401
I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

01:44.402 --> 01:46.261
This is what we're working with.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.440
Good swirl in there. Chunks of cheesecake.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.081
I've actually never had a cheesecake.

01:50.082 --> 01:51.161
I think. Don't know if.

01:51.162 --> 01:52.341
I'm not that I remember. What is this

01:54.520 --> 01:57.140
one? Out of 10?

01:57.680 --> 01:59.880
Cookies and cream caramel swirl.

01:59.881 --> 02:01.201
Now, this one,

02:01.202 --> 02:04.581
I'm so freaking excited to try.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.600
Wow. I'm so excited.

02:07.601 --> 02:09.081
You washing my spoon for me?

02:09.082 --> 02:10.161
Yeah. Thanks, honey.

02:10.162 --> 02:12.381
Here you go. I appreciate that.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.100
Hmm.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.300
Hmm.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.240
Stunning

02:25.360 --> 02:27.840
strawberry shortcake. Oh, okay.

02:27.841 --> 02:30.181
It looks pretty. I might change my opinion.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.840
This hot stuff. Oh.

02:34.841 --> 02:36.541
I don't know if I'm gonna like this one.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.600
Yeah, I saw it,

02:37.601 --> 02:38.701
and I thought that.

02:39.280 --> 02:42.260
Mmm. I stand corrected.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.360
Wow. It's actually.

02:45.361 --> 02:48.661
That's stunning. It's actually really good.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.180
An 8.5,

02:50.800 --> 02:55.260
7.26. About the up to nine.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.700
I think I'm gonna like this one.

02:58.320 --> 03:03.780
Brown sugar chunk with cookie dough and brownies. This is our last one.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.540
This is what we're working with.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.840
Scooping ice cream is so hard for me.

03:13.841 --> 03:18.221
Sometimes it's a 9. It's a 9.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.440
And that, to me,

03:19.441 --> 03:20.461
is a 7.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.560
I love how rich and luscious the ice cream is.

03:23.561 --> 03:25.441
Of all of these, they're so creamy,

03:25.442 --> 03:29.501
so good. My top favorite one was the strawberry shortcake.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.320
I don't know what it was about it.

03:31.321 --> 03:32.741
Look how stunning it looks.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.740
What was yours? The churro and fudge. Yes.
