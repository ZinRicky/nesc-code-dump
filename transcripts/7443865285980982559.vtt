00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.560
Someone just sent me a DM,

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:04.361
and she said that her ex is starting to call her

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:06.281
with the new girlfriend in the background,

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:07.221
and they're, like,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.440
talking shit and, like,

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.521
antagonizing her and, like,

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:10.601
giving her a fucking hard time.

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:12.761
She's like, it's wild because I watch your video,

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.201
so I understood what they were gonna do.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:16.141
And it's like, kind of funny watching it.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.280
And here's the thing. Here's like,

00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:20.501
the next best part about that.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.360
Branny Brown,

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:25.881
who is a researcher in emotions at the university of Texas,

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:27.081
like, her whole fucking life

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:29.361
is dedicated to researching feelings and emotions

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.261
and everything about feelings.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.940
She has said that

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.660
two people coming together for the hatred of one thing

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.520
will be united for a little bit.

00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:45.841
You can totally find a unity in two people hating the same thing.

00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:48.481
But you will not find longevity with that.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.121
Like, that's not the kind of.

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:53.681
You can't base a long term commitment on that.

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:57.481
That's not. That's not the proper foundation for long term,

00:00:57.482 --> 00:00:59.741
healthy longevity, like,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.340
healthy, fueled relationships.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.800
So when that happens, number one,

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:05.001
you're like, okay, cool.

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.941
Got it. You guys are definitely off to the same toxic start,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.700
whether you. You know what I mean?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.040
And you can, like,

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.021
secretly laugh inside cause you're like,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960
y'all are bonding over your hate

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:19.961
over me not understanding that once you realize I'm not gonna react,

00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:21.781
I'm not gonna participate. Like,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.220
okay, have your happiness and hate for me.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.840
And you keep living your happy life,

00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:29.481
their relationship just crumbles

00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:32.581
because it's all based on just trying to hate you.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.760
So you just, like, truly,

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.841
truly, truly

00:01:35.842 --> 00:01:38.961
the best revenge, the best win, win,

00:01:38.962 --> 00:01:39.521
win, win,

00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:43.261
win situation for everything. Everybody. Everything. Children,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.640
pets, parents.

00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:49.161
Great. Everybody to move forward in your own life happy and healthy

00:01:49.162 --> 00:01:51.601
and not give a fuck what people are saying about you.

00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:54.341
Because the truth always comes out, like,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.760
and. But.

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:57.521
And ugly people are gonna be drawn to ugly people.

00:01:57.522 --> 00:01:58.941
Like, you can't help that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.740
Ugly people still have friends.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.480
Do you know what I mean? There are shitty people that are like,

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:04.601
I know that person shitty,

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:06.521
and that's why I wanna be their friend.

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:08.241
And it's the perfect, like,

00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:11.481
strainer for your life. You just rise above

00:02:11.482 --> 00:02:13.401
and all the everybody else, like,

00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:14.921
sticks together. You find your people.

00:02:14.922 --> 00:02:17.381
It's great. It's. It's great.
