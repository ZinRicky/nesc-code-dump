00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.200
My husband called me from the office craving a pumpkin pie,

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.521
so I got to work that afternoon.

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:05.761
We're starting with a homemade crust,

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:08.641
of course, using glyphosate free flour and pasteurized butter.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:09.761
After trimming the excess,

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:12.361
I crimp the edges for a decorative look using my thumb.

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:13.321
I throw this in the freezer

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:15.641
and then get to making some homemade pumpkin puree

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:18.241
by baking sugar pie pumpkins for 40 minutes until soft.

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:20.321
I then puree the flash until it's soft,

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:21.321
smooth and creamy. Then

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:24.321
I pop the frozen crust into the oven for a 15 minute pre bake

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:26.361
at 425 degrees every night.

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:29.361
Filling comes together in no time in one medium sized bowl in pie

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.081
spice, salt,

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:31.801
coconut sugar, pumpkin puree,

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:33.901
rock cream, pasture raised eggs and vanilla

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.720
and stirred the filling

00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:36.761
and then we poured it into the pre baked pie shell.

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:39.761
This baked for 35 minutes until set but still slightly jiggly

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:42.441
and cooled overnight. We cut into it one evening later.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:45.581
It was perfectly pumpkin scrumptious with healthy ingredients.
