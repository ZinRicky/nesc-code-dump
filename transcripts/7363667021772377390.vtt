00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
Men do not want a woman that “needs” them

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.560
Men want a woman that *wants* them

00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:07.201
there's a huge difference there

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:08.886
the woman who needs a man

00:00:08.887 --> 00:00:11.921
expects him to provide and pay for everything

00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:14.321
because she can't provide for herself

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:16.721
These are the same woman who have no job

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:18.101
no source of income

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.358
and they try to flip the script on men 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.241
and try to make them feel inadequate

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:23.922
saying they need a man who can 

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.201
provide for both of them, off of one income

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:28.601
when it's just unrealistic for one

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:29.901
In this economy?!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.581
excuse me?

00:00:30.582 --> 00:00:31.281
they're like

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:32.462
“I don't need a job, 

00:00:32.463 --> 00:00:35.501
I need a man who makes enough money for the both of us”

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.300
Are you hearing yourself right now?

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.880
When a woman has her own money,

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:40.161
has her own job

00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:44.921
then the man knows that she's not using him because she has nothing

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:45.961
when you're broke

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.613
you need a man to live, to survive 

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.281
She may not even love you

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:53.501
she might just like what you can provide or what you do for her

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.520
Stop trying to finesse men for their money

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.461
A real woman doesn't need a man

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.800
She doesn't need you

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:01.177
She wants you
