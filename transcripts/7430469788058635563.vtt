00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.120
I'm so excited that it's finally fall

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:05.120
and I have started to incorporate fall transitional wardrobes

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:06.760
and we're switching the makeup up

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:09.680
so I just got 4 new Revlon lipsticks

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:11.920
they're all super Moody for fall

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:12.960
and I wanna try them on with you

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:15.380
because Revlon is my favourite drugstore lipstick

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.040
and they can do no wrong so I have four shades right here

00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:20.380
let's try em first one is Rum Raisin

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.540
very Rachel Green

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.540
the next is vampire love

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.640
this one's in the same shade family

00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:37.700
but definitely darker and definitely a little bit more blue toned

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.620
this is Raisin Rage

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.900
could I have little bit of the makeup

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.540
you want some lipstick

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.280
so this one is more like a brick red

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:58.380
which I really like but definitely not like as Berry toned as I would like

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.560
little more orange to it okay

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:02.320
actually this is growing on me

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.160
I think I do really like this now

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:05.800
this is definitely the darkest one

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:08.580
this is black cherry and I've worn this for years

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.840
now this one is a truly vampy

00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:15.560
perfect for Halloween and fall season

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:18.040
burgundy Berry lip what do you think

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:20.500
do you like my lipstick um

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.740
it's too darkish

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.100
I guess he's not a fan
