00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
One of the most common questions I get asked as a tribe wife

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:05.321
is if I vote. And the answer is yes,

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:08.941
I do. I consider it my responsibility as an American citizen,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.480
and this election especially

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:12.781
is one of the most important of my lifetime.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.760
If you've been following my pregnancy,

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.881
you'll know that I was basically on bed rest for four months,

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:20.581
too sick to go anywhere.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.240
I wasn't sure if I would make it to my own baby shower,

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:27.081
much less to go vote. But then I found out I can vote early in person,

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:29.861
which means I'm not limited to just election Day.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.660
Pregnancy has caused me to have to be super flexible.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.320
And that is just what early voting is.

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:37.601
I can cast my ballot on my schedule

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:41.721
and not have to worry about being too sick day of. No,

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:43.201
election day is the deadline,

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:46.681
not the start. So I'm gonna vote early and in person

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:49.921
and give myself the best chance to make sure my vote is counted

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:53.001
and avoid last minute issues by casting my ballot ahead of time

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:54.761
in person. And

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:55.201
I feel good

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:57.741
that this release a little bit of pressure on the poll workers, too.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.320
So if you're like me,

00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:02.321
not sure how easy it will be for you to go vote on Election Day,

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:03.881
maybe this is a good option for you too.

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:05.741
And for the naysayers, no,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.607
my husband doesn't tell me who to vote for.
