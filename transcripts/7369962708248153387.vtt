00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
You're the executive director for the American America First Legal,

00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.721
correct? That's correct.

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:11.161
Alright. And America First Legal is a member of Project 2025,

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:12.681
which is dedicated to creating

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:15.701
the playbook for the next conservative administration

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.900
and what it calls the project pillars. Correct.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.820
We are proud contributors to Project 2025.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.920
Okay. And, uh,

00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:30.741
are you familiar with Project 2020 Five's mandate for leadership?

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.260
In fact, I am.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.760
Okay. And in fact,

00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:38.761
you wrote some of the sections of this mandate related to the DOJ,

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:40.381
correct? Sure did.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.680
And the mandate outlines policy priorities

00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:45.241
for the next conservative president,

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:46.001
is that correct?

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:47.681
It does. You've done a great job.

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:48.821
I just wanna let you know.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.360
Alright, so let's walk through some of the provisions of the mandate.

00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:55.521
It calls for eliminating the department of education,

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.341
eliminating the department of Commerce,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.520
deploying the military

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.881
for the use of domestic law enforcement against protesters

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:05.021
under the Insurrection Act of 18 O seven.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.520
It also has

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:11.941
the repealing of Schedule F status for thousands of federal employees

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.620
to allow a president to replace career civil servants

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.200
with unqualified,

00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:18.681
partisan loyalist.

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:20.741
That's probably my favourite of it.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.060
It also prohibits

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.420
the FBI from combating the spread of misinformation and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.420
disinformation,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.800
like Russia and China,

00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:33.701
who are actively trying to interfere with American elections.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.660
I don't know why or how anybody can support Project 2025.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.960
And I know that there was allegedly a joke about, um,

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:50.601
dictators and whether or not that's funny,

00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:53.961
but in In the United States of America,

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:56.021
dictatorships are never funny,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.220
and Project 2025 is giving the playbook for authoritarianism

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.311
as well as the next dictator to come in.
