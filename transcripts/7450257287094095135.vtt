00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.800
Let's talk about Lily Phillips,

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.181
because I don't know what the big fucking problem is.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.620
If you watch the documentary and listen to what she is saying.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.080
Not what he says, what she says.

00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:14.901
She's like, I'm super excited to do this. I can't fucking wait.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.740
Come to find out the hundred in a day was practice for the thousand.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.440
Thousand has always been in the plans.

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:25.081
This is like, you know,

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:26.621
a fighter, you know,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.080
this is like working up the ranks.

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:30.881
She's excited to do this.

00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:35.301
Every single one of those guys got a hock to a moment of his own

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.220
by her own. Like she wanted to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.320
the. The only negatives you hear are she'll say,

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:45.501
I'm so excited, and then he will,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.560
in his documentary style, say,

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.921
oh, I could sense the nervousness.

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.241
All the nerves and fear

00:00:52.242 --> 00:00:54.861
and anxiety that you're hearing are coming from him.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.780
She asks him in the beginning of the documentary,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.760
are you kinky? Do you do sexy things?

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:01.361
Or, you know,

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:03.021
are you into anything? Like,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.800
he's like, oh, god, no,

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:05.161
no, no,

00:01:05.162 --> 00:01:05.601
no, no, no.

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:07.361
He's like, as vanilla as they come.

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:08.621
Seems like it, too.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.660
So the documentary was done through his eyes,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.120
so of course

00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:17.561
it seems like she's so fucking anxious and nervous and scared.

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:18.721
That's what he. No,

00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:20.481
every. Anytime she said she was excited,

00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:21.041
he's like, oh,

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:23.521
I could sense her fear. He even says, oh,

00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:25.681
I bet she didn't think about condoms and She's like,

00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:26.121
yeah, no,

00:01:26.122 --> 00:01:28.241
we thought about condoms. Did you think about testing?

00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:29.081
She's like, yeah, no,

00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:32.181
we've asked them to get tested and send us a screenshot of their tests.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.660
Like, he's the one that's making it seem worse than it is.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.420
She's fully fine. She's great.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.060
At the end of the day, when she does start to cry,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.960
she's mad at the dudes that are being disrespectful to her.

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.161
She made it very clear, don't finish in my eyes.

00:01:49.162 --> 00:01:50.681
She said that she would tell them multiple,

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:51.401
multiple, multiple times,

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.941
what do they do? They go right ahead and go right for the eyes.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.400
She asked dudes to like, okay,

00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:56.401
we gotta be done. And they would, like,

00:01:56.402 --> 00:01:57.241
guilt trip her and be like,

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.701
oh, you're not gonna make me finish.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.780
So the part that she had a problem with was the men's disrespect.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.740
It wasn't.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.520
It wasn't the event. She liked it.

00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:11.161
She enjoyed it. And then in the TMZ interview she did after,

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:12.901
where she talks about when she cries,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.840
she's like, no,

00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:15.401
I'm crying because I just had this,

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:16.961
and I did have an intense day,

00:02:16.962 --> 00:02:18.921
but then now I got a camera crew in my face,

00:02:18.922 --> 00:02:20.201
and they're all in my shit.

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:22.341
Like, I think she's very gently trying to be like,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.900
he's kind of a dick. I don't think he.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.500
He put his personal spin on that to make it seem worse.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.340
She likes it.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.780
There are people who like it.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.700
You don't. Have to want that much sex.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.660
But there are people who do.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.280
She is a creator. She's the one.

00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:45.001
She produces it. It's.

00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:47.681
It's the website where she gets to have full control.

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:49.241
Nobody's making her do this.

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:50.981
I don't know why people are, like,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.580
so fucking up in arms over this.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.200
She is okay with it. You can be okay with it.

00:02:58.201 --> 00:02:59.781
You don't have to participate,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.420
you don't have to watch it.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.700
And you also don't need to put a negative spin on it when it's.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.620
She is.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.740
She's got a great relationship with her family.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.540
What is the fucking problem?

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.480
There's no fucking problem.

00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.854
No fucking problem whatsoever.
