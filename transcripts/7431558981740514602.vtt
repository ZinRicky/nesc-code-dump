00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.720
So my husband and I are taking our big kids out to dinner tonight

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:05.481
and then onto a haunted carriage ride here in Charleston.

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:07.121
It's one of these things we've always wanted to do,

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.281
but we just have never done.

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:10.121
And since it's the week of Halloween,

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:13.601
it is the perfect time to go do a haunted Charleston carriage ride.

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:14.881
So I'm putting my outfit together.

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.581
This is where we are so far.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.160
I kind of love how the stripe of the shoe

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.201
matches the black and white stripe of the top.

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:24.441
It's giving very, like,

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:25.661
Addams Family.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.060
I love. So for accessories,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.800
I'm kind of between a couple pieces.

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:34.441
For the headband, I have this sparkly black one.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:35.521
This one that's, like,

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:37.441
a cheap one off of Amazon with, like,

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:39.001
a little couple pearls on it.

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.481
And then this, my orange one from Brianna Cannon,

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:46.281
which I think would be fun to add in the halloweeny colors,

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:48.141
add that little pop of orange.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.960
My kids are also wearing orange,

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:51.961
so I think I might go with this one.

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:53.141
But let's see.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.340
The black and white could be cute, too.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.340
I kind of like the orange.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.060
Try this one.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.160
That's very, like,

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:08.421
subtle and demure, which I don't think is what we're going for,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.680
especially because these are the earrings.

00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:12.661
They're little spider webs.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.080
Okay. I went with the orange because I think it's just.

00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.321
It's Halloween. We're leaning into it.

00:01:18.322 --> 00:01:20.961
And this is the outfit. Added a little belt.

00:01:20.962 --> 00:01:23.081
Right here. And I'm so excited.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.061
I can't wait to go. I think we're gonna have so much fun.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.540
I love Halloween.
