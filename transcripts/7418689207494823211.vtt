00:00.400 --> 00:01.720
Okay, for the viewers watching,

00:01.721 --> 00:03.681
this is my fifth voice over,

00:03.682 --> 00:05.481
just so you all know. Anyways,

00:05.482 --> 00:07.681
we're gonna put some good skin prep on, okay?

00:07.682 --> 00:10.561
We're gonna get all the skin prepped and ready to go

00:10.562 --> 00:13.961
for a nice makeup look. We're gonna conceal these bags.

00:13.962 --> 00:15.861
It's crucial to conceal them.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.240
Now we're blending this off,

00:18.241 --> 00:21.241
blending it in together. We're gonna flick up the eyebrows,

00:21.242 --> 00:24.221
make them look so slick, like a cow licked it.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.520
Now we're gonna highlight on the cheekbones,

00:26.521 --> 00:29.241
on the nose. Blend, blend,

00:29.242 --> 00:30.401
blend, blend, blend, mix,

00:30.402 --> 00:31.521
mix, mix.

00:31.522 --> 00:34.461
Now for the hero, it's the blush.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.060
Now listen, people don't do a lot of blush,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.120
cause then you just look like a clown. Okay?

00:40.121 --> 00:43.461
Just a nice little layer, a nice little kiss.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.000
Now we're gonna blend more.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.121
I think it was highlighting.

00:46.122 --> 00:47.421
Yeah, we're blending more.

00:47.800 --> 00:48.680
Putting stuff on her eyes,

00:48.681 --> 00:51.501
setting that stuff with a good setting spray,

00:51.520 --> 00:54.920
adding some eyelashes in. This is looking good.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.361
Now touch, touch, touch,

00:56.362 --> 00:57.361
light, light, light, finish,

00:57.362 --> 00:58.621
finish, finish.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.240
Now the lips, okay?

01:00.241 --> 01:01.161
The lips, the lips,

01:01.162 --> 01:02.641
the lips. It's all about the lips.

01:02.642 --> 01:05.064
We got a little combo here to give us this look.
