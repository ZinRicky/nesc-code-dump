00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.400
There isn't a single male CEO in America

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:05.841
who is not benefited from family planning

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:07.641
and from abortion rights.

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:08.801
Right. Either personally,

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:12.361
because he's able to control how many kids he's going to have

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:14.201
and when he has them with his partner.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:15.741
But also collectively.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.560
Gender violence,

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:20.521
which is force birth and no reproductive freedom,

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:22.081
is a direct, um,

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:26.081
predictor of an unstable society and a society that is not peaceful,

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:28.181
that. That has high levels of conflict.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.280
And so where we're heading right now is.

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:31.741
Is very dangerous,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.360
not just for individual people,

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.401
but for ourselves as a society.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.881
And so I implore every man,

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:39.961
whether he is the CEO of a company

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:43.361
or a member of Congress or a member of our government,

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:45.081
tell us your abortion story,

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:46.541
because we know you have them.
