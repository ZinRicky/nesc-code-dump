00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.640
this is not my normal content

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:04.800
but with the end of Vanderpump Rules original cast coming to an end

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.120
I wanna talk about Lala Kent for a second

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:10.960
because I think she had one of the most interesting and relatable story arcs

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:13.000
on this entire show and I think

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.360
although it didn't start out this way

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:16.100
and obviously it wasn't her intention

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.660
it really serves as a cautionary tale to younger women about pick me behaviour

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.760
and I don't say that to judge

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:26.080
because I see a lot of similar behaviours in myself in my early 20s

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:28.120
because Lala Kent was not the only woman

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.980
who was taught the how to keep a man mentality

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.160
you know if you look good and you're agreeable

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:34.740
your husband won't leave you right

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.040
as long as you're sexually adventurous and open

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:40.800
and not like that nagging ex of his who never appreciated things he did

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.440
he will treat you well and at one point or another

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:45.200
we all believe that that is true

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:49.440
Lala moved heaven and earth to be fun and cute and young and agreeable

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:53.000
and sexually adventurous and super spontaneous

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.080
and to help him take care of his step kids and his home

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:59.240
and guess what a scumbag was always gonna be a scumbag

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.380
and that's because

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.860
and that's because a good and loyal man is not a reward for good behaviour

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.100
it has to do with integrity and how they value their partner

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.880
you know I know the old saying is that you can't turn a hoe into a housewife

00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:12.600
but you can definitely turn a hoe into a housewife

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:15.100
more often than you can turn a scumbag into a saint

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.280
so the cautionary tale in Lala's story

00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.480
is not that you can't turn a hoe into a housewife

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:22.260
because she did and she was successful at it

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.080
is that if a man treats women and his female partners like a commodity

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:28.600
and has proven that in his ex relationship

00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.960
or blames the ending or cheating on his last relationship

00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:35.340
on something that the woman did performance wise

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.140
it's that you will never be good enough to change a man from his true nature

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.700
cause there's nothing in your power that you can do to keep a man

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.500
who's always looking over the fence to see what's next

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.420
and I just wish Lala the best in this new chapter of life
