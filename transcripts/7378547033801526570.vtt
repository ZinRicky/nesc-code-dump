00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.840
Interests and hobbies are very important

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:05.600
Equally as important as your partner in your relationship

00:00:05.601 --> 00:00:08.120
having hobbies so you can come together

00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:09.120
share your interest

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:10.600
or even share the same hobbies

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:12.240
it's great for any relationship

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.289
but what's most important in any relationship 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.074
is having the same taste 

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:18.360
in interior design

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:19.720
probably the most important

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:23.520
because I don't know what I would do if my husband came to me and said oh

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.160
I really like neon colors in the house

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.492
or I like the 70s quirky retro aesthetic 

00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:30.423
because no..

00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:31.480
 I'm beige modern 

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:34.360
Our relationship would not work if that was his style

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:35.280
don't get me wrong

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.120
we're not always gonna have the same taste

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:38.540
but interior design

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.920
it's very important

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:42.520
thankfully he likes the same color scheme I do

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:43.600
he likes clean

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:45.520
he likes the clean girl aesthetic

00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:48.268
I think that's one of the most valuable things in a relationship
