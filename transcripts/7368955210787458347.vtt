00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.280
After my divorce hearing, where I was married for 10 years,

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:04.401
I was a traditional wife.

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:06.601
I was a stay at home mother to four children.

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:08.181
One of them is disabled.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.040
She had four open heart surgeries.

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:12.161
I have been their primary parent

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:16.701
since the moment they entered this universal realm.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.920
I'm the person that they have known from sun up to sun down

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:21.181
and through the night.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.880
They do have two parents,

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:24.681
but the way our family was structured,

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:26.341
I was the one that took care of them.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.260
He was a little bit busy doing other things.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.660
I wrongfully assumed that courts would

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.380
see the situation for what it was

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.320
and give me everything that I wanted

00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:41.441
and I would be able to remain their primary parent

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:43.241
and remain in goods.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.401
Like just everything would be amazing.

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:45.441
And that's not what happened.

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:48.941
I had to not only split custody, but in my.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.000
In my opinion,

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.961
it was horrible because this person doesn't even have their own home.

00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:54.921
He is living with his romantic partner.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:58.001
So I was like, how is the court gonna give you 50% custody?

00:00:58.002 --> 00:00:59.241
You don't even have a fucking home.

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:01.421
You're an actual hobo. Sexual.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.560
You have no home,

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.641
no job, nothing.

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:05.721
There's no way a court is gonna give you 50% custody.

00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:06.441
They sure as fuck did.

00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:07.361
Not only did they,

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:10.241
they awarded him child support

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:12.801
because he quit his job right before the divorce hearing

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:14.161
to throw off our income.

00:01:14.162 --> 00:01:17.821
And then the Court used a really fucked up calculation for my income,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.320
and it was just, like,

00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:22.041
literally the worst of the worst of the worst.

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:25.201
My attorney said her jaw was on the floor.

00:01:25.202 --> 00:01:29.681
She has never had a divorce end up so lopsided

00:01:29.682 --> 00:01:31.581
in her whole fucking career.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.400
And then she wished me luck, and I was on my way.

00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:35.021
If I didn't have the money to pay her.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.140
Sucks to suck.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.720
In the franticness of like,

00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:39.681
oh, my god,

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:42.121
I have to give this person some.

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:43.201
I'm gonna be homeless.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:43.721
Do you know what I mean?

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:47.281
Like, how am I gonna pay child support and pay my rent and all my bills

00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:49.141
when I'm barely making it by myself?

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.000
Needless to say,

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:50.681
it's been five years.

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:51.561
I never went homeless.

00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:52.681
I never lost anything,

00:01:52.682 --> 00:01:53.681
I never lost my kids,

00:01:53.682 --> 00:01:55.781
and I've only gotten stronger and better.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.240
And it was because in the franticness after that,

00:01:58.241 --> 00:01:59.481
I called an attorney, thinking,

00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:00.401
somebody has to fix this.

00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:01.701
Somebody's gonna make it better.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.640
And I called an attorney.

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:03.561
I told him the whole story,

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:04.441
and he was like,

00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:07.021
do you want me to tell you the real fucking truth?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.080
Talk to you like you're my fucking sister?

00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:10.481
Or do you want me to give you, like,

00:02:10.482 --> 00:02:11.161
the polite answer?

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:14.101
Like, he could hear the vulnerability and the. The.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.060
The desperation in my voice.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.660
He was like, get the fuck over it.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.060
Divorces suck.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.360
People get bad results,

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:24.761
and if you continue to Try to fight with him in the courts,

00:02:24.762 --> 00:02:26.481
you're only gonna make yourself look worse.

00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:27.481
You can be angry,

00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:28.641
you can be mad,

00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:30.361
but you need to just shut the fuck up,

00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:34.401
put your head down, and focus on your life with your kids.

00:02:34.402 --> 00:02:37.001
Because the longer you sit in that anger

00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:38.941
about how it didn't go your way,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.640
your pot, you're stopping yourself.

00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:43.141
You're slowing down your healing, your.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.900
Yeah, you're slowing down your healing.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.760
It was like a light clicked in my head.

00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:52.161
Like, you're right.

00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:54.481
It's over. The divorce is over.

00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:56.401
The decisions have been made.

00:02:56.402 --> 00:03:00.441
I can either accept it and move forward and focus on my life

00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:01.681
and focus on solutions

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:05.441
and focus on. At least I don't have this ugly, fucking dusty in my bed,

00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:08.621
in my body, in my anything anymore.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.560
And that's what I did.

00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:11.441
And life got better.

00:03:11.442 --> 00:03:14.161
The minute you stop looking at all the problems

00:03:14.162 --> 00:03:16.261
and start thinking of solutions,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.140
everything starts to get better.
