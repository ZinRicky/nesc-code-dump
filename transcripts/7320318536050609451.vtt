You guys know how important hydration is for my skin,

00:04.240 --> 00:07.220
so I had to find products that do exactly that.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.480
One of them is this.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.280
MAC Hyperreal Ceramizer.

00:10.280 --> 00:13.320
Uses niacinamide to retextracize your skin

00:13.320 --> 00:15.900
while also strengthening your skin barrier.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.480
Then I layer on the Skin.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.200
Canvas Balm moisturizer,

00:19.200 --> 00:22.920
which is so hydrating and leaves me super moisturized.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.780
Uses hyaluronic acid to hydrate and smooth your skin.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.360
Then I used a cream blush

00:28.360 --> 00:30.500
and some lip gloss for my glowy look.
