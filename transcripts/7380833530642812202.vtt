Always get questions on whether my natural hair is damaged

00:03.121 --> 00:05.561
since I've been straightening it for a year now.

00:05.562 --> 00:06.801
The answer is no.

00:06.802 --> 00:09.441
I always use the K18 leave in mask.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.561
I always make sure to work it through my hair.

00:11.562 --> 00:14.601
Let it sit for five minutes before brushing my hair.

00:14.602 --> 00:17.081
This mask helps me repair any damage,

00:17.082 --> 00:19.921
strengthens my hair, but also makes it super soft.

00:19.922 --> 00:22.941
I also love that I don't have to wash this out

00:22.960 --> 00:25.440
after blow drying my hair and straightening it.

00:25.441 --> 00:27.801
I go in with the hair repair oil.

00:27.802 --> 00:29.401
You only need a couple drops.

00:29.402 --> 00:33.081
You can use as a finishing oil or apply it on damp hair

00:33.082 --> 00:37.021
and it helps me reduce any frizz and add shine to my hair.
