00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.320
So, keeping on the theme of a mental health day,

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:05.761
um, my husband and I have been doing a little dry patch,

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:08.161
a little sober journey, um,

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:10.401
for about, I wanna say six weeks now.

00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:13.861
But one thing that we have been looking for are mocktails

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.300
and drinks with adaptogens and or other fun

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.280
side effects. So these kept popping up on my TikTok shop forever.

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:27.801
So I have heard so much about microdosing, um,

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.881
mushrooms and, of course,

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:30.641
you know, the green.

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:31.681
The green living.

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:34.901
So I decided to try these out because,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.240
you know, a mom can get a little stressed, and I.

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:40.141
And people swear by this,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.160
just for reference.

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:41.961
I'm, like,

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:42.801
very much a lightweight,

00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:43.521
so I'll drink, like,

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:45.521
half of this and feel, like,

00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:47.221
just kind of loosen the goose.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.200
Also, always be responsible.

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:50.281
My husband is home,

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:51.441
so I'm not, like,

00:00:51.442 --> 00:00:52.521
alone with my kids.

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:53.561
It's the end of the night,

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:56.741
and it's kind of replacing the glass of wine that we used to have.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.640
Cheers.
