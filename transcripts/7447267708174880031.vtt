00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.640
in case you needed a reminder that normal houses look lived in

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.280
and good moms are messy this is it

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:05.560
as much as I try to do it all

00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:07.440
I just can't I can't homeschool

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.600
cook nutritious meals keep the house clean

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.120
and do all of the laundry all the time

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:13.080
so my house looks lived in 24 seven

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.800
because three out of the four of us are here pretty much all the time

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:18.160
and even though I'm a stay at home mom and don't work outside the house

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:20.400
my husband has zero expectation of me doing this all on my own

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.520
there are some days that he comes home to a clean house and a home cooked meal

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.280
but there are more days that he comes home to a complete disaster

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:28.040
whether the disaster is the house or me

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:29.880
he never knows I like to keep him on his toes

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:30.360
but today

00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:32.800
I used the four hours of free time I had while the kids were at farm school

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:33.920
to deep clean our master bedroom

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:36.600
I need at least one space in my house completely clean

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:38.760
because it's off limits to the kids until after Christmas

00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:40.220
it might actually stay clean
