00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
If you invite me over and you explain a game to me, fine.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.600
It's all. It's good.

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.321
I'll try my best to learn it,

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:08.881
baby. Secret Hitler, whatever.

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:10.881
I'll adapt to your culture. Like,

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:12.421
I will make an effort.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.480
But if we're a few drinks in and you pull out some cards

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.421
and we are not playing go fish,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.440
they're like. You started explaining,

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:22.441
like, intricate rules,

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:25.261
and I don't. It's, um, a form of torture.
