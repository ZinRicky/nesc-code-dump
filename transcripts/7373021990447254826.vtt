00:00.000 --> 00:00.440
This morning

00:00.441 --> 00:03.601
my toddlers woke up with a cough and a little bit of a sore throat,

00:03.602 --> 00:06.521
and I don't usually keep cough drops or traditional

00:06.522 --> 00:07.321
medicine in the house,

00:07.322 --> 00:08.761
so let's make some.

00:08.762 --> 00:09.961
Wanted to make lemon,

00:09.962 --> 00:12.361
ginger, and elderberry cough drops.

00:12.362 --> 00:16.481
I poured some honey into my pot and then moved on to peeling my ginger.

00:16.482 --> 00:18.241
Didn't wanna use too much ginger

00:18.242 --> 00:20.641
cause I didn't want it to be too spicy for them,

00:20.642 --> 00:21.921
so I just eyeballed it

00:21.922 --> 00:25.681
and then also added some elderberry and about half a lemon.

00:25.682 --> 00:28.881
You can definitely adjust this to whatever you wanna do.

00:28.882 --> 00:31.041
After I added all my ingredients to my honey,

00:31.042 --> 00:32.641
I gave it a good stir

00:32.642 --> 00:34.321
and boiled it on the stove

00:34.322 --> 00:37.321
until it reached about 300 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:37.322 --> 00:39.281
In the meantime, I prepped my mold.

00:39.282 --> 00:42.821
Since my honey was hot enough and reached the hard crack stage,

00:42.840 --> 00:44.480
I spooned it into my mold.

00:44.481 --> 00:46.961
I had to work quickly because towards the end

00:46.962 --> 00:48.901
my honey began to thicken.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.240
Pop those in the fridge to harden quicker

00:51.241 --> 00:53.201
and then when they were cooled off,

00:53.202 --> 00:54.761
pop them out of their molds.

00:54.762 --> 00:58.121
I laid them on some aero root powder to prevent them from sticking,

00:58.122 --> 01:01.081
but you can also use cornstarch or powdered sugar.

01:01.082 --> 01:02.821
These were so soothing.
