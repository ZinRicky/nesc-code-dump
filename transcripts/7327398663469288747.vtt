00:00.160 --> 00:02.280
In New York for a very exciting shoot.

00:02.280 --> 00:04.720
And I wonder whether you guys can pick up on what it is

00:04.720 --> 00:06.620
based on the hints in this video.

00:06.800 --> 00:07.920
But for some reason,

00:07.920 --> 00:09.400
I'm unable to sleep in.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.420
I wake up at 7 every morning regardless.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.400
So I woke up

00:13.400 --> 00:15.840
and decided to just use that time to read my book

00:15.840 --> 00:17.240
that I still have not finished.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.960
And I've been reading it for three months.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.920
I wrote lucky a little note to find while I'm gone.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.820
Started getting ready for the day.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.720
Bucky swears by icing his face every morning

00:26.720 --> 00:27.400
and every night,

00:27.400 --> 00:29.460
so he's been getting me into that.

00:29.520 --> 00:32.320
And it is so cold that it's almost painful.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.080
But my skin always looks and feels amazing after.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.860
So I might have to do this a little bit more often.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.640
I've been craving the tuna cotto sandwich from Joe

00:40.640 --> 00:42.440
and the juice for so long now,

00:42.440 --> 00:44.660
so that's the first thing I had to get.

00:44.680 --> 00:48.380
I got the spicy tuna cotto with extra avocado.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.320
Lucky just went to get that for me.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.200
And after I had breakfast,

00:52.200 --> 00:54.800
I realized that I was running a little late.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.120
So I got dressed really quick and headed over to set.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.640
I had a later call time today,

00:59.640 --> 01:00.800
which was really nice,

01:00.800 --> 01:02.880
cause usually it's around 6 a m.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.240
And today was 12:30.

01:04.240 --> 01:05.720
So I love that.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.000
But my hair and makeup done

01:07.000 --> 01:08.240
and the note that I left,

01:08.240 --> 01:10.200
lucky asked whether he can surprise me.

01:10.200 --> 01:10.840
With dinner.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.040
And he found that note

01:12.040 --> 01:14.720
and said that he's gonna set something up.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.800
So I was very curious what that was gonna be like.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.480
Wrapped about six hours later,

01:19.480 --> 01:21.300
and I headed back to the hotel.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.200
At this point,

01:22.200 --> 01:24.680
I was absolutely exhausted,

01:24.680 --> 01:27.160
but so excited to go on a little date night.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.940
So I did a really quick makeup look,

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
got dressed,

01:31.000 --> 01:32.700
and we headed out to dinner.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.520
I'm very glad lucky checked in.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.680
What I was craving today,

01:35.680 --> 01:37.660
because this hit the spot.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.280
But nothing describes the feeling of getting into bed

01:40.280 --> 01:41.226
after a long day.
