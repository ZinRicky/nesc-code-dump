00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.020
Come with me on a date night to coltora in Charleston.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.760
Matt and I have been dying to try this place

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:06.841
since it's been nominated for a James Beard Award.

00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:09.441
Coltora is known for creative twists on Filipino food,

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.721
so we were really excited to just be surprised.

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:13.161
Started with the arroz caldo,

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:14.881
which was spicy and umami,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:18.081
like a hug in a bowl. They also tried one of their crudo dishes,

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:19.881
and I just love the presentation on this.

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:21.481
The pink glass with the pink tuna.

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:24.441
It was delicious. I'm a humongous noodle girl.

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:27.201
So when they said that they had a carbonara on the menu,

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:29.501
I was down. Look at that noodle pole.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.800
Everything had a flavor of being familiar,

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:33.921
but also incredibly surprising.

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:35.241
Definitely make a reservation, though,

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:36.561
because dining room is small.

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:38.221
Let me know if you've checked it out.
