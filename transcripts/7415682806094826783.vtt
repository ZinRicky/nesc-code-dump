00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
Let me show you. So this is what the sleeves look like. Off.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.080
They really are just a crochet.

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:09.501
There's no give. This is like just straight cotton yarn.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.200
It does keep me warm like a blanket.

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:13.201
It really. I mean,

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:15.361
you're wearing a crochet blanket.

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:17.041
It just also has arms like it.

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:19.301
So the arms are a little baggy,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.640
you know what I mean? There's no give,

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:23.361
but they are big. They also,

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:24.841
for me, I'm a little bit tall.

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:27.041
They don't come all the way to my wrist,

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:28.801
do you know what I mean? It's a little short,

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:31.641
so sometimes I even just do this. It.

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:34.061
For me, I'm wearing it cause it feels like it's a blanket.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.680
But yeah,

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.301
that's what the arms look like.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.460
And I also pull it up a little bit to make it feel like.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.140
And fold it. But the arms can be.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.920
I don't know. I hope I'm showing you the arms

00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:50.181
good for me. They don't come all the way down.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.280
I don't know. Okay.

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:53.541
I hope that's helping.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.640
Like, you can pull it.

00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.641
I can go like that. But then I kind of.

00:00:57.642 --> 00:01:01.661
And that's when it all kind of fell off my shoulder a little bit, so.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.240
But no, there's no flexibility.

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:05.861
It's literally like just straight cotton yarn,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.460
you know what I mean? It is just.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.820
There ain't much to it. There's no.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.320
It's stretching because it's a crochet thing,

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:17.561
you know what I mean? Because it's just Like,

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:22.381
widening the pattern, but the fabric itself does not have give. No.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.460
I super hope that helps.
