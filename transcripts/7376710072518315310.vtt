00:00.040 --> 00:02.680
Yes, I wear makeup pretty much every day around my husband.

00:02.681 --> 00:03.441
And here's why.

00:03.442 --> 00:05.481
Back when I was single and I would go on dates,

00:05.482 --> 00:07.561
I would get already right.

00:07.562 --> 00:08.681
I would put on makeup,

00:08.682 --> 00:09.801
I would do my hair,

00:09.802 --> 00:11.241
I would spray on some perfume.

00:11.242 --> 00:14.841
I would want to present my best to the guys I was going on dates with.

00:14.842 --> 00:17.081
So I figured that if those guys,

00:17.082 --> 00:20.001
those random guys that I wasn't even committed to,

00:20.002 --> 00:21.121
that weren't committed to me,

00:21.122 --> 00:22.481
that were just taking me on a date,

00:22.482 --> 00:24.801
if they got to see the best side of me,

00:24.802 --> 00:26.321
the most put together side of me,

00:26.322 --> 00:27.241
should my husband,

00:27.242 --> 00:30.841
who loves me and who I love and who has done so much for me,

00:30.842 --> 00:32.601
shouldn't he get to see that side of me, too?

00:32.602 --> 00:33.441
And obviously,

00:33.442 --> 00:35.321
I don't think he even really cares.

00:35.322 --> 00:36.841
Like, I could wear no makeup,

00:36.842 --> 00:37.881
he'd be perfectly happy.

00:37.882 --> 00:40.081
I do think it's more of like, a mentality thing.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.521
Just personally, for me,

00:41.522 --> 00:44.641
it's a way for me to remember how much he means to me

00:44.642 --> 00:46.201
and how important he is to me

00:46.202 --> 00:48.481
and how much I wished when I was single

00:48.482 --> 00:50.281
that someone like him would come along.

00:50.282 --> 00:51.561
And now that I have him,

00:51.562 --> 00:54.641
I just like staying in that kind of mode.

00:54.642 --> 00:56.681
And obviously, that has a lot to do, too,

00:56.682 --> 00:58.641
with my attitude and my personality.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.921
You don't go on a date with someone and nag them the whole time.

01:00.922 --> 01:02.741
And So I really do try.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.040
When he comes home from work

01:04.041 --> 01:05.641
and when we're together on the weekends and stuff,

01:05.642 --> 01:07.781
I try to be pleasant.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.280
And sometimes that doesn't just come naturally.

01:11.281 --> 01:14.361
Sometimes it's something that you need to do very consciously.

01:14.362 --> 01:15.521
And so for me,

01:15.522 --> 01:18.601
just to get into that mindset and get into that way of thinking,

01:18.602 --> 01:19.481
I like to get ready,

01:19.482 --> 01:20.601
I like to do my makeup,

01:20.602 --> 01:24.041
I like to do my hair and try and just get into that mode of, like,

01:24.042 --> 01:25.121
I'm in love with this guy,

01:25.122 --> 01:27.881
you know? And we've been married for 10 years now,

01:27.882 --> 01:31.121
and I have tried to do that most of the time we've been married.

01:31.122 --> 01:31.721
Obviously, like,

01:31.722 --> 01:35.201
I've had kids and I've been sick, and he's seen me at my lowest,

01:35.202 --> 01:36.841
obviously. But

01:36.842 --> 01:39.241
I have found that it is something that really helps me

01:39.242 --> 01:40.921
put the most into our marriage.

01:40.922 --> 01:43.121
And it is just honestly fun.

01:43.122 --> 01:43.921
I like doing it.

01:43.922 --> 01:48.341
It's fun. So if you're kind of in a rut and you kind of just wanna, like,

01:48.400 --> 01:49.000
not necessarily,

01:49.001 --> 01:49.881
like, spice things up,

01:49.882 --> 01:52.001
but you want to be a better wife,

01:52.002 --> 01:53.121
you wanna be a better spouse,

01:53.122 --> 01:54.281
you wanna be a better partner,

01:54.282 --> 01:56.201
I recommend getting ready,

01:56.202 --> 01:57.041
doing some makeup,

01:57.042 --> 02:00.721
putting on a cute outfit before you see your husband.

02:00.722 --> 02:02.073
It's worked really well for us.
