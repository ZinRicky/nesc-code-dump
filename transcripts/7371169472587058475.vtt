00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
By far the hardest thing I experienced as a mom of kids who are, like,

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:06.121
9 and 8 is the constant fighting between each other.

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:07.961
Like, I remember this from when I was a kid,

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:08.401
but, like,

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:11.121
when my sister would breathe a certain way or, like,

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:13.341
look out my window of the car,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.080
it was like nails on a chalkboard, and I wanted to punch her face in.

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:18.921
That's just sibling stuff, right?

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:23.061
Never had I ever thought how physically annoying

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.740
that probably was to my parents,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.480
but now I get it.

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:29.441
Now I get it. And don't get me wrong,

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:31.161
my two older kids get along,

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:32.241
are best friends,

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:33.641
like, hate to be separated,

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.481
but they also never leave each other's, like,

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:36.841
personal space bubble.

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:40.641
So much so that they have now asked to have a joint boy girl room

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:42.241
where they can sleep in the same room together.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:42.641
So, like,

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:45.041
their buds, these are not like fights.

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.201
These are more like,

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:49.581
let me poke and see how you much you can take.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.120
But you know who can't take it?

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:53.701
You know who can't take it anymore?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.640
Me! Referee.

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:59.341
Parenting requires all the patience.
