00:00.000 --> 00:01.280
I was about to go to bed

00:01.281 --> 00:04.121
when I realized that dinner just wasn't quite enough.

00:04.122 --> 00:06.681
I've been craving kimchi chicken all day today.

00:06.682 --> 00:10.341
It's so quick to make, so I made it before heading back to bed.

00:10.360 --> 00:13.400
Started with my broth, which was some daikon, radish,

00:13.401 --> 00:15.641
also half of a green onion,

00:15.642 --> 00:18.041
like using the root part for my broth,

00:18.042 --> 00:19.741
and some dried anchovies.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.040
I took the head off and lucky helped me getting out all the guts

00:23.041 --> 00:24.921
since they were on the smaller side.

00:24.922 --> 00:28.081
And then filled my pot with some water and my green onion,

00:28.082 --> 00:29.041
the anchovies

00:29.042 --> 00:33.201
and daikon before letting that simmer for about 25 minutes.

00:33.202 --> 00:34.161
While that was going,

00:34.162 --> 00:38.541
I found some pork belly that I diced up before straining my broth.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.960
Fried up my pork belly, added my chopped up kimchi

00:41.961 --> 00:46.281
and let that saute for a minute before I added in my broth

00:46.282 --> 00:48.241
some fermented red chili paste,

00:48.242 --> 00:50.561
some chili flakes, a little bit of sugar,

00:50.562 --> 00:52.081
sesame oil, salt,

00:52.082 --> 00:54.281
some soy sauce, give that good mix.

00:54.282 --> 00:56.641
And then added in some of my kimchi brine.

00:56.642 --> 01:00.681
While that was going, I chopped up some green onion and also some tofu.

01:00.682 --> 01:04.441
I let that simmer for another five minutes and then it was time to eat.

01:04.442 --> 01:08.281
I always burn my tongue because I'm so impatient and I can't wait,

01:08.282 --> 01:12.308
but this was so divine and exactly what I needed to put me to sleep.
