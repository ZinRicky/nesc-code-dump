People don't actually understand that if you're nice to your partner,

00:03.721 --> 00:05.201
your wife, your husband,

00:05.202 --> 00:07.881
they're most likely gonna be nice to you.

00:07.882 --> 00:11.121
They're gonna be more likely to help you take out the garbage,

00:11.122 --> 00:12.801
clean the kitchen, cook for you.

00:12.802 --> 00:15.041
You ever notice that whenever you're cranky

00:15.042 --> 00:16.801
and you let it out on your partner,

00:16.802 --> 00:19.081
they're gonna return that same energy to you?

00:19.082 --> 00:22.341
Understanding your emotions and how they affect your relationship

00:22.440 --> 00:25.700
is one of the most important things in a relationship.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.520
So don't forget, if you want a happy life and a happy marriage,

00:29.521 --> 00:32.941
make sure that you're also exuding that same energy.
