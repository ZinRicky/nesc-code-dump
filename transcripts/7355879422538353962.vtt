00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.500
It work.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.480
So I've been wanting to teach river how to cut up her own fruit

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.581
because she's always, like,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.500
wanting to cook and do stuff with me.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.760
But I'm not quite ready. Just to let you free with this.

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:16.321
Right. That perfect slice on the tops off of this.

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:18.761
So I can easily just slice some tops off

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:21.741
and then let her have at it with the rest of the fruit.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.260
You like, kind of green fruit.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.600
Is this mine? Obviously,

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:27.801
I am still teaching her knife safety

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:30.401
and teaching her how to cut strawberries.

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:32.721
But with this, I can just cut the tops off and just.

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:34.441
Just walk away and let her have at it.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:35.821
See how you slice them all up?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.740
Wow. Is that hard to push down, or is it pretty easy?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.200
Pretty easy. Pretty easy.

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.441
Easy for you with strawberries.

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:43.061
But it's not sharp for your fingers, huh?

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.480
No, no. Perfect.

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:47.361
Thirty six dollars and sixteen cents for two of them,

00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:48.821
and you get two in the pack.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.960
Two would be perfect to slice, um,

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:52.321
vegetables or fruit at the same time.

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:54.041
You can definitely use this with strawberries,

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:55.481
eggs, any kind of fruit.

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:56.321
Probably grapes.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:59.241
