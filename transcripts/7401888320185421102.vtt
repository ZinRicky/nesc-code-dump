00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
I think I just figured out why Disney movies kill off the parents.

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:04.561
I'm a huge Disney adult,

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:07.541
and other than knowing that Walt probably had some, like,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.200
very complex dramatic issues with his own parents,

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:13.921
I think it's also because all of these adventures and all of these

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:17.161
like, dangerous situations that these main characters

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:19.241
who are children get themselves into

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:21.161
or adolescents get themselves into

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:24.001
would never happen if they had their mom or dad around.

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.441
Like Elsa not being able to negotiate her powers.

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:28.641
Her parents would have helped her emotional regulate.

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:30.781
Cinderella being abused by her stepmother

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.700
never would have happened if her dad was around.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.120
Belle basically having to be a caretaker for her father

00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:36.681
and take places with her dad

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.141
who found himself in like

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.620
Beast jail never would have happened.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.360
The mom would never let that happen.

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:45.761
Who else would be able to counsel Ariel through her like,

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:48.681
cross species crush? Better than a mom

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.401
who's probably already crushed on a couple humans in her day?

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:53.241
They have to not have parents,

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:56.541
because if they had good parents or a present parent,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.480
none of these adventures would happen.

00:00:58.481 --> 00:01:02.361
They're too dangerous or are a result of terrible advice.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.581
Having a solid nuclear family would almost like ruin the whole thing.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.740
Tarzan wouldn't be raised by gorillas.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.840
He probably would have found his way back to England

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:12.121
cause his parents would have gotten them rescued.

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:14.961
I think Mulan is the only one who has A solid mom and dad.

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:18.421
And honestly, she was sacrificing herself for her father,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.660
which she had to do in the middle of the night

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.080
because her parents would never.

00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:25.041
Her parents would never be okay with that.

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:26.281
So maybe in some sort of way,

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:28.141
it's kind of sweet that they're all orphans.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.540
Or at least that's how I'm gonna look at it from now on.
