00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.880
No, I post about this thing a lot,

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:02.961
but I really fucking love it.

00:00:02.962 --> 00:00:06.501
And I really love it because it charges my phone

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.980
and then I use the second cord to charge my magnetic power bank.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.560
So that while I'm out,

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:19.061
if my phone dies,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm not like, fuck,

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:20.721
I'm not at my car.

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.201
I don't have to wait till my car,

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:24.361
cause sometimes I don't know where the fuck I am and I need, like,

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:25.501
directions now.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.360
So I've had to, like,

00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:28.761
sit in my car and wait for to charge before I can even get going.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.721
So I really fucking love this thing.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:31.321
And this thing.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.461
Both of these things are from the TikTok shop, so.
