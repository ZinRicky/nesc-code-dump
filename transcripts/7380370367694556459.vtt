00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.780
Take care by Madeline Rosenberg.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.260
Illustrated by Juliana Gregory.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.100
Take care of the world, of the mountains and trees.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.060
Tend to the world all the bumbles and bees.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.340
Color the world with greens and with blues.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.580
Light up the world with the words that you choose.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.500
Hope for the world through the storms that may come.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.420
Help heal the world with Te Kun O Lam.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.660
Reach out to the world,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.340
to the big and the small.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.100
Share the wide world.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.900
It belongs to us all.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.520
Te Kuno Lam, Hebrew for repairing the world,

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.441
is a fundamental Jewish value,

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:48.421
not to mention a lifelong intergenerational project.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.040
According to the Torah,

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:51.981
the first five books of the Bible,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.800
God created the world in six days,

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:56.821
but gave human beings the task of helping care for it.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.320
The world is a wondrous place,

00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:00.261
but it is also a work in progress.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.100
It is everyone's job to pitch in and make it even better.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.800
As Rabbi Tarfone,

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.921
a first century sage, said,

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:08.441
it is not your responsibility

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:10.721
to finish the work of perfecting the world,

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:13.901
but you are not free to desist from it either.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.960
Repairing the world may feel like a very big job,

00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:19.301
but it can be tackled with many small acts.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.680
The famous 20th century Rabbi

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.441
Abraham Joshua Hessles

00:01:23.442 --> 00:01:27.061
message to young people was that every little deed counts,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.260
every word has power.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.260
Even little kids can take part into Kuno Lam.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.940
Whether we pick up a piece of litter on The sidewalk

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.660
pause to make sure a turtle crosses the road safely,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.500
or offer a kind word to a new classmate.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.100
Every one of us can help care for our planet and its inhabitants,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.900
all its bumbles and bees every day.
