00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.240
listen up if you wanna assert your dominance as a woman say,

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:08.321
in circumstances where another girl is flirting with your man in front of you

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:10.001
here is what you should do!

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:11.841
do not do not be like

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:14.161
“he's taken, he's mine”

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:15.361
don't do that!

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:17.561
this only makes you seem unconfident

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:21.381
or makes you seem like you need to control your man in front of her

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.080
no, you don't do that!

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:26.159
instead, what you should do is..

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.121
do nothing,

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:28.641
absolutely nothing!

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:31.521
just simply stand there and watch from afar

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:32.561
or right there

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:34.041
just watch/observe

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:35.361
that’s the power move

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:40.561
I've been in situations where randos would just come up to me and my partner

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:43.001
and I'm sure they didn't make the obvious assumption

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.581
that the girl right beside him is his woman

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.160
they’ll try and shoot their shot

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:48.761
okay what do they do?

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:51.221
they come up to him say “hi

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.020
I'm blah blah blah”

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.080
touch his arms

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:57.361
start laughing a little too hard at everything he's saying

00:00:57.362 --> 00:00:58.821
I know he's funny, he's mine

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.380
that's besides the point.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.120
what do you instinctively probably want to do?

00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:05.141
Maybe grab a drink and throw it in her face??

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.840
but don't! don't do anything

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.601
just watch/observe

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.321
he's a grown adult man!

00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:14.961
I don't need to tell him how to shut it down or when to shut it down

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:16.341
he can do it himself!

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.660
We do not need to train grown men good manners

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.140
We don't need to tell them how to appropriately react when a girl walks up to them

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.120
it’s his responsibility to shut it down and let her know that he's taken

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.881
the biggest power move is simply do nothing

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:33.161
ladies just watch/observe

00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:34.521
he should be shutting you down!

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:35.521
and if he's not,

00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:37.461
then maybe he's not the one.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.440
Maybe, he doesn't deserve to be your man.

00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:42.261
never ever force situations

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.020
or have to remind your man what he has

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.500
he should already know

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.040
watch/observe

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.501
watch how it plays out

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.280
please just stand back

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:54.001
to acknowledge the full situation at hand

00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:55.481
you know especially if you're drinking

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.141
some things might be interpreted differently

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.080
but just watch/observe

00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:04.863
So take this advice freely on how to assert your dominance as a woman
