00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.280
I wanted my husband to come home from the office

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:03.441
to eat lunch with me today,

00:00:03.442 --> 00:00:05.621
so I told him I was making a Mcchicken.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.360
It worked. I mixed up my sourdough buns the night before

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:10.501
using my primitive wheat and corn,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.560
the healthiest wheat on earth

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.841
because it hasn't been altered in the lab to have more gluten

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:15.241
and isn't sprayed with glyphosate.

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:16.881
This took about 10 minutes of prep time

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.601
and in the morning it was perfectly fermented.

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:21.361
I shaped the dough into eight sourdough buns using a dough scraper

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:22.961
and rolled each bun into a round ball,

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:25.881
then let those rise about two hours on a our baking sheet.

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:27.121
Around 11:00am,

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:29.801
I place the buns in the oven to bake for about 12 minutes

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:31.161
while I prepared the nugget center

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:33.721
by removing breasts and legs from my whole pasture raised chicken.

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:35.481
I turn these pieces into chopped chicken

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:37.521
by using the escalator in a food processor.

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:39.241
Next I mixed up my flour dunk,

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:40.841
a combination of iron corn flour,

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:42.341
salt, pepper and spices,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.960
making round patties about three and a/2 ounces in size.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.161
I dunk each in the flour, then into the same mixture,

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:49.561
which I later added baking soda and water to.

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:51.201
This went straight into hot schmaltz

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:52.761
and cooked for several minutes per side

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:55.281
until crispy and golden. While the nuggets sizzled in the pan,

00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:57.121
I finely chopped some iceberg lettuce

00:00:57.122 --> 00:00:58.781
and whipped up some homemade Mayo.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200
When the nugget came out of the pan,

00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:03.661
I placed A bun into the hot smelts and let that get nice and golden.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.120
Then I prepared the Mcchicken by first spreading the Mayo,

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:07.921
then layering with a handful of iceberg,

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:10.681
and lastly the nugget. My husband walked in the door

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:12.761
just as I finished compiling his Mcchicken.

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:15.441
We both enjoyed the best sandwich we've ever bitten into,

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.761
although I was nervous to see what he really thought.

00:01:17.762 --> 00:01:20.481
He turned out loving it, just as I hoped he would,

00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:23.701
so I'm sure I'll be able to get him back home for lunch in the future.
