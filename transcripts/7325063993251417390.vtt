00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.420
let's talk about the problems when you romanticize a 1950s homemaker aesthetic

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.520
coming from someone who's a full time

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:11.700
stay at home mom homemaker who loves a vintage moment

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.080
the reason videos like this can be met with negative response

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:19.820
is because it's erasing the entire domestic labor force that was depended upon

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.660
by these upper middle class white stay at home moms

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.560
the traditional housewife of the 1950s

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:28.800
1960s was never meant to do everything by themselves

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.660
they always had domestic labor

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.800
and honestly

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:33.560
since the Industrial Revolution

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:37.420
these ideas of ornamental upper class white housewives

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.040
were an offshoot and a demonstration of their husband's wealth

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.860
so these were not women who were expected to lift a finger

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.920
and yes we can idealize the fashions and the styles of the 1950s

00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:54.520
and still enjoy being stay home wives and homemakers and mothers

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:57.700
while acknowledging the labor that made that possible
