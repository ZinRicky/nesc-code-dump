00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.520
We are gonna make some pickled veggies.

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:06.901
Apple cider vinegar that I tried to make. Did not turn out so well.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.460
Amazing sprouts brand cucumber onions.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.780
The exact same thing for both pickled onions and pickled cucumbers.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.020
Oh my god.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.220
I always just guess with the apple cider vinegar.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.160
That's probably enough.

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:32.721
Apple cider vinegar is the one

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:35.801
specifically that helps with blood sugar regulation.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:38.041
Also amazing for stimulating bile production,

00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:41.361
which if you have digestive issues, it's amazing.

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:43.381
I add peppercorns

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.400
it off with some clean water.

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:48.521
Just fill it to the top.

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:49.981
Not using tap water

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.940
for some lids on 48 hours at least is when it's gonna be like the best.
