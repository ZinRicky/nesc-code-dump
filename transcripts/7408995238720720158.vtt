00:00.000 --> 00:00.900
So

00:03.000 --> 00:04.900
today is a kitchen restock day.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.040
I'm gonna show you my little OOTD sourdough bread

00:08.041 --> 00:09.321
because we're doing stretching folds.

00:09.322 --> 00:11.861
So this is like my baby attached to my hip

00:13.080 --> 00:15.160
apron from World Market. That a long time ago.

00:15.161 --> 00:19.681
My only apron. I need to get more because she is starting to wear off.

00:19.682 --> 00:21.961
And then dress is from H M.

00:21.962 --> 00:24.681
I got it a long time ago. Um,

00:24.682 --> 00:26.201
and I'm finally starting to wear it.

00:26.202 --> 00:30.001
And then sandals are from Riza.

00:30.002 --> 00:31.641
They are grounding barefoot sandals,

00:31.642 --> 00:33.841
so love that for me. Um,

00:33.842 --> 00:34.321
and, yeah,

00:34.322 --> 00:35.319
this is what we got going on.
