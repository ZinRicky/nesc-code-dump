00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.475
my late nan was the type of woman 

00:00:01.476 --> 00:00:03.240
who could throw together an incredible meal

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:04.680
with seemingly nothing in the cupboard 

00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:06.320
and my favourite was always her Galette

00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:07.560
and my take on her recipe

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:10.720
is gonna be my submission to the Wattie’s 90th birthday cookbook

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:12.840
if you wanna submit your own Wattie’s Creation

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:13.818
check the caption

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.200
A galette is like a free form tart

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.160
you can make it sweet or you can make it savoury

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.440
I start by making the dough

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:20.560
wrapping it up before popping it in the fridge to chill

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:21.920
while I get started on the filling

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:25.400
then we slice three red onions before popping them into a heated oil pan

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:28.280
and sauteing with some brown sugar and balsamic vinegar

00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:29.720
until they start to caramelise

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.880
to that I add some Wattie’s Free Flow Spinach 

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:34.080
and give it a few minutes until it's all cooked

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:36.160
Then you wanna roll your dough out into a rough circle

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.840
and the best thing about this dish is the more rustic it looks

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:40.640
the better so it doesn't need to be perfect

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.200
pile on your filling leaving a bit of a border around the edge

00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:45.600
and I'm topping that with a can of Wattie’s Sliced Beetroot 

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.155
toasted walnuts, feta and a drizzle of honey 

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:50.200
or hot honey if you're feeling spicy

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:53.800
and then you wanna kind of fold the pastry in to create almost like little pleats

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:54.840
brush it with an egg wash

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:56.640
bake it and then top with fresh thyme

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:58.880
this dish is quick easy and flavoursome

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:01.019
