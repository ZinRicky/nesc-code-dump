00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
As somebody who has done a lot of things in life,

00:02.241 --> 00:03.321
travelled around,

00:03.322 --> 00:04.601
I moved away for college,

00:04.602 --> 00:05.601
I earned a degree,

00:05.602 --> 00:06.881
I worked in news,

00:06.882 --> 00:08.281
I've met a lot of really cool,

00:08.282 --> 00:09.241
famous people.

00:09.242 --> 00:12.621
I have to say that there is nothing more adventurous,

00:12.640 --> 00:13.600
more fulfilling,

00:13.601 --> 00:15.721
more exciting than motherhood.

00:15.722 --> 00:16.681
And I know it's, like,

00:16.682 --> 00:18.481
controversial to say in this day and age.

00:18.482 --> 00:19.681
Like, I'm not supposed to talk about it.

00:19.682 --> 00:20.401
I'm supposed to be like,

00:20.402 --> 00:21.721
you know, it's not that great.

00:21.722 --> 00:22.481
Like, motherhood's not that great.

00:22.482 --> 00:24.521
I'm just tired of having to water it down.

00:24.522 --> 00:26.781
Motherhood is freaking amazing.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.720
And I do think a lot of younger girls,

00:28.721 --> 00:29.801
a lot of younger women

00:29.802 --> 00:31.881
pay attention to the way that we talk about motherhood,

00:31.882 --> 00:32.641
and they notice.

00:32.642 --> 00:34.481
They notice that we complain about motherhood,

00:34.482 --> 00:37.961
they notice that we glorify being a boss babe instead.

00:37.962 --> 00:40.081
And I think we are seeing the effects of that

00:40.082 --> 00:42.121
as we are seeing a decline in birth rates.

00:42.122 --> 00:42.921
And it's just really kind of sad,

00:43.080 --> 00:46.160
I think a lot of women are missing out on something that is really,

00:46.161 --> 00:46.841
really incredible.

00:46.842 --> 00:48.481
There is nothing like it.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.921
Like, it's insane to watch someone come to earth,

00:51.922 --> 00:54.281
like, watch someone be born and start life

00:54.282 --> 00:56.361
and find out what their personality is like,

00:56.362 --> 00:58.801
and to almost have a chance to relive your childhood again

00:58.802 --> 01:01.161
and watch as they learn about life,

01:01.162 --> 01:02.321
it is incredible.

01:02.322 --> 01:03.481
It is so much fun.

01:03.482 --> 01:04.081
And again, like,

01:04.082 --> 01:07.441
I'm someone who Loves to get the most out of life.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.001
Like, I love having new experiences.

01:09.002 --> 01:10.841
There's so many places I still wanna travel.

01:10.842 --> 01:12.281
There's so many people I wanna meet.

01:12.282 --> 01:13.881
There's different organizations I'm involved in

01:13.882 --> 01:15.401
that I wanna continue to be involved in.

01:15.402 --> 01:16.601
There's things I wanna learn.

01:16.602 --> 01:18.601
I love getting the most out of life.

01:18.602 --> 01:21.481
And one of the best ways to get the most out of life is to have kids

01:21.482 --> 01:22.321
and to raise kids.

01:22.322 --> 01:25.001
And to raise them in this world where you get to teach them,

01:25.002 --> 01:25.601
you get to show them,

01:25.602 --> 01:28.441
you get to give them the kind of childhood that you wish you had.

01:28.442 --> 01:29.201
It's incredible.

01:29.202 --> 01:30.282
It's so much fun.
