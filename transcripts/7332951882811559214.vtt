00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.000
Since I split custody,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.120
and there's times where my kids are gone

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.120
for days at a time,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.920
I like to just head over to my boyfriend's house

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.160
and get some of my work done

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.740
and just do some stuff over there.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.960
And this bag I got from the TikTok shop

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.400
has made my life going back and forth so much easier.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.320
I used to pack, like,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.520
three or four backpacks

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.780
and literally look like I was moving in.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.040
But now I can really,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.580
absolutely pack multiple outfits for multiple days.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.440
I can fit, um,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.460
gym clothes,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.400
extra shoes,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.800
my big ass sweater

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.960
so that I stay warm.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.840
I still have room to put all my little

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.380
extra trinkets and things in my hair product.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.680
This bag has been a true lifesaver.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.200
I absolutely love it.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.120
It's on sale right now on the TikTok shop,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.772
and it's linked right here if you wanna get one.
