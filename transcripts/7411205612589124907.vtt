00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.680
Why do people continue to eat food that's full of toxic chemicals

00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:05.561
over eating, like,

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:06.821
real, natural food?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.360
For example, my mother in law and my husband refuse to use maple syrup

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:14.901
when I make pancakes, waffles, whatever.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.720
They legit refuse. So I have to have maple syrup for my,

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:23.001
me and my kids, and then I have, like,

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.401
Missus Butterworth or whatever,

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:26.561
you know, for.

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:30.601
For them in the pantry. And this has been going on for a few years now.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:31.641
And, you know,

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:33.821
I'm not like, you can't have that in my house.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.240
I prefer it wouldn't be there.

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:37.361
I prefer fake syrups not be used.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:40.121
Um, sometimes my kids will accidentally use it,

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:40.961
and I'm, you know,

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:43.841
I'm not having a freak out about it,

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:45.361
but it's just. Why do you want it?

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:47.561
Why would you want to use that over maple syrup?

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:47.961
Like, I just.

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:49.421
I don't understand. It's like,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.800
Maple syrup taste amazing.

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.821
Like, who doesn't not like maple syrup?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.840
I understand why you'd buy fake syrups over maple syrup

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:58.441
if you feel like, price wise,

00:00:58.442 --> 00:01:02.041
it's cheaper. It's something that people did in the 90s,

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:03.401
you know, in the early 2,

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:08.281
like, nobody even pointed out that these fake syrups are bad for you.

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:11.401
But now we know better, and we know maple syrup is better,

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:13.761
so why not just eat it? The other day,

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:17.401
I made pancakes, and I had thrown the Mrs.

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:20.561
Butterworth away. It got tipped over in the pantry.

00:01:20.562 --> 00:01:22.161
It's Been there for however long?

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:23.701
Um, a few years.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.120
And my husband's currently deployed,

00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:26.401
so there's no one really, to eat it,

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:28.501
and I just threw it away.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.720
And then we all had sat down to eat the pancakes.

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:31.801
I just made, you know,

00:01:31.802 --> 00:01:34.461
raw buttermilk, homemade pancakes from scratch.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.600
And the maple syrup was on the table.

00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:37.361
And she, you know,

00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:39.521
got really upset that the missus bathorus was missing,

00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:41.601
and she just didn't use syrup.

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.101
She'd rather just eat a dry pancake.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.860
Like she ate a dry pancake

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.720
because she'd rather have a dry pancake

00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:51.501
than have maple syrup on her plate. I'm just baffled.
