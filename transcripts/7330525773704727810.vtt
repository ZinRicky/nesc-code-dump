00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.880
These no fuss

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.480
many cinnamon

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.920
scrolls have got me and my whole family in a chokehold.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.760
And Mark my words,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.080
this and every potential variation of this recipe

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.320
is gonna be rinsed and repeated for school lunches

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.200
throughout 2024.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.880
And my favorite thing about this recipe is

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.480
there's no yeast,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.680
so there's no rising time.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.680
So I can just make it,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.680
serve it and be done with it.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.840
Start by sifting two cups of self raising flour

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.440
and a pinch of

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.000
add 90 grams of softened butter

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.320
and rub together with your fingers

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.600
before making a well in the middle

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.040
and adding two thirds of a cup of milk.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.720
Turn it out onto a well flowered surface

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.280
and knead until your dough comes together

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.440
and then roll it out into a rough rectangle shape

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.520
about half a centimeter thick.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.520
And then prepare your filling.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.840
I went with cinnamon obviously,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.440
but equally

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.600
you could do a savory filling

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.880
and make something like pizza scroll.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.440
For my filling,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.120
I mixed 120 grams of butter,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.520
a quarter of a cup of brown sugar,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.640
two teaspoons of white sugar

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.200
and one and a/2 teaspoons of cinnamon.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.800
And when I said that this recipe was easy,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.560
I wasn't kidding.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.240
You just smear your filling all over that dough

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.960
and roll it up

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.920
because I want these to be the

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.240
perfect size for the lunch box.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.200
I've greased a mini muffin tin to make it easier.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.000
And I went to chop my log into 12 pieces

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.400
and I Only ended up with 11.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.640
So my meth wasn't methane,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.440
which meant my triggers were triggered. Anyway,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.000
pop your little scroll babies into the oven at 180

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.080
degrees C for about 20 to 25 minutes

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.320
until they've risen and golden.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.760
And meanwhile,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.600
I made my icing,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.760
which was just one cup of icing sugar to two

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.920
tablespoons of boiling water.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.760
Your family doesn't eat them all at once like mine

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.800
totally would if I let them.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.920
They should keep in the pantry for about 2 or 3 days

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.640
if stored properly.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.200
And this is where the Glad Snap Lock

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.880
resellable sandwich bags are ideal.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.080
Seal changes from blue to green

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.560
so that you know that it's sealed tight,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.560
locking that freshness.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.000
And one thing that I'm trying to get better at

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.080
this year is preparing some lunch box items in

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.280
advance to make the mom life

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.000
chaos a little bit more manageable in the morning.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.040
So if you make a double batch,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.200
just individually wrap them in your glad cling wrap

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.000
and then freeze.
