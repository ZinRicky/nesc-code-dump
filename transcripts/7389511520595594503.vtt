00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.200
on these cold winter nights

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.503
I honestly can't think of anything better than 

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.083
flaky roti and a flavoursome curry 

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:08.200
I actually spotted this recipe on the cover of the latest dish magazine

00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:10.680
and when I saw it I knew I needed to eat it immediately

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:14.040
I started on my marinade by popping my chicken and with some Greek yoghurt

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.120
lime juice gramme masala turmeric

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:17.600
sea salt and ground white pepper

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:21.040
I pop that in the fridge for a few hours and meanwhile got started on my roti

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.240
I sifted 4 cups of plain white flour

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:25.040
added a couple of knobs of cold butter

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.880
added about a teaspoon and a half of salt

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.460
drizzle of olive oil and a cup of boiling water

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.440
give that a little mix and then added another half cup of boiling water

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:34.080
once the dough was starting to come together

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:37.400
I kneaded it on the bench for about 5 minutes before setting it aside to rest

00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:39.040
then I got started on my curry sauce

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:40.800
in a hot wok I combined oil

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:41.800
onion salt

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:42.720
garlic ginger

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:44.520
chillies and unroasted cashews

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:45.920
Fried that off until it was fragrant

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:48.720
then popped it in l my food processor with a little bit of water

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.800
and mixed it until a paste came together

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.600
and now we need to get started on the spices

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:54.400
dry toast cardamom peppercorns

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:56.400
cloves and seeds fenugreek seeds

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:58.640
garam masala ground cumin and white pepper

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.960
pop that into my mortar and pestle and then blasted it until it was a powder

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.080
and it was about at this point

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:05.680
where I realised that this recipe really is a labour of love 

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:07.000
melt together some oil and butter

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.760
then pop in your curry sauce and fry that off for a few minutes

00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:11.400
before adding your marinated chicken

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:13.560
stir in your spices and let that cook for a bit 

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:15.680
then I added a bit more natural Greek yoghurt

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:17.560
some water and half a cup of cream

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:19.600
mix that all together and then just let it simmer

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:21.520
then I turned my attention back to my roti

00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.400
I rolled it into balls then rolled it out

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.160
brushed it with melted butter and oil

00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:28.320
sprinkled it with flour and then folded it up and then folded it again

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.400
once it was all rolled up

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.480
then I kinda gently pulled it apart back into a circular shape

00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:34.280
and then I gave it one final shaping

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:35.880
I popped that into a hot dry pan

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.160
and then the plan here I think is just to keep it moving

00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:39.640
so I was spinning it and flipping it

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.920
before brushing it with some oil and butter mix

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:43.040
and flipping it some more

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.740
I want it to cook and get golden brown but not burnt

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.160
once all of the roti was cooked

00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:51.160
I plated up my curry and my rice and I pop some roti on the side

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:52.280
topped it with fresh coriander

00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:54.520
and oh my goodness I wish you could smell my house

00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:56.680
this meal was so hearty, so flavoursome

00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:58.782
and yeah it took forever but it was worth it
