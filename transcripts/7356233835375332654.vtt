00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.240
Men's relationships always abruptly end, and you're like,

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:03.881
what happened?

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:05.961
You guys seemed so perfect for each other.

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:06.721
They're like, yeah,

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:07.761
she got a little crazy.

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:09.041
Actually, come to think of it,

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.681
she was always a little crazy.

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:11.881
Would scream at me.

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:14.261
I'd always catch her texting her ex, like,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.800
did you not see these red flags in the beginning?

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:20.981
Why do men start dating someone new and ignore all of the red flags?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.009
Men are just way too nice and forgiving.
