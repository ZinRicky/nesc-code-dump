00:00.080 --> 00:03.760
I could be giving birth to my third child in four weeks.

00:03.760 --> 00:05.360
Just so crazy to think about.

00:05.360 --> 00:06.960
I never thought I'd be 22

00:06.960 --> 00:07.840
with three kids,

00:07.840 --> 00:08.900
three and under,

00:08.960 --> 00:12.280
but it's been a very wild ride that I'm so excited for.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.220
So today, let's spend a realistic morning together.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.000
I've been getting the worst sleep,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.480
so I kind of wake up whenever my kids wake up.

00:19.480 --> 00:22.420
So they just hung out with me while I

00:22.440 --> 00:23.760
put down all of my to DOS,

00:23.760 --> 00:24.840
did my scriptures,

00:24.840 --> 00:26.300
and journaled a little bit.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.680
Lately I'm obsessed with robus tea again,

00:28.680 --> 00:31.560
but it has to be with milk and sugar.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.540
There's no other way I'll drink it.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.820
And then I made some pancakes this morning.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.320
Pancakes seem like a very simple thing to do,

00:39.320 --> 00:42.400
but they have not always been my strong soup. But now

00:42.400 --> 00:45.160
I figured out a recipe that actually works really well.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.680
So I made the kids some,

00:46.680 --> 00:48.000
and I had lucky flip them,

00:48.000 --> 00:49.540
which didn't go that great.

00:49.960 --> 00:50.960
Cut up some strawberries.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.480
They always have theirs with some apple sauce,

00:53.480 --> 00:55.480
and lucky has his with maple syrup

00:55.480 --> 00:57.400
and a bunch of strawberries on top.

00:57.400 --> 00:58.800
Once everyone had their breakfast,

00:58.800 --> 00:59.640
I made mine.

00:59.640 --> 01:00.520
I couldn't decide,

01:00.520 --> 01:02.640
so I had some bagel and cream cheese,

01:02.640 --> 01:04.240
and then also some of the pancakes

01:04.240 --> 01:06.420
with some leftover peach puree.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.840
This is usually the time where I respond to emails

01:08.840 --> 01:11.620
and texts and other things that need to be done

01:11.680 --> 01:12.760
in order for lucky

01:12.760 --> 01:14.760
And I to both get work done during the day.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.960
He takes the mornings

01:15.960 --> 01:17.620
and I take the afternoons.

01:17.880 --> 01:18.800
So he clocked out

01:18.800 --> 01:20.040
and I was on kids duty.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.480
So I just did all the breakfast cleanup

01:22.480 --> 01:24.160
since he does the evening cleanup.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.200
I also stained my cutting board,

01:26.200 --> 01:29.000
and the trick that always helps is hot water,

01:29.000 --> 01:30.440
so I made sure to do that.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.280
And then I got the babies dressed

01:32.280 --> 01:33.600
and all ready for the day

01:33.600 --> 01:36.100
before it was finally my turn to get ready.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.680
My skin has been struggling a little bit lately.

01:38.680 --> 01:39.840
It's been really dry,

01:39.840 --> 01:42.580
and I think my eczema is kind of flaring up a little,

01:42.680 --> 01:43.840
but it's not bad at all,

01:43.840 --> 01:45.860
so I'm not even gonna worry about it.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.560
I'm trying to make my hair last a

01:47.560 --> 01:49.240
few more days before I have to wash it,

01:49.240 --> 01:50.800
so I've just been doing half up,

01:50.800 --> 01:52.380
half down hairstyles.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.620
Also, you guys have been asking me for my lip combo.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.480
She's almost the same in every video.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.600
It's the MAC lip liner and Cork,

01:59.600 --> 02:02.440
and then I put the Benedint lip stain in the middle,

02:02.440 --> 02:03.720
top it with a clear gloss.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.240
I also bought some baby stuff the other day

02:06.240 --> 02:07.960
as we're slowly starting to get ready,

02:07.960 --> 02:10.940
and I forgot how tiny their little diapers are.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.520
Pretty much the size of my hand.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.840
I also unbox

02:13.840 --> 02:16.640
some of the packages that came over the last few days.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.640
It was so sweet.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.680
The Tory Burge team sent Me,

02:19.680 --> 02:21.460
the look I wore to their show,

02:21.640 --> 02:22.840
which I can't wait to wear.

02:22.840 --> 02:23.600
And at this point,

02:23.600 --> 02:24.640
I realised that we were

02:24.640 --> 02:26.360
running late to my midwife appointment,

02:26.360 --> 02:28.240
so I made myself a quick smoothie

02:28.240 --> 02:31.320
while lucky got the kids ready and loaded in the car.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.160
My last babies have been home births,

02:33.160 --> 02:35.120
and I've had a midwife with all of them,

02:35.120 --> 02:36.400
so I knew that with this one,

02:36.400 --> 02:38.620
I wanted to do the exact same thing.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.680
Had the most amazing experiences using midwives

02:41.680 --> 02:43.580
and just giving birth at home.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.560
Rumble and slim

02:44.560 --> 02:46.440
love listening to the baby's heartbeat,

02:46.440 --> 02:48.420
and it makes it all feel so real.
