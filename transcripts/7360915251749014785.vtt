00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.500
And I would also like to add that

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.160
even though the Sydney funnel webs are quite venomous

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:11.341
and people do die from Sydney funnel webs,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.640
the Sydney fireworks fighter is not aggressive by nature.

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:19.241
So you have to provoke one of them pretty badly

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:20.201
or like

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:24.721
frighten one pretty badly for it to bite you with its stabby

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:28.601
little fangs. Whereas I feel like men are just more of a mixed bag

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:34.121
like some of them are aggressive by nature and you don't know

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:36.621
like their behaviour can be quite unpredictable.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.280
Um, you usually don't have to provoke them at all for them to show um

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:48.121
aggression or some sort of violence or harassment towards you.

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:50.161
And I had two of these spiders

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:52.761
watching me shower every single day for about 3 months

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:54.381
and they never made a move,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.500
not once.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.040
And I'm sorry but I just can't say that about a single man that I know.

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:02.961
And the other thing about them is that

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:06.021
while their bite can be extremely painful,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.040
it's quite unlikely that I'm going to need 10 years of therapy

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.901
to recover from a Sydney funnel web spider

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.420
which is more than I can say about my ex boyfriend.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.600
And if I got bitten by a Sydney funnel web,

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:24.421
while I might need surgery to cover up the appearance of the scar

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.740
as well as a lot of medical treatment,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.600
that medical treatment would be covered by Medicare,

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.421
which is Australia's public healthcare system.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.200
This is Unlike other issues that are not covered by Medicare,

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.581
such as psychologists

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.160
to deal with the trauma of sexual violence from a man,

00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:45.961
birth control,

00:01:45.962 --> 00:01:49.541
which women are expected to look after majority of the time

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.240
to basically cope with the ongoing threat that it poses

00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:57.121
to get pregnant to a man

00:01:57.122 --> 00:01:58.961
and then be tied to that man for the rest of your life,

00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:00.501
especially if that man is abusive.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.620
Alternative healthcare remedies for um things like vaginismus,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.360
um chronic thrush

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:10.701
and endometriosis that are triggered by sexual violence

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.160
and gynecological appointments

00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:15.121
which are extremely expensive

00:02:15.122 --> 00:02:18.361
and usually you have to pay $250

00:02:18.362 --> 00:02:21.821
just for a man to tell you that your pain is imagined

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.000
but just like men,

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:27.401
all Sydney funnel webs should be treated as potentially dangerous.

00:02:27.402 --> 00:02:29.001
However, unlike men,

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:33.641
only 10 to 15 percent of their bikes are actually venomous

00:02:33.642 --> 00:02:38.561
whereas we know that majority of men have perpetrated sexual violence

00:02:38.562 --> 00:02:41.621
or sexual harassment or coercive control

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.020
or gaslighting on a woman at some point in their lives

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.020
unlike Sydney funnel web spiders,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.440
the other important point to note is that um,

00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:52.461
Sydney funnel web spiders

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.440
can actually just be eradicated with a can of really strong

00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:00.481
bug spray that you can buy from your local supermarket

00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:05.001
whereas it is much harder to eradicate a man from your life

00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:09.801
once he's decided to sink his little fangs into you and destroy you.

00:03:09.802 --> 00:03:12.661
It's gonna cost a lot more than 1299.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.960
It might cost you your life

00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:17.641
Or it might cost you years and years of money in therapy

00:03:17.642 --> 00:03:18.961
and trauma counseling.

00:03:18.962 --> 00:03:22.401
It might cost you your sense of safety or security.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.921
And even if you do try to spray them away,

00:03:24.922 --> 00:03:28.861
there's no guarantee that they won't come back to haunt you.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.280
Or at least, you know,

00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.121
a spider's not gonna go around and tell everyone in its Social Circle

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:36.845
that you're a crazy ex girlfriend.
