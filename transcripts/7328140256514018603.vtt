00:00.080 --> 00:01.400
These are some things I prep

00:01.400 --> 00:03.720
to make my week just a little bit easier.

00:03.720 --> 00:06.560
Usually I use my ripe bananas to make banana bread,

00:06.560 --> 00:09.760
but today I decided to make oatmeal bake muffins.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.680
These are a one bowl recipe as well,

00:11.680 --> 00:13.660
which makes clean up really easy.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.680
So I mixed all of my ingredients

00:15.680 --> 00:17.840
and then chopped up my chocolate

00:17.840 --> 00:20.300
and dried cherries that I'm gonna add to it,

00:20.520 --> 00:22.600
scooped all of that in my little muffin pan,

00:22.600 --> 00:23.840
slid that in the oven.

00:23.840 --> 00:24.840
While those were baking,

00:24.840 --> 00:26.840
I started on my date caramel.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.720
I've been obsessed with having this

00:28.720 --> 00:30.960
with apples and different kinds of fruits.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.160
So I soak my dates

00:32.160 --> 00:34.280
and then blend them up with some coconut milk,

00:34.280 --> 00:37.700
and it comes out tasting exactly like caramel does.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.520
Citrus is the best in winter,

00:39.520 --> 00:41.480
so I always stock up on it.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.840
And I've been loving fresh squeezed orange juice,

00:43.840 --> 00:44.960
not the store bought ones,

00:44.960 --> 00:47.980
so I decided to just make a big glass that I can have

00:48.160 --> 00:49.040
throughout the week.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.520
Also, pulp and orange juice is a must.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.000
Don't even fight me on that.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.540
And I moved on to making a quick Mediterranean salad.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.320
So I chopped up some cucumbers,

00:58.320 --> 00:59.480
some bell peppers,

00:59.480 --> 01:00.600
added some chickpeas,

01:00.600 --> 01:01.520
some feta cheese,

01:01.520 --> 01:02.480
some parsley,

01:02.480 --> 01:05.420
and top that with a balsamic maple dressing.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.960
Stores so well in the fridge.

01:06.960 --> 01:07.880
I eat it with chips,

01:07.880 --> 01:08.840
I eat it on bread,

01:08.840 --> 01:10.420
I eat it by itself.

01:10.520 --> 01:11.360
It's really good

01:11.360 --> 01:12.600
and it doesn't go bad.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.940
Or at least a week.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.320
Then I moved on to making an Asian pickled

01:16.320 --> 01:17.540
cucumber salad.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.960
I love having this.

01:18.960 --> 01:19.960
It's super simple.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.560
I pickled it with some rice vinegar,

01:22.560 --> 01:23.800
sugar, sesame seeds,

01:23.800 --> 01:25.560
chilli, and then

01:25.560 --> 01:28.440
I like prepping one warm and comforting meal.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.780
So today it was a Thai red curry

01:30.880 --> 01:32.400
chopped up on my vegetables

01:32.400 --> 01:33.240
and then fried

01:33.240 --> 01:36.280
some lemongrass and red curry paste in some oil.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.440
Added my coconut milk,

01:37.440 --> 01:38.240
all of my veggies,

01:38.240 --> 01:39.220
some chicken,

01:39.720 --> 01:42.400
let that simmer while I packed up my oatmeal

01:42.400 --> 01:43.420
baked muffins.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.320
Once that was done,

01:44.320 --> 01:46.800
I transferred that over to some glass Tupperware,

01:46.800 --> 01:49.120
let that cool down completely before closing,

01:49.120 --> 01:51.180
and that's what I prepped for this week.
