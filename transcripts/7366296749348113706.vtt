00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
I'm not kidding.

00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:01.761
The supplement,

00:00:01.762 --> 00:00:03.221
Sam E.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.200
And it's not even about.

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:06.321
I'm not making any money.

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:07.361
This isn't about a commission.

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:11.001
It's about just helping other women that maybe feel a little bit sad,

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.041
but you feel like, whoa,

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:12.841
whoa, whoa.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.920
The whole, like,

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.521
pharmaceutical thing scares me a little bit.

00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:17.081
Can I try something a little less first?

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:19.801
Can I. Can I go a slower route before I,

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:22.261
you know, really take a big dive there?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.800
This stuff, it's a natural supplement.

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:25.021
You can look it up yourself.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.920
You can Google it yourself and see that even from safe sources

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.841
like the Mayo Clinic,

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:33.401
it says it has been used to treat other things like osteoarthritis.

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:36.521
But they have found that it does also help treat depression.

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:37.641
And it is safe,

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:39.541
obviously. Talk to your doctor.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.400
My therapist was the one who told me about it.

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:45.421
I have been. I've been going to her for years and on and off.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.280
And then she said,

00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:47.201
well, it sounds like,

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:48.621
you know, with your age and everything,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.440
you know, I don't know,

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:50.241
that you need all the way from.

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:51.721
And she knew where I felt like I was like.

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:53.481
I just don't know that I wanna be all the way on something.

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:54.921
And what if I have insurance problems?

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.681
I don't wanna be on something and stuck on.

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:58.081
I don't know. It's just like,

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.601
well, maybe try this supplement.

00:00:59.602 --> 00:01:02.601
And if they sell it everywhere, so it helps me,

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:03.521
it Helps people.

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:06.101
I'm just trying to help another lady out.
