00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.620
I'd like to know when my beauty ended for you

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.000
this is one of the most powerful statements I have ever heard on this app

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.000
I'd like to know when my beauty ended for you

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:17.740
Doctor Zoe I have a PhD in feminist consciousness raising

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.400
and I wanna talk about it

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:25.080
because it's about when the male fantasy of you drops away

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.760
are you treated differently when he sees you as a person

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:33.060
as a person as a human or less than when the fantasy drops

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.740
we've all experienced it to some degree

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.800
does he treat you differently

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:40.100
you are feminist

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.400
and what I mean by that is

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.960
is your conscience feminist

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.000
has your feminist consciousness been raped

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.240
well our feminist consciousness is raised with me

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:57.780
notice a gap there is a gap between our humanity and reality

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.620
a nice man will tell you that he has a wife and he has a daughter

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.940
and he was raised by a single mother and he respects women

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.080
but that is not what he means when he says that

00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:13.740
he means I respect the women in my life who give me love

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.920
affection and attention I respect the women in my life who I can protect

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:23.240
I respect the women in my life who I see value in

00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:28.080
I respect those women I don't respect women

00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:32.860
we've all gone from being one of those women to being

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.060
a woman who he doesn't respect anymore because we're not behaving

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.980
because we're using in a a body in a way that he doesn't agree with

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.500
because we're too loud or too opinionated

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.200
because we're no longer a woman who he sees value in or who he can control

00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:54.420
then we notice the gap and what happens when we notice the gap

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.620
feminist consciousness is raised

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620
we get angry

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.300
and you know what what happens when women get angry

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.320
we are propelled by kind of a productive feminist rage

00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:11.100
and feminist rage is contagious

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.980
feminist rage is contagious because

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.700
we start talking

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.620
we start acting differently

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.900
acting how we want

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.520
using our opinions using our voice

00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:27.540
like this creator is describing in her video

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.420
when we start doing that

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.720
the gap widens because we're no longer acting

00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:39.320
playing the part that men expect of us

00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:43.820
so more men begin to disrespect us

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.940
the truth

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.160
is peeled back and then we talk more

00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:54.820
we get more angry and other women see that

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.740
and then other women start noticing the gap

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.960
and then they start talking and they start acting up

00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:02.980
and they start being who they wanna be

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.140
not playing the part ascribed

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.640
and then they notice the gap

00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:09.420
because then they notice what it is

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.020
how they're treated when they're seen as a bad woman

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.400
back up then widens for them

00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:22.100
then they start talking feminist rage is contagious

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.340
feminist consciousness propels the movement

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.720
it is not an individual process

00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:29.820
it is a collective process

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.980
it's a process about solidarity with one another

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200
being a feminist is a becoming

00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.140
it is a constant becoming

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.340
it is a collective process

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.960
a constant collective process of becoming

00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:50.200
of raising consciousness in ourself and then in others

00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:52.940
so that's why I ask are you a feminist
