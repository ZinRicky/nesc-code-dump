00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.200
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:05.581
We are getting ready for our first full day in California.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.960
For this trip in March. I went to this gluten free bakery,

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.401
and it was absolutely incredible.

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:13.081
I haven't stopped thinking about it.

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:14.441
And now I used to collab with them,

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:15.781
which is so fun.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.360
After we eat breakfast, we're going to go to the pier in Santa Monica.

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:22.821
Walking up and down the pier,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.620
taking lots of film pictures.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.240
The weather here is absolutely unreal.

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:29.941
It's so beautiful.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.260
Then tonight we're actually getting dinner with Dean and Catherine.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.180
It'll be the butlers and the brawlers. Tonight.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.160
We found things in the works.

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:43.921
Tomorrow, Jake and I are going to the Warner Brothers Studio Tour.

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:46.201
So I can't decide what I should wear.

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:49.061
I could wear these cute little shorts.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.880
This white tank. Did wear a dress.

00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:54.321
This is the one that I was thinking about wearing.

00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:58.221
Very summer. Maybe I wear this dress and then change.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.300
Would be stupid to wear this dress and then change.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.500
You guys know that I'm absolutely obsessed with fears, nature.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.720
I cannot say enough good things about this rare beauty product.

00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:16.521
I think that it's one of her most underrated products.

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:19.281
I never have seen anybody talking about it.

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:21.881
Is her glossy bomb. This is the color.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.141
Nearly apricot.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.160
Stunning. And this is what the whole fit looks like.

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:28.981
I think it's so cute.
