00:00.120 --> 00:02.480
My husband was on his way out to grab a burger

00:02.481 --> 00:05.921
when I realised that we had all the ingredients at home to make one,

00:05.922 --> 00:07.441
so that's exactly what I did.

00:07.442 --> 00:10.461
I got started with my dough for my burger buns,

00:10.480 --> 00:11.520
combined some flour,

00:11.521 --> 00:12.641
water, yeast,

00:12.642 --> 00:16.321
egg and some butter and let that go until it all came together.

00:16.322 --> 00:17.921
Once it was soft and smooth,

00:17.922 --> 00:21.401
I placed it in a different bowl to rise for about two hours.

00:21.402 --> 00:22.961
Once it had doubled in size,

00:22.962 --> 00:26.921
I turned it out and cut it up in eight pieces

00:26.922 --> 00:29.161
and form those into little balls,

00:29.162 --> 00:31.521
making sure that they were all the same size.

00:31.522 --> 00:33.881
I repeated that with all of my pieces of dough

00:33.882 --> 00:35.841
and place them on my baking sheet.

00:35.842 --> 00:39.161
I then lightly press them down to flatten them out a little

00:39.162 --> 00:40.841
before covering them with a towel

00:40.842 --> 00:43.061
and letting them rise for another hour.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.160
Once they were puffy,

00:44.161 --> 00:45.881
I brush them with some melted butter

00:45.882 --> 00:50.161
and also beat up an egg with some water to brush on top of that,

00:50.162 --> 00:53.921
and then I opted to sprinkle my buns with some sesame seeds,

00:53.922 --> 00:56.081
pop those in the oven for about 15 minutes

00:56.082 --> 00:58.361
and got started on making a quick pickle.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.721
Sliced up some cucumbers and made my brine

01:00.722 --> 01:03.921
before adding some smashed garlic and peppercorn to that.

01:03.922 --> 01:06.761
I set that aside and got started on my patties,

01:06.762 --> 01:08.281
which was just some ground beef

01:08.282 --> 01:11.841
and I smashed it really thin before seasoning it with Some salt,

01:11.842 --> 01:13.901
pepper, and some seasoning. Salt.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.160
This point my buns were done,

01:15.161 --> 01:18.961
so I let them cool and moved on to slicing all of my toppings,

01:18.962 --> 01:20.481
which were some tomatoes,

01:20.482 --> 01:22.081
red onions, some lettuce,

01:22.082 --> 01:25.561
and I laid them out so that would be easier to assemble.

01:25.562 --> 01:27.761
The last step was frying my patties.

01:27.762 --> 01:31.281
So I got my pan really hot and seared it on both sides

01:31.282 --> 01:33.761
before adding some white cheddar cheese on top.

01:33.762 --> 01:34.921
And once that was melted,

01:34.922 --> 01:37.001
I assembled his burger with the patties,

01:37.002 --> 01:39.161
some tomato, the lettuce on top.

01:39.162 --> 01:41.041
He doesn't like sauce on his burger,

01:41.042 --> 01:43.601
so I put some homemade ketchup on the side.

01:43.602 --> 01:46.465
He always needs a sprinkle of flaky sea salt on that.
