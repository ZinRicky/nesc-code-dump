00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.560
You know how, like,

00:00:00.561 --> 00:00:03.281
when you're exercising, they say to take progress pictures

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:05.281
so that you can see where you started from.

00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:06.361
Like, journal,

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:09.981
do something in some way to document what you're feeling

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.700
so that you'll know, like,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.680
when the moment comes where you're thinking,

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:14.681
should I go back?

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:18.481
Should I just undo it all and just forget that this happened,

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:20.221
you can remember why you left.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.580
And when you're having a hard moment in the future,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.720
you can look back on other hard moments you had and be like,

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:25.081
well, fuck,

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:26.321
I made it through that, too.

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:27.481
You know what I mean? Like,

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:29.161
if she can do it, so can I.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.121
You know, past me,

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:31.881
did it, currently can do more.

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:33.481
I can keep going, you know?

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:34.881
And when you can't look to that,

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:35.601
you can look to the other.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:36.561
If she can do it, I can do it.

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:37.561
If she can do it, I can do it.

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:40.281
It's just a big Fucking Game,

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:43.601
Spider Man, where we fucking find our freedom and happiness.

00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:48.041
So excited for you. Truly trust the process.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:50.481
It really. Read all the comments,

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:52.481
follow all the people that,

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:53.641
you know, strike a nerve with you.

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:54.321
That feel like, okay,

00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:56.281
she's kind of feeling the vibe or she gets,

00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:59.921
you know, because you do kind of start to rebuild your whole life.

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:01.561
You're gonna rebuild friends. Like,

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:03.881
you know, shit you never thought possible will happen

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:05.561
in good ways and in bad ways.

00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:07.521
You Know, people helping you that you never thought would help you,

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:10.021
or people turning their back on you that you never thought would.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.100
Whatever the fuck. But I guarantee you,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.320
life is gonna be so much better

00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:18.761
when you actually have a say in what happens.

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:22.161
I'm so truly, so fucking excited for you.

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:25.361
And I'm sending you like, so much love and encouragement.

00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:27.252
Cause when you know, you fucking know.
