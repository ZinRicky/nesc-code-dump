00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.800
Okay, I got some serums that I fucking love.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.960
Today's the first day I used them,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.700
but I really fucking like them.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.380
This is some revital lift.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.420
I don't know what the fuck they are.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.900
The point of this is

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.880
this is their vitamin C and caffeine.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.340
I serum fucking love this.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.980
Then I got their vitamin C,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.300
E, and salicylic acid for the face to brighten.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.520
Love that. And then I got this from Trader Joe's.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.800
Hyaluronic acid.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.180
I use that next.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.560
Then just a regular moisturizer.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.480
I'm at my boyfriend's house,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.360
so this is the one I'm using.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.760
But this is not the one I use at home,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.100
but I do like this one.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.040
And then before I go to bed,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.800
I'm gonna put marula oil,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.080
a really light coating.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.840
Cause moisture,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.020
moisture, moisture.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.440
We don't wanna look like fried chicken.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.380
We wanna look like the raw chicken.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.740
And then aquaphor on top of that.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.180
That's my plan.
