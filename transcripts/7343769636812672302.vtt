00:00.080 --> 00:01.080
I had a C section,

00:01.080 --> 00:02.320
and it was wonderful.

00:02.320 --> 00:04.280
I've always heard really bad things about them.

00:04.280 --> 00:05.560
I've always heard horror stories,

00:05.560 --> 00:06.720
but I wanted to make a little video

00:06.720 --> 00:09.240
just telling my story and how absolutely amazing it was.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.400
I walked into the operating room,

00:11.400 --> 00:15.160
my doctor and all the nurses were so nice, so calming.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.800
Lay down on the table,

00:16.800 --> 00:18.440
had the spinal put in by my doctor,

00:18.440 --> 00:20.440
and then it was almost time to meet my baby.

00:20.440 --> 00:23.240
Being in the operating room was the closest to heaven

00:23.240 --> 00:24.880
I have ever felt in my entire life.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.720
They did a cool thing

00:25.720 --> 00:28.120
where they put a clear tarp in front of me

00:28.120 --> 00:30.960
so I was able to see my baby come out.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.240
And my doctor right away

00:32.240 --> 00:33.960
pushed him up to the plastic chart

00:33.960 --> 00:34.880
so I could look at him.

00:34.880 --> 00:35.720
He was crying.

00:35.720 --> 00:36.440
He was beautiful.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.440
He was perfect.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.000
Immediately went and weighed him,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.080
and my husband got to cut the cord.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.120
I was completely awake,

00:42.120 --> 00:43.920
completely coherent for the entire thing.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.440
And as soon as they were finished stitching me up,

00:45.440 --> 00:46.680
I got to hold my baby,

00:46.680 --> 00:47.600
do skin to skin,

00:47.600 --> 00:48.400
and breastfeed.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.920
I was up and walking around

00:49.920 --> 00:51.880
the whole floor of the hospital that night,

00:51.880 --> 00:53.320
and my scar healed up nicely.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.200
You can barely see it,

00:54.200 --> 00:55.680
and I can even wear a string bikini now.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.240
If I could relive that day,

00:57.240 --> 00:58.960
I would do it again and again,

00:58.960 --> 01:00.558
and I wouldn't change a thing.
