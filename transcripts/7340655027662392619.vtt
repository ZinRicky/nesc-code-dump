00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.860
men taking selfies is now an “ick”

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.108
I don't understand that, 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.881
how is men taking selfies an “ick”

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:10.900
I saw a couple videos of people explaining why they think it's an ick

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.280
but I don't agree,

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:14.601
in fact, if I like you or wanna pursue you,

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:15.721
I wanna see you.

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:17.561
I want you to share your day with me,

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:20.381
with your selfies or pictures of what you're doing.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.880
I don't think that's an ick

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:24.921
it brightens my day that you wanna share your day with me

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:28.161
the person in this video goes on to explain why they think it's an ick

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:30.521
and they think that it's because

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:34.541
it makes them look like they're too into themselves or too feminine

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:35.981
which I don't agree.

00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:37.821
don't you want a man that's confident?

00:00:37.822 --> 00:00:39.474
I don't see that as feminine. 

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:40.714
especially in the beginning,

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:42.074
like if I like you

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.994
I wanna see you and learn more about you and me

00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:47.414
send selfie of your outfit of the day,

00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:49.574
you at the gym, or what you're doing.

00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:50.889
I love that!

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.729
 it's gonna determine if I like you or if I like your style

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.889
now the second explanation that they gave

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.707
is that they think that the person is fishing for compliments/

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:03.067
or because he's insecure

00:01:03.068 --> 00:01:04.207
so that's what he wants

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:07.758
now men don't necessarily need validation

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.388
but it's so important to show interest in him or his life

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:12.468
and if you're not into it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.188
you can still acknowledge that he's interested in it

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.528
and it means something to him

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:18.537
that’s basic human decency

00:01:18.538 --> 00:01:21.497
so no, I don't think that's cringy or an ick

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:24.337
if a man that you like wants to send you a selfie

00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:26.298
or share what they're doing throughout the day

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.919
this is the age we're living in

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.859
I welcome it, like yes

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.899
send me a selfie!

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.534
share what you're doing with me!

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:34.414
I love that and I live for that!

00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:34.879
I don't know,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.899
call me crazy..

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.181
what do you guys think?
