00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
It's not single mothers raise criminals.

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:06.301
It's fathers abandoned their children

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.500
and mothers do their best with what they got going on.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.400
Can't focus on the one parent that stayed and was doing something

00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:16.241
and then talk shit about the results.

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:18.201
Why don't we talk about

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:22.461
and focus on the men that are abandoning their children,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.200
impregnating women with no intention of ever raising that baby,

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:29.001
using children as a weight and, like,

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.241
a burden to, like,

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:33.641
Mark their territory with women and, like,

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:36.041
knock them off the shelf, so to speak.

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:37.321
Like, it's disgusting.

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:39.481
It's disgusting and it's disgusting,

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:42.721
and we're not gonna let the focus get fucking muddled here.

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:47.161
It's not the fact that the children were raised by single mothers.

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:49.621
Purpose of that statistic and that study

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.520
was to point out where we could put more resources.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:55.361
And that means

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:59.921
men could actually step up and support the fucking children

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:02.540
that they created just as much as the woman.
