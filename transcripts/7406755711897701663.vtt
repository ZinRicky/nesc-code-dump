00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.960
I'm throwing a birthday party for my baby boy Austin.

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.281
He's turning 3 and so I'm making him a cake

00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:07.601
using ingredients I know and trust are good for him.

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:08.801
I got started in the morning

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:11.161
by sifting my regeneratively farmed wheat flour

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:13.681
and dry ingredients, then got started mixing my wet batter.

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.561
Eight backyard eggs thanks to Tuna,

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:18.081
Nicoletta and the others, combined with melted pastries,

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:19.321
butter, and coconut sugar.

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:22.161
Enough to sweeten the cake but not give someone a glucose spike.

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:24.161
Next I made some homemade baking powder

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.981
since the store bought varieties always have cornstarch or aluminum.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.440
And then I combined my dry ingredients into the wet batter

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:31.241
and stopped mixing right when it was combined

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:33.361
so not to over mix the batter and make it tough.

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:34.721
I'm making a triple layer cake,

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:37.721
so I used three 8 inch cake pans and buttered them liberally.

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:39.241
There's nothing like cake batter,

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:41.261
especially when it's homemade with good ingredients.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.400
Those baked for 20 minutes

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:43.161
and once they were cold

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:46.521
I did a cake wash using milk and maple syrup to add more moisture.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:47.961
Next I whipped up the icing,

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:50.761
which I have to say was the hardest part of making a healthy cake

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:52.161
because I don't use powdered sugar.

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:53.641
But after doing this so many times,

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:56.721
I have finally mastered the art of a perfect buttercream frosting

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.161
with unrefined maple sugar.

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:00.081
I use as little as I can get away with.

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:02.201
The most exciting part is assembling the cake

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:03.841
Although it's not as easy as it looks,

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:05.201
triple layer icing action.

00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:06.881
There's no skipping here. And lastly,

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:08.921
what's the cake without a theme this year?

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:10.561
Essence getting a monster truck cake.

00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:12.681
In the past I've normally done die free sprinkles,

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:14.881
but since his obsession right now is cars and trucks,

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:16.418
he's going to get just that.
