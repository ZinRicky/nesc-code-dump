Being from Germany,

00:01.480 --> 00:04.560
Thanksgiving is not something that I'm super familiar with.

00:04.561 --> 00:07.601
Over the years I've gotten a little bit more familiar with it,

00:07.602 --> 00:10.361
and since we won't be home for the holidays this year,

00:10.362 --> 00:14.121
I decided to cook us a little Thanksgiving spread ahead of time.

00:14.122 --> 00:16.321
Started by making a roasted garlic,

00:16.322 --> 00:17.961
lemon zest, compound butter,

00:17.962 --> 00:21.721
and also prepping some sweet potatoes for a sweet potato rolls.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.981
Let my yeast bloom and some warm milk,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.120
then added some honey, some eggs,

00:26.121 --> 00:28.321
our sweet potatoes, butter and flour.

00:28.322 --> 00:30.641
I let that go until it came together,

00:30.642 --> 00:32.521
and then I called lucky to knead the dough

00:32.522 --> 00:34.361
for about five to eight minutes.

00:34.362 --> 00:35.321
Once it was smooth,

00:35.322 --> 00:39.141
I let it rise for two hours while I got started on our stuffing.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.600
Since I didn't have stale bread,

00:40.601 --> 00:43.201
I roasted my bread until it was toasted.

00:43.202 --> 00:45.641
While that was cooling, I chopped up some carrot,

00:45.642 --> 00:46.981
celery, onion.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.120
I like adding some sausage to my stuffing,

00:49.121 --> 00:51.641
so today it was a chorizo pork sausage.

00:51.642 --> 00:54.801
I combined my torn up bread with with my mixture,

00:54.802 --> 00:56.201
put that in a baking dish,

00:56.202 --> 00:57.361
topped it with some parsley,

00:57.362 --> 00:59.401
and baked until it was golden brown.

00:59.402 --> 01:02.081
And then it was time to get started on our bird.

01:02.082 --> 01:03.361
Lucky does not like Turkey,

01:03.362 --> 01:05.681
so I usually opt for a roast chicken.

01:05.682 --> 01:08.161
Today it was fennel and citrus roast chicken.

01:08.162 --> 01:10.161
Put my compound butter under the skin,

01:10.162 --> 01:12.001
on top, stuff it with celery,

01:12.002 --> 01:15.041
and bake it at 3:50 for about Three hours.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.281
I also prepped some maple glazed carrots

01:17.282 --> 01:20.161
and cranberry salsa to go on top of those.

01:20.162 --> 01:22.441
This point, my dough was ready to get worked with,

01:22.442 --> 01:25.541
so I punched the air out and formed it into little rolls,

01:25.680 --> 01:27.240
put those in my baking dish,

01:27.241 --> 01:30.281
and let them poop for about 45 more minutes.

01:30.282 --> 01:33.041
In the meantime, started on my mashed potatoes.

01:33.042 --> 01:35.321
I boiled my potatoes, rice them,

01:35.322 --> 01:37.361
combine them with some heavy cream and butter,

01:37.362 --> 01:39.121
and also some roasted garlic.

01:39.122 --> 01:42.581
My favorite thing to make is this miso green bean side dish.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.120
Forgot my rolls were in the oven,

01:44.121 --> 01:46.601
so they got a little darker than I wanted to,

01:46.602 --> 01:48.201
but they were still delicious.

01:48.202 --> 01:51.601
I let my chicken rest, plated all of my side dishes,

01:51.602 --> 01:55.301
also my gravy, and this was absolutely divine.
