00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.400
I have a lot of Little House in the Prairie fans that follow me

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:04.961
because of my connection with Little House,

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:07.261
and so that is why I'm making this video.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.880
But I really need this video to gain traction

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:15.281
so people can be aware of what's going on in the Little House world,

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:18.241
because this is extremely important.

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:20.641
And so if you watch Little House on the Prairie

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:22.841
or you know somebody that watches Little House on the Prairie,

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:24.881
please send this to them or comment below,

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:29.721
because this is a very important message that needs to be talked about

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:31.561
of what's going. What's going on right now,

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.201
because it's absolutely crazy.

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:34.841
I'm gonna introduce myself very quickly.

00:00:34.842 --> 00:00:36.121
My name is Jennifer Brawler.

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:39.041
I am Dean Butler, who played Almanza Wilder.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:41.441
Almanza Wilder on Little House on the prairies.

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:45.601
Social media director. And I work very closely with him

00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:47.161
along with some of the other cast members

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:48.241
from Little House on the Prairie.

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:49.521
Especially in the last month

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:52.261
and the most recent events of what's happened.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.320
I am in the daily grind of Little House.

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:58.201
Little House is my full time job.

00:00:58.202 --> 00:01:02.401
So it all began about a month ago, uh,

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:06.521
when the Little House on the Prairie cast had separated themselves

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:10.221
from a promoter who was doing Little House on the Prairie events

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.880
all around the country. They were traveling from city to city.

00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:16.801
They were doing events for the 50th anniversary year.

00:01:16.802 --> 00:01:21.341
That's this year. And they have Been extremely busy.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.760
About a month ago, they did an event in Connecticut,

00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:26.141
in Pennsylvania, that was extremely poorly organized.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.120
Oversold tickets. People were waiting for six to seven hours,

00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.301
sometimes longer, to meet people.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.580
There was lack of food, there was a lack of ADA policies.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.240
There was a lot of issues that happened in this,

00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:43.081
and people were very hurt by it.

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:44.281
People lost a lot of money.

00:01:44.282 --> 00:01:45.921
People paid a lot of money,

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:47.161
didn't even get to meet the cast

00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:49.641
because of this organizer and the promoter

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:54.121
and the lack of organization that took place

00:01:54.122 --> 00:01:56.941
and that carried on in Pennsylvania.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.240
It was like a back to back event.

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:03.101
So after all of that, the cast of Little House on the Prairie

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.920
removed themselves from this promoter

00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:07.441
and cancelled the events for the rest of the year.

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:08.961
They had four other events scheduled.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.121
One in Miles, Tennessee,

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:12.401
one in, uh, Keystone,

00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:14.001
South Dakota, one in Branson,

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.081
Missouri, and one in Corsicana,

00:02:16.082 --> 00:02:18.761
Texas. And the cast canceled those and said,

00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:21.241
we will not ever be working with this promoter ever again

00:02:21.242 --> 00:02:23.901
because of the way that they handled these events.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.720
And this is where it gets pretty crazy.

00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:27.501
When they made the statement,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.000
when they said, hey, guys,

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:30.681
we're done. We're cancelling these events,

00:02:30.682 --> 00:02:33.281
they thought the promoter would go to eventbrite

00:02:33.282 --> 00:02:36.301
and cancel the events for the rest of the year.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.720
But this promoter did not do that.

00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:40.641
No, no, no.

00:02:40.642 --> 00:02:44.321
They put sold out on all of The things

00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:47.921
so they did not have to start issue refunds right away.

00:02:47.922 --> 00:02:49.881
So these people, these fans

00:02:49.882 --> 00:02:51.721
thought that these events were still happening

00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:53.541
when they were already cancelled.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.240
People were showing up to these events

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.641
expecting to see the cast of Little House on the Prairie,

00:02:57.642 --> 00:02:59.001
and there was nobody there.

00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:00.981
People were absolutely devastated.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.600
People lost so much money.

00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:04.241
They haven't received refunds.

00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:06.741
They're dis disputing their credit cards.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.360
It has been a massive mess.

00:03:08.361 --> 00:03:10.621
It was not until Melissa Gilbert,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.320
who played Laura Inglis Wilder,

00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:15.121
went public with this and it hit national news.

00:03:15.122 --> 00:03:18.361
People magazine came out with an article about this,

00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:22.601
all of this. And that is when the promoter finally changed the events

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.401
from sold out to cancelled.

00:03:24.402 --> 00:03:28.461
Now, while I am so glad that that is all happened,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.960
there are so many people that have been so hurt by this situation

00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:37.921
and by this promoter, and it is absolutely devastating.

00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:40.921
I'm talking about so many people

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:43.201
that are still owed thousands of dollars,

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:44.981
vendors that have not been paid.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.560
It's absolutely atrocious what has happened.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.961
Now, I say all that to say today,

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:52.801
Dean Butler, Alison Argrem,

00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:53.881
and Pamela Bob

00:03:53.882 --> 00:03:57.521
came out with an episode called the elephant in the room

00:03:57.522 --> 00:04:00.141
on the Little House 50 podcast.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.560
I, I really encourage you to go listen to it

00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:03.921
so you can hear more

00:04:03.922 --> 00:04:07.061
behind the scenes of what actually happened to the cast.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.480
Also, the fans have been affected deeply.

00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:12.201
The cast was Affected deeply.

00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:14.501
So many people have been hurt by this promoter,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.120
and I wanted to make a video for my followers

00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:18.241
so that they could be aware.

00:04:18.242 --> 00:04:20.961
To bring awareness of what's been going on

00:04:20.962 --> 00:04:23.921
and how devastating all of this is.

00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:25.361
I grew up watching Little House.

00:04:25.362 --> 00:04:26.801
I'm a massive fan of Little House,

00:04:26.802 --> 00:04:29.521
and now being able to work with such incredible people

00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:30.881
is a dream come true of mine.

00:04:30.882 --> 00:04:31.961
And it breaks my heart

00:04:31.962 --> 00:04:35.721
that so many fans have been affected by this terrible situation.

00:04:35.722 --> 00:04:39.881
I want you to know that the cast is grieving just as much as you are.

00:04:39.882 --> 00:04:44.261
They. They have been hurt deeply by the situation.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.440
And there are things going on behind the scenes,

00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:49.821
and I really hope this man is brought to justice.
