00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.920
not to be dramatic

00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:02.463
but I think I might have just had the best 

00:00:02.464 --> 00:00:03.361
weekend of my entire life

00:00:03.362 --> 00:00:04.824
and I didn't achieve anything 

00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:05.361
no cleaning

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:06.161
no renovation

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:07.241
no jobs no work

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:08.801
I was just present in the moment

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:09.661
and god it was good

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.320
I kicked off the weekend by having a one on one

00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:12.921
mini golf date with my middle child

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:13.801
my boy Malachi

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:15.761
and normally I never show my kids on TikTok okay

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:18.081
but I really wanna be able to relive this weekend over and over

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:19.470
also I think it's important for you to know 

00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:20.481
that sometimes I do other things

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.361
and I don't just spend all of my time cleaning

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:23.831
one thing that you might not know about me 

00:00:23.832 --> 00:00:24.481
is once upon a time

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.041
I used to be young and quite fun

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:26.761
one of my first jobs

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:27.921
like 16 years ago

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:29.521
was at a dance music radio station

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:31.561
and that really just fostered this love of gigs

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.586
and going out and listening to live music 

00:00:33.587 --> 00:00:34.841
and talking shit obviously

00:00:34.842 --> 00:00:35.881
and you probably already know

00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:37.201
but I became a mother at 20

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:38.921
so for a big chunk of the last 12 years

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.441
I haven't really gone out a whole lot

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:41.361
and one thing that my husband

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:43.441
and I decided when we moved back to Auckland last year

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.481
was that we wanted to spend our money on making memories

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:46.921
and sharing experiences together

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:48.630
so when my sister in law and her partner 

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:49.881
invited us to come to Synthony

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:50.441
to celebrate

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:51.001
her birthday

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:51.841
we thought hell yeah

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:52.641
that sounds great

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:54.561
our friend Clint Roberts was an amazing MC

00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:55.641
and we saw Tiki Taane

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:58.281
Fat Freddy's Drop, Synthony and Rudimental I won't lie

00:00:58.282 --> 00:00:59.902
I was a little bit overwhelmed by the sheer 

00:00:59.903 --> 00:01:01.081
number of people that were there

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:02.961
and they said that they were expecting 35,000

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.241
I didn't believe them but yep

00:01:04.242 --> 00:01:05.561
there was 35,000 there

00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:06.761
and we called it a night quite early

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:08.281
cause I didn't wanna feel tired the next day

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:09.681
this spider lives my car by the way

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:10.401
and I can't catch him

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:11.241
but I've named him Michael

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:12.681
and he quite likes drinking out of my Stanley 

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:14.306
anyway I had a special mummy daughter 

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:15.761
date day lined up with my youngest Olive

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:17.281
and I took her to Kiwi Valley Farm

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:18.281
which is in Waitakere

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:19.841
and I haven't been here for about five years

00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:21.241
so I don't know what I was expecting

00:01:21.242 --> 00:01:23.061
but it definitely exceeded my expectation

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.680
and honestly

00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:25.241
this girl was having the time of her life

00:01:25.242 --> 00:01:27.201
like she would come here every single day if I let her

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:28.361
we held the baby animals

00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:29.361
and then we went around the farm

00:01:29.362 --> 00:01:31.481
and she fed each and every single one

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:34.281
she was not gonna let one animal get away with not being fed

00:01:34.282 --> 00:01:35.401
we went on a tractor ride

00:01:35.402 --> 00:01:36.201
which was super fun

00:01:36.202 --> 00:01:37.721
they took us up to the top of the farm

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.601
and you got quite a good view looking down

00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:40.681
and there are few extra animals

00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:42.121
and horses and things for her to look at

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:43.881
and then we went and lined up for a pony ride

00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:44.401
and of course

00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:45.481
we had to do it twice

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:47.361
she had to do everything on the farm twice

00:01:47.362 --> 00:01:48.201
I'm not even joking

00:01:48.202 --> 00:01:49.081
we were here all day

00:01:49.082 --> 00:01:50.161
that was kind of the point

00:01:50.162 --> 00:01:51.321
and I had nowhere else to be

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:52.561
and I was just happy she was happy

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:55.281
by the way if you're keeping tabs on the fairness scale like I am

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.086
and you noticed that I only took two out of 

00:01:57.087 --> 00:01:58.481
three children on a date this week

00:01:58.482 --> 00:02:01.041
don't worry cause I took my eldest on a one on one date last week

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:02.809
anyway we wanted to round out the weekend 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.241
with some special time as a family

00:02:04.242 --> 00:02:06.041
and the kids suggested going off to the movies

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:07.041
and I don't know about you

00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:09.201
but I'm not a huge fan of actually going to the movies

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:11.041
and also I was thoroughly peopled-out

00:02:11.042 --> 00:02:12.081
I looked at what was showing

00:02:12.082 --> 00:02:13.801
and the only movie that we actually wanted 

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:15.121
to go see was the new Willy Wonka

00:02:15.122 --> 00:02:18.361
by the way this mess is why I normally don't do my skincare in my pjs 

00:02:18.362 --> 00:02:19.361
Anyway so I did a little googling

00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:19.961
and it turns out

00:02:19.962 --> 00:02:21.800
you can actually rent the Wonka movie from 

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:23.041
the neon app here in Aotearoa

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.761
New Zealand and we collectively decided

00:02:24.762 --> 00:02:26.761
aka I made the executive decision

00:02:26.762 --> 00:02:27.801
that getting in my jammies

00:02:27.802 --> 00:02:28.561
doing my skincare

00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:29.401
having some takeaways

00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:30.161
and watching the movie

00:02:30.162 --> 00:02:31.481
from the comfort of my own home

00:02:31.482 --> 00:02:33.121
sounded way better than going out

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:35.281
that is exactly what we ended up doing

00:02:35.282 --> 00:02:37.481
even broke the rules and let the kids eat in front of the telly

00:02:37.482 --> 00:02:38.641
which we never do

00:02:38.642 --> 00:02:39.201
but don't worry

00:02:39.202 --> 00:02:40.521
I did put a towel down

00:02:40.522 --> 00:02:41.641
and I'm bloody pleased I did

00:02:41.642 --> 00:02:43.281
because that pasta sauce was messy

00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:44.961
And because I wanted the kids to feel like they were

00:02:44.962 --> 00:02:46.481
getting a proper movie experience

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:47.561
and it was still a bit special

00:02:47.562 --> 00:02:48.681
we ordered in some treats

00:02:48.682 --> 00:02:49.481
which we never do

00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:52.031
and can I just say that the Wonka movie was fantastic
