00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.300
How are.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.380
How are my moms doing? My mom friends,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.940
the ones home with kids all summer,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.240
right, right, right.

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:13.141
I'm losing my fucking mind.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.220
I was not made for this.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.800
And then I am babysitting another child for the summer.

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:20.461
So on top of my four,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.260
I get to hear another one talk about how bored he is.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.440
At least that one doesn't talk shit to me,

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.901
cause he's not mine, but mine sure do.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.480
So I'm literally, like,

00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:36.341
snuck out in the backyard and I'm just

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.780
waiting for the next request.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.860
Um, so, yeah,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.480
I really think I get, like,

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.961
the summer blues just from this.

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:54.121
It's like, I don't know.

00:00:54.122 --> 00:00:56.281
I would love if my kids were at some camp.

00:00:56.282 --> 00:01:01.161
I would love if we had activities and vacations and shit,

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:03.541
but we don't. So we're fucking home,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.260
and that's fucking great.
