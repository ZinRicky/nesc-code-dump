00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This little thing is the secret.

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:02.361
You see,

00:00:02.362 --> 00:00:05.661
it's got this little sensor right here and this little green light.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.760
And you stand in front of it

00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:12.181
and it even the camera adjusts to your height so you can adjust it.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.480
This thing adjusts to your camera.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.481
Just little springs that you open.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:23.121
It also rotates this way and it also bends like this way.

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.421
I mean almost all, all the way around

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.180
whatever you need to do. And it's got a really sturdy little base.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.120
And then you can even take this part off

00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:33.041
and attach this to a different tripod

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:34.721
so it can be even a better height.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.881
But that just comes tabletop ready.

00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:39.201
Sometimes I like to be over here

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:43.861
and sometimes I like to hang out over here.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And if you're alone at home

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.161
and you need someone to help you film some shit

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:52.241
and you need help, so if you have like a high thing you can set it on,

00:00:52.242 --> 00:00:54.141
like, I had it on my bookcase,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.240
this thing will upgrade your content creation.

00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:59.921
Just saying. It does help you film shit when you wanna kinda like

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:01.201
walk around and move and like

00:01:01.202 --> 00:01:02.441
make it look cool and shit.

00:01:02.442 --> 00:01:04.001
