00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.240
women are not meant to work 9 to 5 jobs

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:06.881
I said this before and I'll say it again

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:09.281
we shouldn't have to work 9 to 5 jobs

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:13.561
women are meant to go to Pilates class,

00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:15.041
tan by a pool,

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:16.580
read a good book,

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:18.380
take care of the children,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.800
make good food,

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.221
and be provided for by a man

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.040
there's no way a woman can be in her feminine energy

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:28.761
if she's sitting at a 9 to 5 job where she's unhappy

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:29.801
worst part is

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:31.801
is there's women out there that are

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:35.181
having to fill that masculine role in the office

00:00:36.412 --> 00:00:38.136
because they have to be

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:39.917
they're covering bills

00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:42.197
they're paying for half a dinner,

00:00:42.198 --> 00:00:44.428
when a man should be paying for the job every time

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:46.068
when did we as a society

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:50.804
decide that women should go to a 9 to 5 job to feel some gratification

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:52.929
instead of staying at home with the kids.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.309
if a woman wants to work part time

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.209
so she can spend more time with her kids at home

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.145
she should be able to do that

00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:01.410
and don't get me wrong

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:03.091
if you wanna work a 9 to 5 job
