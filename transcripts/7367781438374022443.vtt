00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.600
You know,

00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:03.921
I'm not sure I've ever seen anyone so spectacularly miss the point.

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:07.941
You think I get dressed and do my makeup for other people?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.080
The point is to get dressed and present yourself the way that you feel

00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:15.041
beautiful. Which does not mean that you're gonna wear pajamas

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:17.241
and not wanna get dressed up.

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:19.721
It just means you're not looking for other people's approval

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:20.561
and how you do.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.201
So I dress the way I do

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:24.821
and I put on makeup because I like looking at myself,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.640
looking cute. It makes me feel confident.

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.941
It feels like a physical expression of my internal self.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.020
Women can still wear makeup and do it for themselves.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.264
Misogyny in this take is remarkably obduce.
