00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.120
I wanna talk about the history of women using male pseudonyms JK

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:10.480
Rowling and gender fluidity and where the conversation is at today

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.440
so I'm Doctor Zoe

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:17.920
I have a PhD in digital feminist activism and I talk a lot about hot

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:19.440
sticky feminist topics

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:24.640
so I've noticed recently that there is growing discourse about how JK

00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:29.780
Rowling is using gender fluidity to her own advantage

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.040
while denying others the opportunity to do the same

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:38.240
and this is so interesting to me because years and years ago

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:41.940
I brought this up when she started using Robert Galbraith

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.440
um to publish under for her crime series

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:46.700
and obviously she's always said that she used JK

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.580
so that people would know that her name was Joanne

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.560
so that she could kind of benefit from the Assumption that she was a man

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:57.460
but a few years ago people would not into that argument

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.520
pro trans people would say well

00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:02.360
it's different it's not the same

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:05.000
you can't equate transness with using male pseudonym

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.140
JK Rowling has been doing this for years since the start

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.800
and I wanna talk about why it's suddenly an accepted argument to use

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.400
when a few years ago it wasn't

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:16.320
so the reason is

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:19.960
really that society's understanding of gender expression

00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:22.980
has progressed a lot in the last five or 10 years

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.000
so this is now exposing JK

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.860
Rowling's hypocrisy in a way that it previously wasn't really widespread

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.160
understood so firstly

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:32.640
let's look at how the trans rights debate has evolved

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:33.600
so JK

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:39.940
Rowling's position on trans rights has been very fixed in gender essentialism

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.160
the idea that your gender is determined by your biology at birth

00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:45.560
and is immutable so

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:50.520
it's no longer lost on people that those who prescribe to the idea of gender

00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:54.300
like JK Rowling believe the gender is very firmly fixed

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.120
should not be

00:01:55.121 --> 00:02:02.480
then using gender fluidly in the way that they portray themselves to the world

00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:04.880
I think it's also really important to acknowledge at this point

00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:09.080
that the use of male pseudonyms by female authors is not at all a new thing

00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:13.000
we know about the Bronte sisters that wrote under the bell brothers

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:14.960
we know George Elliott did this

00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:16.880
whose name is actually Marianne Evans

00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:22.440
and this is very much lauded as a feminist thing

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:26.800
that they had to do to get by in a patriarchy

00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:28.960
they would have never gotten published otherwise

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:31.820
if you read the forwards to the Bronty sisters books

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.240
defending that they are the bell brothers

00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:38.040
it's very funny now that we know that they are the Bronty sisters

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:42.720
but I think it's well understood that this is just resistance against patriarchy

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:48.340
and is very accepted and very acceptable that women in 19th century did this

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.840
let's talk about what makes it different when JK

00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:51.400
Rowling does it

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:55.440
it's pretty clear she didn't do it to gain entry into the literary world

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.640
she was already a huge success um

00:02:57.641 --> 00:02:59.000
with Harry Potter obviously

00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:02.340
before she came out as Robert Galbraith

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.280
so she didn't really need to do it

00:03:05.281 --> 00:03:08.140
it's more something that she wanted to do

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.300
and I believe that she wanted to continue to operate with the same privileges um

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.360
that she had before and actually be able to put her work out there

00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.360
without the previous judgement of Harry Potter

00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:23.680
so it wasn't something that she did for necessity

00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:26.800
but rather something that she did um

00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:29.200
to extend her privilege um to

00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:31.820
to extend the way her books would be received

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.440
and I think that these days that comes across very inauthentic to people

00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:40.580
people find that to be yeah

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.640
not really the vibe so

00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:44.640
we have rolling a cisgender woman

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:49.740
being able to fluidly navigate between the genders as she pleases

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.240
depending on how she wants her persona to be portrayed

00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:58.560
depending on how she wants people to perceive her work and her writing

00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:01.360
meanwhile she is spreading trans hate

00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:04.240
but the next thing I wanna talk about for a little bit of a tricky thing

00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:08.240
it's about the evolution of the way that we understand gender and transness

00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:12.520
we used to very much rely on this idea of born in the wrong body um

00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:16.140
that you've got a dysphoria that needs to be changed and fixed

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.080
and I think that we are progressing beyond just that

00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:21.680
as an understanding of transness

00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:24.800
this kind of rhetoric also mirrors the gay rights movement that

00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:28.440
where we really spoke about gayness for a very long time

00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:35.980
as I was born this way and it is in my biology somehow that I am gay

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.020
and that was a really necessary

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.940
I guess way

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.660
way to talk about it to get conservative buy in um

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.700
for the gay rights movement

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.620
but I think now sexuality is understood as a lot more fluid on that

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.260
and a lot more influenced by our agency and our society

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.240
um social conditioning

00:04:59.241 --> 00:05:01.420
um what's acceptable

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.080
um as well as how you were born

00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:06.640
so let's take the concept of political lesbianism

00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:09.920
I know this is very controversial and a lot of people don't like the idea of it

00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:13.900
people are threatened by the idea that you might be able to choose

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.260
that's because we relied on the idea that you can't choose

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.600
to show that gay people should have human rights

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:22.960
so this idea was essential to the gay rights movement

00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:28.880
because it really neutralized conservative opposition to um

00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:34.340
different sexualities people like to understand something as fixed and innate

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.100
and struggle with anything else

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.600
people feel threatened by the idea that maybe sexuality is a little fluid

00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:43.280
sometimes um

00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:47.860
and a little flexible and people struggle with understanding gender the same way

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.240
but I believe we're undertaking a shift right now

00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:53.660
where people are beginning to understand gender as a lot less fixed

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.320
lot more fluid and flexible

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.980
we are moving beyond the born this way narrative

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.560
that is the logical conclusion that I don't think people have been able

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.760
to hasn't been making sense to me for a long time

00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:05.480
why people haven't been able to see that

00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.920
but to me that's the logical conclusion

00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:11.060
go back to our Queen of fantasy

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.280
JK Rowling

00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:13.680
now I wanted to use the JK

00:06:13.681 --> 00:06:16.320
Rowling example to discuss this

00:06:16.321 --> 00:06:21.560
because I think it is a great signifier for where we're at in this conversation

00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:26.500
and how it's progressed moving beyond the rigid and the fixed

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.660
and the irony of someone who uses fluid gender constructs for personal gain

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.620
and personal wealth

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:44.640
while also throwing trans people under the bus is now very obvious to everyone

00:06:44.641 --> 00:06:50.900
I think this marks a shift in our consciousness about gender

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.680
and how we're understanding it

00:06:52.681 --> 00:06:55.000
as expressive as fluid

00:06:55.001 --> 00:06:59.440
and we're rejecting the rigidity of the previous conversation

00:06:59.441 --> 00:07:03.760
