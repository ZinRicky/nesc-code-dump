00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.920
your baby knows how to breastfeed from the moment they're born

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:06.360
all babies have this innate instinct called the breast crawl

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:09.080
when babies are born their eyesight is not very strong

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:11.960
so they rely on other senses to find their way to the boob

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:15.680
babies have this innate instinct to crawl towards the nipple

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.080
using their sense of smell

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:18.620
get this the body so crazy

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.880
mother's nipples literally put out a scent that smells like amniotic fluid

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:27.600
so they're literally following descent that they know from being in Mom's womb

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.920
over this process can be totally disrupted

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:33.840
if baby was taken a NICU if babies getting a lot of procedures done

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:36.640
if baby doesn't see mom for an extended period of time

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:38.800
forgot the epidural or Pitocin

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:41.080
your baby is given a bottle or a pacifier

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:43.900
before breastfeeding relationship is fully established

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.030
you can run into issues 

00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:47.462
skin to skin contact is absolutely 

00:00:47.463 --> 00:00:49.904
essential right after birth with mom

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.200
to make sure that we can actually capitalize on this instinct

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:55.560
so our women's bodies innately flawed

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:59.700
or does nature know best and this information is hidden from us
