00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.307
I managed to keep this trip a complete secret 

00:00:02.308 --> 00:00:03.760
from the kids until last night

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:05.181
and Iâ€™ve been bursting with excitement

00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:06.080
 to tell them for months

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:08.640
because holidays like this are a rarity for our family

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.400
I was actually hoping to keep it a surprise until we got to the airport

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:12.880
but it turns out planning everything

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:14.153
packing everything and cleaning the house 

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:14.760
for the housesitters

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.200
is a dead giveaway

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:18.144
think I freaked out a few people at the airport 

00:00:18.145 --> 00:00:19.440
by carrying around this baby doll

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:20.899
maybe I shouldn't have been holding it by 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.560
one leg upside down

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:23.680
my holiday read is a court of thorns and roses

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.120
and I know I'm late to the party

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:26.120
but I was skeptical okay

00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:28.520
I thought surely it can't be as good as everybody says it is

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:28.947
but it is 

00:00:28.948 --> 00:00:30.825
it was late afternoon by the time we got to 

00:00:30.826 --> 00:00:31.680
beautiful Queenstown

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:33.240
and of course everybody was exhausted

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.720
I don't know what it is about travelling

00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:35.680
but it's tiring so

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:37.262
we just wandered around the township for a 

00:00:37.263 --> 00:00:38.440
while before finding some dinner

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:39.920
at Sherwood this place is amazing

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:41.320
they grow most of their own produce

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:42.134
brew their own booze

00:00:42.135 --> 00:00:43.520
 and everything is locally sourced

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.326
we shared the slow roast lamb and some sides 

00:00:45.327 --> 00:00:46.600
before calling it a night early

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:48.318
because tomorrow is gonna be a busy day
