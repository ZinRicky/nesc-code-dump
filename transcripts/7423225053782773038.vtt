00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.360
let's understand how we got here

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:09.960
after Roe v Wade was overturned

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:13.200
the department of health and Human Services had a sneaking suspicion

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:16.300
that red states were going to start denying emergency

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.200
life saving care to pregnant people

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:22.280
because…America. so they sent out a little PSA to states being like 

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:23.080
don't forget that you

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:27.660
federal obligations to provide emergency care to pregnant people

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.760
who are still people.

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.920
see  EMTALA is a federal law that says 

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:35.200
if you're a hospital and someone comes in with an emergency medical condition

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.360
you have to provide stabilizing treatment okay

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:38.280
so the department was like

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:38.960
hey states

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:40.160
don't forget about EMTALA

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:42.360
and here is specifically what they said

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:43.640
they said just as a reminder

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:47.000
if a physician believes that a pregnant patient comes to the ER

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.720
and is experiencing an emergency medical condition

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:52.160
and an abortion is a stabilizing treatment

00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:55.300
that is necessary to resolve the condition

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.120
the physician must provide the treatment

00:00:58.121 --> 00:00:58.960
literally just saying

00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:02.120
if somebody comes in with a medical emergency and they need an abortion

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:05.740
you have to treat them. so what do you think the state of Texas does?

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.040
it sues The Department of health and Human Services

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:13.940
just let that sink in the state of Texas sued over this

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.300
this is what they're like no

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.460
do we have to don't make us do that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.320
can't we just let her suffer

00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:22.520
and because we live in hell

00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:24.640
the district court sided with the state of Texas

00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:26.040
and basically told the department

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.160
just let the state of Texas do whatever they want

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.440
because we actually live in a place that's one step below how

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:33.640
the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's order

00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:36.200
so the Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:37.000
they were like um

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:38.160
hey you should hear this

00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:39.760
like really crazy stuff that's going on

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:41.960
and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:45.040
they were like now we feel like it's fine the way it is

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:46.400
okay so where does all that leave us

00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:48.040
so as of right now

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.240
the federal government

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:53.980
cannot require states to provide pregnant people with emergency care

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.040
States like Texas can force pregnant people to lose their organs

00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:01.800
to become brain dead to get so sick that they go into septic shock

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:06.800
and so much more all because they refuse to provide emergency

00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:10.040
life saving abortions I'm the feminist lawyer

00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:11.913
