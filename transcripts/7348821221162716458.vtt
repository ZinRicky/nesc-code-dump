00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.360
You shouldn't get married young,

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.760
because by the time you finish growing up,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.480
you're gonna want different things in life.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.600
At least that's what I've been told.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.240
And as someone who got married 18,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.500
I can attest

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.560
you will want different things in life after you finish growing up.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.960
I'm only 22, and I know my brain hasn't finished developing yet,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.600
but I can barely recognize the person that I was before I got married.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.280
I have changed in so many ways,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.960
and I've turned into a confident

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.220
young woman with very different life goals than I used to have.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.040
But this change has not been bad.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.160
It's been good.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.040
And if anything,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.060
it's brought me closer to my husband.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.800
Him being my constant

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.380
best friend throughout the last four years has been so wonderful.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520
We're closer now than we ever have been.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.540
We're more obsessed with each other than we were when we got married.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.920
Change is a good thing.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.280
You should expect. It happens no matter what age you are.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.200
Marriage will definitely change you.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.120
I love who I'm becoming.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.880
I love my husband is becoming.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.700
You shouldn't be scared of change.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.400
When you get married and you commit yourself to that person,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.700
you're making a promise,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.880
and that promise must be kept.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.180
I've never once doubted the promise that I made.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.520
And while many,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.000
many things have changed about me and around me,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I remain ever thankful that I said yes to marrying him

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.260
when I was Eighteen.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.800
I know I'm only four years in,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.080
but it's been a really wonderful four years of marriage so far.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.160
Cheers to change.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.320
Cheers to maturity.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.060
Cheers to growing up together.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.600
Marriage is not scary because you don't have to go through it alone,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.706
and that is the fun part.
