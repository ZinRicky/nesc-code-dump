00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.920
stop asking people if they forgive you when you're apologizing to them

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:06.520
because it's shitty and it's manipulative

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:10.680
and I will tell you why the purpose of an apology is not to garner forgiveness

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:12.320
it's to show accountability

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:14.820
meaning you understand that what you did was shitty

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.240
and you are recognising to yourself that it was shitty

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:20.360
and you're letting other people know that you know that it was shitty

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:22.580
that does not require someone to forgive you

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.880
and in many instances you are not deserving of forgiveness

00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:27.080
if during an apology

00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:30.500
you are asking the person you're apologizing to if they forgive you

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.240
you are now putting the responsibility

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:35.460
of absolving you of your wrongdoing onto them

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.400
which they cannot do and if they don't feel like forgiving you

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:40.260
you are making them very uncomfortable

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.560
because you can absolutely move forward with a relationship in a positive way

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:44.840
without forgiveness

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:47.980
and this is especially important when you're apologizing to your kids

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.140
because they shouldn't feel obligated to absolve you of your guilt

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.080
a great way to pose this for children when you're apologizing to your kids

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:58.420
if you've acted a fool is to finish the apology like this

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.560
hey child of mine

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:01.940
I'm sorry for doing this shitty thing

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.280
I shouldn't have done it I recognise that it's wrong and you didn't deserve that

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.000
I will try to do better in the future

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.440
because that wasn't how I wanna handle myself

00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:14.480
can we move on from here or should we have more of a conversation about this

00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:18.840
so you feel okay now you can reword that however it feels natural to you

00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:21.320
but asking a child do you forgive me

00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:24.360
is trying to put a bow around a messy situation

00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.140
and it's okay for all of us to learn to stand in our own mess
