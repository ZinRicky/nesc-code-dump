It is wild how deeply invested so many people are into

00:03.560 --> 00:05.800
the life of Hannah from Ballerina Farms.

00:05.800 --> 00:06.320
And usually

00:06.320 --> 00:06.920
when we talk about

00:06.920 --> 00:09.160
people being obsessed with a celebrity or an influencer,

00:09.160 --> 00:10.880
we talk about the kind of people that, like,

00:10.880 --> 00:11.880
want to become like them,

00:11.880 --> 00:13.800
that will buy everything that they're selling

00:13.800 --> 00:15.720
and are just obsessed in that way.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.000
But the people who are obsessed in a negative way

00:18.000 --> 00:18.920
and obsessed with, like,

00:18.920 --> 00:20.300
picking apart their lives,

00:20.320 --> 00:21.600
they are just as weird.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.520
So case in point,

00:22.520 --> 00:24.240
I've had quite a few people comment

00:24.240 --> 00:27.640
and let me know that Hannah is running a business page,

00:27.640 --> 00:28.920
like, she has employees

00:28.920 --> 00:30.940
and she is a business,

00:31.000 --> 00:32.280
and they're acting like this is,

00:32.280 --> 00:33.320
like, big news,

00:33.320 --> 00:35.080
like they didn't know this.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.300
But the rest of us are sitting over here like,

00:38.240 --> 00:40.940
yeah, and. And, like,

00:41.280 --> 00:42.120
go on. Of course

00:42.120 --> 00:43.000
it's curated.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
She's running a business.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.560
She has millions of followers.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.740
Anybody who has that many followers

00:47.760 --> 00:48.920
is running a business.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.400
And a lot of people have said things like,

00:50.400 --> 00:51.880
well, if I had that much money,

00:51.880 --> 00:52.880
I could do that, too.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.360
Or if I, you know,

00:54.360 --> 00:55.360
married this person,

00:55.360 --> 00:57.040
I would be in that situation, too.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.960
And that is called a cope.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.320
It's a way for people to make themselves feel better

01:01.320 --> 01:03.720
when they are feeling inferior to somebody else. So

01:03.720 --> 01:05.960
I have all these people trying to tell me these copes

01:05.960 --> 01:07.020
and trying to, like,

01:07.040 --> 01:08.320
make me believe them.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.040
But in My head.

01:09.040 --> 01:09.720
I'm just thinking.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.720
I think a lot of other women are thinking like,

01:11.720 --> 01:14.040
we didn't feel inferior in the first place.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.680
She could have $100 million that she's not disclosing.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.560
She could have $10 billion that she's not disclosing.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.480
She could secretly be married to Elon Musk

01:21.480 --> 01:22.760
and not tell us about it,

01:22.760 --> 01:24.720
and we still wouldn't feel inferior.

01:24.720 --> 01:25.840
Just do what the rest of us do.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.920
We follow the accounts that we think are interesting,

01:27.920 --> 01:30.120
and we don't follow the ones that aren't interesting.

01:30.120 --> 01:30.934
It's not that deep.
