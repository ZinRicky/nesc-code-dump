00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
You say the praises of god, and you recite some verses in the Quran,

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:09.101
right? Then you say Allahu Akbar again, and you go down in Ruku.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.380
This is called another position, Ruku.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.440
So where are you saying subhanallahu WA ta'ala?

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:15.161
Like, oh,

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:16.975
god is greater? Okay.
