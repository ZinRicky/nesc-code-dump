00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.120
When we were browsing the Christmas section at the store last night,

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:05.961
my toddlers freaked out when they saw candy canes

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:07.681
and begged me to get some.

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:11.021
I told them I would make them some in the morning and they agreed.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.960
Started by combining some sugar,

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:17.161
corn syrup and water and letting that heat up to 300 degrees.

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:21.121
Once it hit 300 I divided it in half to my white section.

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:24.601
I just added some mint extract and began folding it in,

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:26.481
and when it wasn't too hot to handle

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:30.021
I began stretching it out until I couldn't do it anymore.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.760
The other half of my sugar mixture

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:35.001
I added some cherry extract and some red colour

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.201
and repeated the same steps I did with the white candy.

00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:41.601
Started by folding it into each other and then stretching it out.

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:43.441
Once I couldn't stretch it anymore,

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:46.121
I began molding the two colours together,

00:00:46.122 --> 00:00:50.921
slowly twisting it around each other to make classic candy cane swirl.

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.761
Once I was satisfied with the length,

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:54.441
I cut it, twisted it,

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:56.881
and made sure to get that signature hug.

00:00:56.882 --> 00:00:57.561
At this point

00:00:57.562 --> 00:01:01.621
my kids wouldn't wait any longer and needed to try them immediately.
