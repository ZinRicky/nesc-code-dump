00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.640
This morning my mother asked me if I would do the farm chores.

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:07.161
So I got the kids out of bed bright and early and drove over.

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:10.081
The first thing to do when I get there is milk Sandy,

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:13.661
one of our 100% grass fed, pasture raised cows.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.160
My goal is to milk her by hand

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:17.721
because I like to be able to do things the traditional way.

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:20.041
It's definitely an art and I'm still a bit scared.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:21.961
So I got some help with that? Sure.

00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:24.041
Next I needed to filter the raw milk,

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:27.701
which is a quick process and removes any unwanted particles.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.680
Sandy gives us one gallon per day,

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:32.001
so we freeze the milk for future usage.

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.041
Cheese, yogurt,

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:35.001
cream cheese, Cafire cream,

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.641
butter, ice cream, etc.

00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:40.141
Our pasture raised chickens receive a 100% organic,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.640
corn free, soy free,

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.201
fermented feed. The kids collect their eggs

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:46.761
which we will use to make the family breakfast.

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:50.561
We have so many eggs in storage and we love this nutrient and staple.

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:52.521
Next the cows and all of us

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:55.081
walk over to feed the Guinea fowl their breakfast.

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:57.601
They give us upwards of 20 eggs per day.

00:00:57.602 --> 00:00:59.321
Their egg shells are so hard,

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:00.241
like a stone.

00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:03.841
We make our way over the bridge and into the vegetable garden

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:05.961
where I do some much needed harvesting.

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:08.781
Mainly summer squashes, lettuces and broccoli.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.160
Lastly, I get a fire started for breakfast

00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:13.539
while the kids have a glass of fresh raw milk.
