00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.840
I just saw a video from a mom who her narcissistic co parent

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:08.601
is not allowing her to see her oldest child on his birthday

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:09.601
it's his weekend

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:11.121
so sucks to suck

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:14.021
WAP WAP you don't get to see the kid today

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.740
and I've been there and it does hurt

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.300
and I just wanted to give you some perspective

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.360
there's you know

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:23.361
there's three pieces to this conflict that's going on

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:24.001
the other parent

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:24.841
the child and you

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:28.001
the other parent is doing this just to hurt you

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.841
there's no consideration for the child whatsoever

00:00:30.842 --> 00:00:31.481
cause obviously

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:34.961
a child is gonna want all the people they love to be present at big events

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:38.641
so this has everything to do with you and nothing to do with the child

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:41.541
whatever big Celebration or whatever the fuck he did for the kid

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.320
that is not for the kid

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:45.441
that is to try to rub shit in your face

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:47.441
the reason he's doing it is to fucking hurt you

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:48.321
to ruin your day

00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:49.081
to make you cry

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:49.921
so you know what I started to

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:52.661
to started to do instead

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.120
on my children's birthday

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.241
I celebrate me

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:56.401
if they're not with me

00:00:56.402 --> 00:00:57.601
I gave birth

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:00.021
that was a big fucking day for me too

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.160
and I'm gonna

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.981
I'm gonna have cake on my kid's birthday

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.440
I I always do this

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:07.081
if I don't have them on their birthday

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:08.281
I buy a cake

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:09.921
and I celebrate them myself

00:01:09.922 --> 00:01:12.201
I celebrate myself for having the child

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:13.361
and I celebrate my child

00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:16.221
and I make sure to save a piece of that cake when they come home

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.940
and then we have their birthday cake together

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.760
and the kids know what's going on

00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:23.761
they fully understand

00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:25.041
cause they probably ask

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:26.501
is mom gonna be here

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.480
and when dad looks him in the face and says no

00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:29.661
or whatever bullshit

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.160
they are go like

00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:33.001
you're an adult

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:34.801
you were able to look back on your childhood

00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:36.441
and shake out what was true what wasn't

00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:37.761
who was a dick who wasn't

00:01:37.762 --> 00:01:39.241
your kid is gonna do the same

00:01:39.242 --> 00:01:44.061
so don't give the ex the satisfaction of having it ruin your day

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.320
fuck you you know what

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:46.521
I gave birth today

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:47.521
and you know what

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:48.481
on that birthday

00:01:48.482 --> 00:01:52.081
I was so fucking tired and exhausted when I gave birth to my kid

00:01:52.082 --> 00:01:54.441
I'm happy to have a day to celebrate myself

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:55.721
make myself feel good

00:01:55.722 --> 00:01:57.101
and when I see my baby

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.560
they're gonna be happy to see mommy anyway

00:01:58.561 --> 00:01:59.201
we're gonna celebrate

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.161
he's not taking anything from you

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:03.021
he's being a petty little prick

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.480
and in the end

00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:05.501
you will win

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600
so in the meantime

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:09.461
just know that uh

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.540
you did the right thing

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.400
he's just trying to punish you

00:02:13.401 --> 00:02:17.301
and just don't accept that punishment I love you
