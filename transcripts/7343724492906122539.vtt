00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.720
Alright, this one is mostly for my Charleston people.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.360
So I was leaving the opening party

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.960
for Charleston Wine and Food Festival last night.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.560
It is by far my favorite time of year.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.480
We have some of the best chefs

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.480
and best food in the country

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.080
in my opinion.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.460
So food and Wine Fest is just the best.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.800
But I had an amazing lift driver

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.560
who was driving me home.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.040
He was a born and raised Charlestonian

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.220
and we were talking about

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.280
how much the city has changed and grown

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.460
and who can call themselves a local.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.160
Cause in my opinion,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.400
when I moved here 13 years ago,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.200
I was told that the only way that you could tell

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.640
anybody that you were Charleston locals

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.800
if you were born and raised here,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.600
and preferably

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.800
if your family was also born and raised here.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.600
Now don't get me wrong,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.320
I would love to be able to rock things and say like

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.400
Charleston local on them,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.840
but I am very aware of the fact

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.160
that I am still a New Yorker.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.900
I don't think that'll ever change.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.440
He was of the opinion that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.280
if you've lived here for 10 years plus,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.720
you can call yourself a local now.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.120
So I wanna hear your opinions

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.580
from people who live in Charleston,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.800
both born and raised and transplants.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.360
Do you call yourself a local?

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.480
Were you born and raised here?

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.280
And who can call themselves a local?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.460
And is all this just silly gatekeeping?

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.240
I don't know.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.800
But you won't catch me in some local shit

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.020
until I get the approval.
