00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
our first full day in Queenstown

00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:03.560
and I couldn't work out if my fit was giving 

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:04.720
Apres Ski or David Bain

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:06.760
Either way I didn't have time to fk around this morning

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:08.375
cause we are trying to fit in as much as we 

00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:09.440
possibly can while we're here

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:11.233
and the aim of the fashion game is to wear as 

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:12.520
many garments as you possibly can

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.040
cause it's like negative 3 degrees

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.160
would you believe me if I told you I was wearing 8

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:17.184
9 if you count socks 

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:18.160
last time I was here

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:21.000
the gondolas were old and rickety but now they're pretty fancy

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.800
and it took us 450 metres

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.837
or about 15 feet for my American friends 

00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:26.080
up the side of a mountain

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:27.240
and the view was breathtaking

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.600
we came up here to do the luge

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:30.840
but she was taking a mental health day or something

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.040
and after an hour of waiting

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.120
we decided just to settle for the virtual luge

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:35.040
And try come back another day

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:36.755
can anybody name an attraction that doesn't 

00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:38.400
make you exit through the gift shop though?

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:40.058
we headed back down the mountain and into 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.520
the township in search of some lunch

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.360
and part of my lunch came in liquid form

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:45.880
because I'm currently completely obsessed with mulled wine

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:48.040
Mark my words I'm gonna be trying to perfect this recipe

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:50.520
and then it was time for our second activity of the day

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:52.200
if you were following me a couple of years ago

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.640
when I went to Queenstown with my mum

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:55.400
some of these activities will look familiar

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:56.520
We came down for a couple nights

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:58.920
she was working I was tiki touring around by myself

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:00.080
and being the mum that I am

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:01.580
everything I did, all I could think was 

00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:02.480
“the kids would love that”

00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:04.640
by kids I mean the three young ones and my husband

00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:06.360
one such activity was the jet boat

00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:09.600
I just found this to be so much fun and I knew that they would enjoy it as well

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:10.960
it's a really thrilling experience

00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:13.920
as they take you up to 95 kilometres an hour over water that can be

00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:15.360
As shallow as 5 centimetres

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:17.280
It’s also a great way to see all the scenery up close

00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.800
cause they take you up both the Shotover and the Kawarau rivers

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:20.880
and when the guide goes like this

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:22.624
You’d better hold on tight cause you're about 

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:23.800
to do a full spin at high speed

00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.412
I thought Mark was brave for holding his 

00:01:25.413 --> 00:01:26.160
phone while we spun

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:27.680
because I could never and there's no way

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:29.696
you can escape this ride without leaving 

00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:30.680
wet and fkn freezing

00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:31.120
it's great 

00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:33.600
one thing about travelling with kids is a couple of activities

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:34.960
really wears them out and to be honest

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.958
I'm tired too so pizza on the floor it is
