00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
Truly, truly, truly.

00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:03.441
I think this is why a lot of kids grow up with so many issues.

00:00:03.442 --> 00:00:04.641
And they fucking hate their mom,

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:05.201
hate their dad.

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:05.761
They're just like,

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:06.941
fuck everything.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.320
And I feel like this is why the world is going to shit,

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:11.221
because so many women,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.640
they leave their marriage.

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:14.401
And instead of saying,

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:15.881
I already tried that,

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:20.801
I raised these kids thus far as a family. Mommy,

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:21.921
daddy, everybody.

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:23.381
That shit didn't work.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm not gonna try to replicate it.

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.081
I'm not gonna try to recreate the fucking wheel.

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:29.461
The shit didn't work.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.400
I'm not gonna bring more adults into their life

00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:35.361
to tell them what to do,

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:37.441
to have some say in their life

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:39.941
that god only knows if that's gonna fucking work out.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.960
Spend all those years submitting to a fucking stepfather.

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:43.801
Okay, okay.

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:44.481
And I'm like, well,

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:45.321
he said so, so,

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:46.541
you know, we gotta compromise,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.760
go through all that,

00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:49.081
and then the relationship doesn't work out.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.201
And then the kids grow up and they're like, mom,

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:53.861
I really wish it would have just been you and the other parent,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.820
not all these extra steps and this and bonus that.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.480
So the way it works is the house is big enough that all of us fit,

00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:07.841
and then there's a bunch of extra space where he's got his space.

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:10.961
So when I'm with my kids, doing what I gotta do with my kids,

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:12.421
he's doing his own thing.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.680
When we're all ready to Hang out and I'll be together.

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:17.941
We all hang out and we be together.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.000
And then when it's time for the kids to be with their dad,

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.321
they go with their dad, and it's just me and him.

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:25.161
It's a beautiful little living arrangement

00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:29.501
that doesn't force anybody into anything they're uncomfortable with.
