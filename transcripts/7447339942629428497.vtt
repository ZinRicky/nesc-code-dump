00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.440
Every year I promise myself that I'm gonna be organised for Christmas

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:05.041
before December rolls around

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:07.761
and every single year I get to about this point in the month

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.441
and I realise that I haven't even started.

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:13.241
I'm shopping for two preteen boys and a six year old girl

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:14.281
and let's be honest

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:17.081
six year old girl's gonna be happy with whatever I buy for her

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:20.521
but preteen boys however is a much more difficult age.

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:22.461
Ha ha, not just for presents.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.240
In my family

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:25.601
you wake up and there's a stocking on the foot of your bed

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:28.001
and you're allowed to open it before your parents wake up

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.841
and that is how I get a little bit of extra sleep on Christmas

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:35.041
and the perfect stocking always starts with an orange in the toe.

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:35.841
Don't ask me why

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:38.961
it's just what my parents did for me and it's what I do for my kids

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:42.161
and I like to put things in there that are interactive and fun

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.641
and will keep them occupied for a little bit longer

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:47.121
but they need to be small enough to fit in the stocking

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:48.041
and good enough quality

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:50.281
that they're not just gonna break or end up in the bin

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:51.601
but also not too expensive

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:54.421
because when you times everything by 3 kids

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.040
so with that in mind

00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:58.481
I went to the warehouse yesterday to see what I could find

00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.561
and I actually found some really great stuff

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:01.761
and before we get to that

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:04.761
This is your friendly reminder that Christmas is about presents,

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:05.601
not presents.

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:08.601
There have been many years where I've absolutely had to scrape

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:09.881
together something for Christmas

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:13.041
for my kids. They don't even remember what they got.

00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:15.401
Do you know what I mean? They remember being with you.

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:17.121
They remember sharing food with you.

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:19.241
They remember laughter and time spent.

00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:21.881
So please don't financially stress yourself this Christmas.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:25.281
Have fun and just be there for your family.

00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:27.741
With that said, this is what I found.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.580
Everyone's getting a whoopee cushion.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.400
I know it's not the world's greatest gift,

00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:32.321
but a little while ago

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:35.441
my daughter got one at a birthday party and everybody loved it

00:01:35.442 --> 00:01:37.681
and it broke and she was very sad.

00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:38.881
So they're getting one each.

00:01:38.882 --> 00:01:40.681
Everyone's getting a small Lego.

00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:42.281
Oliver is getting the Lego friends.

00:01:42.282 --> 00:01:45.081
We already have a few from this range and she really likes it

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:47.641
and it has a dolphin and I know she will enjoy that.

00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:49.761
And I got two Harry Potter Legos.

00:01:49.762 --> 00:01:53.361
I feel like everybody's gonna want Aragog cause it's sick.

00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:55.361
The flying car is pretty awesome.

00:01:55.362 --> 00:01:57.201
It also has Hedwig and scabbers

00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:00.041
and I made sure that both of these came with Harry and Ron.

00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:02.921
If you were to ask me what I'm personally most excited about

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:05.981
at the moment, I think it's these Nido squishies.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.720
They look like goody goody gumdrops.

00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:09.201
They come in a range of different colours.

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:12.941
They look like this and when you squish them,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.600
oh, My word,

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.701
they are just so satisfying.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.320
Everybody got a book.

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:20.841
This one is definitely not gonna fit in a stocking,

00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:24.121
so I might need to rethink how exactly this is gonna work.

00:02:24.122 --> 00:02:25.761
But I knew I had to get this

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:28.841
because my son has been wanting to read The Hunger Games for so long

00:02:28.842 --> 00:02:31.381
and I've never seen an illustrated version

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.680
and the illustration was just phenomenal,

00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:37.741
even for the golden limit.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.280
Apparently it's like the Davinci Code for kids

00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:42.981
and my little girl loves the Dragon Girl series.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.920
I thought a little game for everybody

00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:47.161
in their stockings would be a really good idea.

00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:50.241
I thought for my oldest son I would do UNO Shono mercy.

00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:53.201
He's probably the most competitive player out of all of us

00:02:53.202 --> 00:02:56.161
and apparently this one's like the cutthroat version of UNO.

00:02:56.162 --> 00:02:57.161
For my middle child,

00:02:57.162 --> 00:03:00.921
I thought that this Super Mario matching game would be cool

00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:04.181
and I got a squishmallows Trumps game for olive.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.200
No idea how to play, but she loves squishmallows.

00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:08.721
So everybody in my house loves to draw.

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:11.841
I think it's a great activity and they always go through sketchbooks.

00:03:11.842 --> 00:03:15.141
Whoa! But I feel like finding a good sketchbook can be kind of tricky.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.200
These are A4 plain sketchbooks,

00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:22.401
really nice card stock, like quite thick paper, $5.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:25.001
My boys are super into anime and manga,

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:26.781
manga drawing styles.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.340
So these are some fine line pens that I picked up for them

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.360
and the little girl, a little Bit more playful,

00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:36.921
some calligraphy pens I thought I'd get everyone a T-shirt as well

00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:38.441
cause they take up a good amount of space

00:03:38.442 --> 00:03:40.121
and they're actually not that expensive

00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:42.161
this cute little number $5

00:03:42.162 --> 00:03:43.921
my eldest is about to turn 13

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:46.481
and he is at a very difficult age to buy for

00:03:46.482 --> 00:03:49.841
because he knows what he likes and he knows what's not cool

00:03:49.842 --> 00:03:51.821
and I don't know what's cool.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.760
Apparently we don't wear things like Minecraft and Pokemon anymore

00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:57.721
we wear cool things so I'm really hoping he likes this.

00:03:57.722 --> 00:03:58.961
I thought it was super cool.

00:03:58.962 --> 00:04:00.441
We saw one like this recently

00:04:00.442 --> 00:04:03.801
which was hideously expensive and I found this for $10

00:04:03.802 --> 00:04:05.681
and my other son is 10

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:08.801
and he still very much likes wearing gaming things

00:04:08.802 --> 00:04:12.201
so Sonic the Hedgehog I got some popping elves

00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:14.561
which I will just check a few of these in the stocking.

00:04:14.562 --> 00:04:15.801
We had a Bop it,

00:04:15.802 --> 00:04:20.181
we had an R2D2 Bop it and it was great and so fun and so competitive

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.400
but it broke and so I was trying to find something similar

00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:25.721
I could only find two

00:04:25.722 --> 00:04:28.001
I don't know what I'm gonna do about the third one

00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:30.641
just a classic bop it and Simon says

00:04:30.642 --> 00:04:33.941
I also picked up these little interactive pets

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.440
and I was thinking for olive and for my niece and nephew

00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:39.241
that these would be really cute

00:04:39.242 --> 00:04:41.121
she loves taking care of things.

00:04:41.122 --> 00:04:45.221
Do you know what I mean? So that's a little ducky Turtle and a lizard.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.180
Another little cheap and cheerful gift that I saw were these Crayola

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.740
scribble scrubbies. Inside the pack is a pet

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.200
and there's all these different kinds that you can choose from

00:04:56.201 --> 00:05:00.161
and a couple of pins and you can colour in the pit and decorate it.

00:05:00.162 --> 00:05:01.241
And then when you're ready

00:05:01.242 --> 00:05:04.441
you can clean it and then just do it again and again.

00:05:04.442 --> 00:05:06.241
For my six year old, I was like,

00:05:06.242 --> 00:05:08.321
she will love this. Like I said,

00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:11.041
she will love anything for Goldie because of course

00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:12.561
we can't forget the fur babies.

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.521
She's got a tube of tennis balls

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.441
and I'll probably get her a rope toy as well

00:05:16.442 --> 00:05:18.641
and maybe something from the butcher to chew on

00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:21.561
because that is all that Goldie needs to be happy.

00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:23.801
But it is Christmas for the pets as well.

00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:27.781
Wrapping paper. I bought this whole pack because I like the gingham.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.240
It was six bucks for three.

00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:31.561
So $2 each, absolute bargain.

00:05:31.562 --> 00:05:34.361
And gold gingham because I just thought that that was so cute.

00:05:34.362 --> 00:05:37.201
And I checked the docket and I paid $9 for two of them.

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:38.801
So they must be 4:50 each.

00:05:38.802 --> 00:05:39.921
I'm such a mum because

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:42.281
the final thing that I got when I was there

00:05:42.282 --> 00:05:44.301
was two new laundry baskets

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.880
because I don't know if you've ever seen my laundry basket.

00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:48.561
They're pretty old and pretty beat up

00:05:48.562 --> 00:05:50.641
and one of them has a massive crack in them.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.961
So I got two new laundry Baskets,

00:05:52.962 --> 00:05:55.601
$15 each and they are sturdy.

00:05:55.602 --> 00:05:58.421
Like that is some thick plastic.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.840
Now I feel like I can relax

00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:02.221
because I actually have a start on Christmas.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.280
Everything that you've just seen came from the warehouse.

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.581
They've got great deals on everyday dog races.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.320
I had so much fun shopping there yesterday

00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:10.121
and I was very impressed by the range.

00:06:10.122 --> 00:06:11.861
They had heaps of things in there.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.800
And I've taken a few photos of other things that I wanna come back for.

00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:17.241
But now I better go hide this quickly

00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:20.894
before somebody walks in and spoils Christmas. Love you.
