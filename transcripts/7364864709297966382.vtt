I loved this toothbrush so much for myself.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.900
I got one for my boyfriend too.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.100
I love it. This.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.620
I like his better actually, because it's a little bit bigger.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.560
But look, it has all the different settings. It's for. You can whiten,

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.861
clean, soft polish or gum care.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.920
Can you hear it?

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:23.201
It's just this like, little sonic brush.

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:25.321
And it cleans your teeth so good.

00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:27.361
I was with a really shitty partner for a really long time.

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:29.161
He used to make me feel really self conscious about my teeth.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:29.841
He would be like,

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.841
oh my god, could you stop talking? Cause your fucking breath.

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:34.401
But it was just his fucking manipulation to get me to shut up.

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:36.081
So I've always been really paranoid about my teeth.

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:36.961
But this fucking.

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.461
These toothbrushes right here.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.700
This toothbrush.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.920
This toothbrush,

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:44.801
I love it. Very worth it.

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:47.641
ADA accepted. And it comes with enough.

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:50.581
Enough replacement heads for two years.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.049
Highly recommend.
