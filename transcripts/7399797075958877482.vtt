00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.540
The audacity.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.820
Women are done teaching men how to participate in adult relationships.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.880
And that is extremely evident

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:12.281
based on what's been going on in the dating world.

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:16.161
Because now, when women are treated badly or not considered

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:17.721
or treated with disrespect,

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.481
we no longer look internally and say,

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:21.161
oh, maybe it's me,

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:22.921
I can fix him. No,

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.661
we realize there's something deficient in this man.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.880
Because a good partner,

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.881
a good man doesn't have to be taught these things.

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:31.481
And I've been in relationships before

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:35.161
where I've had to beg men to show up in the way that I wanted them to,

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:37.581
and they will not hear you.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.520
It doesn't matter how much you try to teach a man like this

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.921
how to be respectful, how to be considerate,

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:45.601
how to show up, how to have empathy,

00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:47.561
how to actually like your partner,

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:51.001
they will not do it. Women shouldn't have to settle for partners

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:54.621
that they have to baby their way into being an adult.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.180
Women don't wanna be your moms.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.620
Women are done participating in relationships

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.500
where they have to do 100% of the emotional labor.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.160
It's no longer desirable for women to do that.

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:06.221
And they don't really have to anymore.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.840
Not like they really did before.

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.521
But honestly, the world convinced them

00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:12.061
that men should be expected to do the bare minimum,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.800
and we should be grateful for it.

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.181
Not anymore, bro.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.920
Like, do the personal work yourself.

00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:19.101
Go to therapy, read some books.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.360
Because Men who know how to do these things are out there.

00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:24.781
I didn't have to teach my husband how to be a good husband.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.780
Women don't have the energy for that shit.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.609
We have bigger battles right now.
