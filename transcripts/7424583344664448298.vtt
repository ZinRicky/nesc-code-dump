00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.680
Hi. I'm a traditional wife,

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:06.361
and I wanted to discuss today what exactly is a traditional wife? One,

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:07.961
because there's a lot of misconceptions about it,

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:09.521
but there's also people who want to gatekeep

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:11.581
and be the arbiters of what is traditional,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.360
and I just. Dumb.

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:16.281
Traditional wife is somebody who has a traditional marriage.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.761
And what do I mean by traditional marriage?

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:20.681
I mean that their marriage operates within traditional gender roles,

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:23.021
where the husband is the main provider,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.600
he is the main breadwinner,

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:26.441
and he oversees the household,

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:28.321
and the wife is the homemaker.

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:31.581
The help me that comes under her husband's authority in leadership

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.200
and submit to him when they disagree.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.801
The reasoning why you would be traditional

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:36.961
can be different across the board.

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.081
I'm traditional because I believe in scripture,

00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:40.521
and I believe in biblical values.

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:42.041
Other people may have traditional marriages

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:42.961
where they don't believe in god,

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:45.081
they don't believe in the Bible, etc,

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:46.161
but have, quote, unquote,

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:49.361
traditional marriages. It does not look the same across the board.

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:52.041
You don't have to make things from scratch to be a traditional wife.

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:54.601
You don't have to make everybody's clothes,

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:55.481
you don't have to guard them,

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:56.841
you don't have to homestead, okay?

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:58.841
It's not. It's not a monolith.

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:00.121
You are submitting to your husband.

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:01.921
That does not mean you were dumbing yourself down.

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:03.121
And you don't have your own opinions,

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:04.321
and you don't have your own values,

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:05.641
and you just do whatever your husband says.

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:08.381
I Know, people portray that as being traditional,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680
but god gave you a brain. God gave you a brain.

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:13.561
Use it. While I love baking,

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:14.721
I love being in my kitchen.

00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:16.321
I love the aprons, I love the dresses.

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:19.641
I love the general aesthetic of being a traditional wife.

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:21.401
That's not everyone's picture.

00:01:21.402 --> 00:01:24.841
The very broad term that people like to put into boxes,

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:26.983
and it's not a boxed thing.
