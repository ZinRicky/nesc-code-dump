00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.040
love is not blind

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:04.481
does anyone actually believe that it is

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:05.441
genuinely curious

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:08.561
because I genuinely believe love is not blind

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:11.921
and that TV show Love Is Blind only proves my point

00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:13.501
it's just not okay

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.920
men are initially driven by looks visually

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:20.161
and they stay for personality or intelligence

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:21.961
typically it's about looks for men okay

00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:23.081
they don't know you

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:26.021
they don't know your personality or if you're funny

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.080
all they care about is if you look good

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:32.120
like understanding personality and character to them

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.001
it's beyond them initially okay

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.081
they don't care about that

00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:36.141
they care about looks

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.160
that's why this show is

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:39.441
love is blind is so hilarious to me

00:00:39.442 --> 00:00:40.921
and they're all like oh

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:42.441
I'm looking for love

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.021
I don't care about looks

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
and then they see their partner or who they fell in love with

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:48.681
and they're all shocked

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:49.721
no brainer there

00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:51.861
love is not blind okay

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.720
you fall for someone or you're interested in them for their looks at first,

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:58.801
and then you fall in love with their personality and character

00:00:58.802 --> 00:01:00.601
y'all have second thoughts after

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.481
and okay some do end up working

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:04.460
but I'm just saying for majority

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.420
love is not blind

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.120
mmm mmm but come on

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.957
you can't tell me love is blind no
