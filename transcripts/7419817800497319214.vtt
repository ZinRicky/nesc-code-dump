For some reason, 23 feels like a very big birthday to me.

00:04.041 --> 00:07.081
I can't quite put my finger on exactly what it is.

00:07.082 --> 00:10.761
It feels like I've lived multiple lives over the last five years.

00:10.762 --> 00:13.001
I'm turning 18 to getting married,

00:13.002 --> 00:14.981
having my first kid at 19.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.360
Now, two kids later,

00:16.361 --> 00:20.361
I'm turning 23. Feels like I finally found some footing

00:20.362 --> 00:22.521
and found stuff I'm passionate about,

00:22.522 --> 00:24.601
which I never really thought I would.

00:24.602 --> 00:25.881
So much life has happened,

00:25.882 --> 00:29.161
and I'm so grateful for every single year that passes.

00:29.162 --> 00:31.561
We're currently on a little work trip in Paris.

00:31.562 --> 00:33.481
So in between all the work stuff,

00:33.482 --> 00:38.101
we're trying to find pockets of time dedicated to my birthday.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.640
First thing on the agenda was Lucky's fitting

00:40.641 --> 00:43.941
for this business of fashion gala that we're going to.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.780
Tried on a bunch of options.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.320
Whole team made sure that he got exactly what he wanted.

00:49.321 --> 00:51.041
And after he landed on his suit,

00:51.042 --> 00:54.441
we walked around Paris. Just one of my favorite things to do

00:54.442 --> 00:57.841
before we headed back to our hotel to grab some lunch.

00:57.842 --> 00:59.561
Not a huge fan of hotel food,

00:59.562 --> 01:01.821
but this was actually really good.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.680
Even though this pavlova was good,

01:03.681 --> 01:06.521
I wanna get back home and back in my kitchen.

01:06.522 --> 01:09.685
And my morning, I got a massage and got back into bed.
