00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
So I'm child free by choice.

00:01.721 --> 00:03.681
And everyone always says like,

00:03.682 --> 00:05.521
what's your purpose? If you don't have kids,

00:05.522 --> 00:06.701
what's your purpose?

00:07.240 --> 00:09.820
My purpose is getting my nails done,

00:09.880 --> 00:11.080
um, going shopping,

00:11.081 --> 00:11.801
treating myself.

00:11.802 --> 00:14.021
Look at this new bag I just got from Goyard.

00:14.680 --> 00:15.960
Stunning. Um,

00:15.961 --> 00:17.941
this new sweatsuit I got from ALO.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.600
And being sober,

00:19.601 --> 00:20.401
traveling,

00:20.920 --> 00:22.320
I don't know, taking naps.

00:22.321 --> 00:23.521
Have you ever taken a nap?

00:23.522 --> 00:24.881
It's like the funniest thing ever.

00:24.882 --> 00:27.621
It's so nice. I enjoy naps a lot.

00:27.800 --> 00:31.060
So don't say I don't have purpose just cause I don't have kids.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.720
How dare you! Okay,

00:32.721 --> 00:34.441
by all means, if you don't wanna have children,

00:34.442 --> 00:35.721
please don't have them.

00:35.722 --> 00:37.081
Your life still has purpose.

00:37.082 --> 00:37.921
It still has meaning.

00:37.922 --> 00:38.961
Of course, of course.

00:38.962 --> 00:40.001
But I will say that

00:40.002 --> 00:42.041
I do think a lot of people misunderstand

00:42.042 --> 00:43.601
what parenthood is really like.

00:43.602 --> 00:47.481
All of the phases of raising young children are so short lived.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.281
The sleepless nights with newborns,

00:49.282 --> 00:52.321
the trying to potty train toddlers, having to wake up early.

00:52.322 --> 00:53.841
All those things, like,

00:53.842 --> 00:58.641
they go by so quickly because your children grow up like that.

00:58.642 --> 00:59.881
And that's something I always heard,

00:59.882 --> 01:02.441
but I never truly understood how fast it goes

01:02.442 --> 01:04.001
until I became a mom myself.

01:04.002 --> 01:05.161
And when you stop and do the math,

01:05.162 --> 01:08.981
you realize that most parents will spend most of their

01:09.200 --> 01:11.160
parenthood as parents of adult children.

01:11.161 --> 01:12.721
Like, their kids are gonna be grown up

01:12.722 --> 01:14.761
by the time I'm in my mid to late 30s.

01:14.762 --> 01:16.241
My kids are going to be teenagers.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.081
And so even if for whatever reason,

01:18.082 --> 01:19.701
like, it was impossible,

01:19.800 --> 01:22.160
impossible for me to ever get my nails done

01:22.161 --> 01:24.881
or to ever travel to any place ever,

01:24.882 --> 01:29.001
we have literal decades worth of time to take naps

01:29.002 --> 01:32.761
and to do all of the crazy traveling we wanna do and,

01:32.762 --> 01:33.641
you know, like,

01:33.642 --> 01:34.441
just lay around.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.121
We can do that.

01:35.122 --> 01:37.441
If you go ask anybody over the age of 60,

01:37.442 --> 01:38.281
65, like,

01:38.282 --> 01:41.201
do you. Do you have any chances to nap ever?

01:41.202 --> 01:42.401
Do you have any time to, like,

01:42.402 --> 01:44.641
be alone? They're gonna tell you, yes.

01:44.642 --> 01:45.121
They're gonna tell you

01:45.122 --> 01:47.721
they probably have too much time to do those things.

01:47.722 --> 01:50.121
But what a lot of older people miss is youth

01:50.122 --> 01:52.721
and is young people and children

01:52.722 --> 01:54.841
and being around families and that kind of thing.

01:54.842 --> 01:58.521
That is what a lot of people who are older wish they had more of.
