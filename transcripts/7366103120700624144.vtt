00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.700
Can guys please just chill in regards to women?

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.660
Uh, with the aggression,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.820
with the way they speak to other guys about women

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.780
and the way they would speak to women in general,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.920
not one to usually speak about

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:17.281
the political and economic state of the world right now,

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:23.261
but a lot of girls are feeling very uncomfortable right now

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.520
and I think it's uh, my job as a guy to call out to other guys

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:30.701
and I don't think that happens enough

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.420
and that needs to start happening.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.720
So when your mates being uncomfortable at the cookout,

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:41.601
at the kick ons, when a friend is messaging in the group chat

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:44.981
telling about the girl they got with on the weekend,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.540
just have a little bit of decorum.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.840
You see enough guys acting like neanderthals in front of girls

00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:55.461
when there's people around.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.900
Imagine what's happening behind closed doors.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.240
Can we just chill out, stop being so barbaric and realise we are larger,

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:07.421
we are louder, we can be scary.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.520
So act like that in front of your mates.

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:12.461
But when this girl involved,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.420
just realise how you're coming across

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.120
and let's just make things a little bit more pleasant for everyone.

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:20.221
Thank you.
