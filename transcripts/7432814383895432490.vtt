00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.560
let's braid my hair together while I tell you why I love braids so much

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:05.680
okay to start off

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:08.320
you can see I have bangs that are growing out

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:09.560
they're almost chin length

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:11.300
and when they are chin length

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.040
I'm going to cut them back to my forehead

00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:20.620
but very light so for some reason my bangs got super thick over time

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.760
and my plan is to cut them back

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:30.100
but only like half of the hair so that I have some nice face layers

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.680
and then very wispy bangs

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:35.220
second I have a lot of sensory issues

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.780
I cannot handle it when my hair feels like it's being pulled for most of my life

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
ponytails pigtails buns

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:48.340
claw clips they just do not feel good and also give me a headache

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.200
so that's another reason

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:55.220
why I don't do most hairstyles that pull my hair back from my face

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.500
two braids is the hairstyle I have done for probably the past decade

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.100
that has kept my hair out of my face

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.700
and not pulled it weirdly

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.760
but also braids are just

00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:10.660
they fit my aesthetic well

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.620
they work really well for head covers

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.040
but really the main reasons why I prefer braids

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:20.200
is because they keep the hair out of my face

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:23.900
without pulling it and bothering me

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.180
I really haven't found another hairstyle that is as convenient

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.080
as you can see it's super quick and easy to do

00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:35.920
I face a lot of criticism for wearing braids

00:01:35.921 --> 00:01:36.880
people think that I'm like

00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:39.800
trying to make myself look younger or vantalize myself

00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:44.760
but the truth is I don't think that hairstyles should have an age

00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:47.800
I think we should be able to wear whatever hairstyles we want to wear

00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:50.040
at whatever age get used to it

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:53.020
because I'm going to be 60 with gray hair

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.939
red hair and long braids
