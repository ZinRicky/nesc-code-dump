00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.800
Let's make some homemade kombucha.

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.921
I started falling in love with kombucha a few years ago

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:09.721
and quickly realized that the cost of kombucha in stores is very high.

00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:12.401
So I figured out how to make it on my own.

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.061
And I'm so glad that I did,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.120
because now is become a seasonal favorite in our household.

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.721
If you're unfamiliar with kombucha,

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:20.581
it is simply fermented tea.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.840
I love it so much because it tastes great.

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:25.801
It usually has quite a bit of carbonation.

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:29.741
It has a lot of pre and probiotics that helps with digestion.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.920
And it has natural caffeine in it because of the black tea.

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:35.021
10 out of ten.
