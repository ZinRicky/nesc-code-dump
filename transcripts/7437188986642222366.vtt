00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.880
If you are a mother raising your daughters to be subservient to men,

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:06.561
you are the shittiest kind of mother on the planet.

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:08.581
And you don't deserve those children.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.960
Your little girls should grow up having people who believe in them

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:16.861
for more than their baby making abilities.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.400
You know in your fucking heart that you had different dreams,

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:24.041
that you had different fucking ideas of the world.

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:26.321
And somebody shove that shit down your throat.

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:30.641
And you know how fucking miserable it is to be subservient to some man

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:32.561
who makes you feel like shit every day?

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:34.041
Makes you feel like you're never enough.

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:35.201
You're never doing good enough.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.161
You're never pretty enough,

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:37.641
skinny enough, talented enough.

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:39.701
Your food is never tasty enough.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.320
Nothing you do is good enough to satisfy that man.

00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:46.721
And you're gonna raise your fucking daughter

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:48.881
to do the same fucking thing?

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:53.441
Shame on you! The definition of misery loves company.

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:56.601
The fucking fucking definition of it.

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:59.681
It's disgusting! Shame on you,

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:02.721
shame on your husband. Shame on everything you fucking believe in.

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:05.261
And I hope your daughters desert you someday.
