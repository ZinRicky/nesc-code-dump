00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.120
currently yes

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:02.241
they can however

00:00:02.242 --> 00:00:06.361
I think the debate that we're having is about the um

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:09.801
ethics of being able to share all of your views online

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:11.721
and the possible consequences of that

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:15.041
now I'm going to agree wholeheartedly with people defending this creator

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:17.801
saying that she is self aware and she wants to do the work to change

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:21.561
and she acknowledges that hating children is not acceptable

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:22.961
and she should fix that

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:25.881
my issue and my opinion again

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:29.401
it's just an opinion and especially coming as somebody who is a parent

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:33.141
my opinion is that there are a lot of people who are going to benefit

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.120
from following her healing journey

00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:39.301
and doing likewise amounts of self reflection and therapy

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.920
however the internet is a large

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:44.401
anonymous and uncontrollable space

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:47.161
so when you say things like I hate kids

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:49.681
it's from trauma and I'm working through it

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:53.521
there is going to be a percentage of people who that content reaches

00:00:53.522 --> 00:00:56.121
who stops at the I hate kids

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.321
and this is why

00:00:57.322 --> 00:00:58.561
portion of her message

00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:02.761
and will never go through the required self reflection and therapy

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.541
to fix that problem

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:07.400
they will simply feel validated and vindicated

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:10.681
and justified in knowing that there is a reason why they feel this way

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:12.761
and of course there's a reason why they feel this way

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:14.721
and of course it is linked to trauma

00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:17.641
and I do think that there is a potential for this type of content

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:18.881
or this type of messaging

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:20.041
to help those people

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:21.841
my issue um

00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:24.401
is that the potential harm that it could also cause

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:28.761
two children as a protected and vulnerable class of people

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:30.441
there is no other group of people

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:32.041
that someone would come on the internet and say

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:33.541
I hate these people

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.060
but it's because of my own personal traumas and experiences

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.420
and have that be a well received message

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.000
accept if it's children

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.941
that's what I'm trying to discuss

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.760
I think as a society

00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:49.641
there is a sphere of acceptability of things for reason

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.141
in order to protect the collective community

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.120
and my priority

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.601
as a member of a community

00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:57.521
is to protect the most vulnerable person in a situation

00:01:57.522 --> 00:01:59.241
and in this case it is children

00:01:59.242 --> 00:02:01.081
I think talking through your hate

00:02:01.082 --> 00:02:03.761
I think deconstructing it is um

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:07.321
valuable and I think it is absolutely something people should do

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:09.621
when they recognize those feelings within themselves

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.700
however because of the anonymity and vast open space and unchecked

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.760
you don't get to choose who sees your message and how they take it

00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:20.321
I think that there is a debate to be had

00:02:20.322 --> 00:02:22.741
about the potential harm that it could also cause

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.040
not instead of

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:25.061
but also

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.560
and because that harm affects people that I deeply feel protective about

00:02:29.561 --> 00:02:32.447
I'm going to draw attention to that
