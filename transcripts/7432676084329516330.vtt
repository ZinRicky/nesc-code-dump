00:00.080 --> 00:01.880
if you're not prioritizing your partner

00:01.881 --> 00:04.120
how do you think that's impacting the relationship

00:04.121 --> 00:07.920
how do you think that's impacting the way they engage/behave with you?

00:07.921 --> 00:10.040
it's important to make sure your partner knows

00:10.041 --> 00:11.960
that they are priority in your life.

00:11.961 --> 00:17.600
It's so easy to let other things in life consume us groceries/shopping/chores

00:17.601 --> 00:18.920
kids/work

00:18.921 --> 00:20.480
a job that you're unhappy at

00:20.481 --> 00:22.760
While all those things are important

00:22.761 --> 00:26.320
You should never let those things take priority over your partner.

00:26.321 --> 00:28.720
Never neglect to spend time energy

00:28.721 --> 00:31.320
and be intentional with prioritizing them.

00:31.321 --> 00:34.366
How would you feel if your partner stopped prioritizing you?
