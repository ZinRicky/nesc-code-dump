00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
We are low income. We are not wealthy by any means,

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.241
and yet I am still able to be home full time.

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:06.641
Now, it hasn't always been like that.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.720
I watched kids the first couple years of our marriage in our own home.

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:12.481
So I understand when people actually say they can't make it work.

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:13.281
That being said,

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:16.601
I do believe more people could stay home than they think they can.

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.481
America is overrun by consumerism.

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:19.721
You have to have the next.

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:22.761
But if people truly evaluated their finances,

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:24.841
cut back on the extra luxuries in life,

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:26.401
I swear, more people would be able to stay home.

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:28.721
I get it. People don't wanna give up their vacation times.

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:30.481
They don't wanna give up all the fun things

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:31.441
they get to do with their lives

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:34.241
when you have more money. But it's really about priority over privilege.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.961
I'm prioritizing our home because that is what is important to me.

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.521
I am prioritizing being with my child full time

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.801
because that is what is very important to me.

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.201
As the saying goes, if there's a will,

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:43.681
there's a way.

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:47.092
And we make the sacrifices necessary to make this lifestyle possible.
