00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
Alright, Jacob,

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:04.181
show everybody the final product.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.080
Lucky. There.

00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:07.581
There it is. She's a beaut.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.600
It is a beaut.

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:13.241
Now we'll have to do the taste test to see if it lives up.

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:15.401
Do not recommend if you're lactose intolerant,

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:17.781
because there's two and a half pounds of cheese in there.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.660
Wow.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.120
10 out of 10. Is it the best Mac and cheese you've ever had?

00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:27.561
The best. Seriously?

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:28.361
No, cap,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.900
you believe there's a. There's a Dijon mustard in there.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.700
Really interesting. Oh,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.488
I can taste a little bit now that you said that. Right.
