00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.860
On October 1st, four new agreements came into force in child welfare,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.780
customary care, kinship care,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.940
voluntary and family agreements.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.980
These are agreements that families can enter into with child welfare

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.380
and they are done collectively

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.400
with parents input on where the children should go.

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:31.901
This is a means of keeping children with their families

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.180
in their communities and in their nations.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.400
This is just one of the things that we're doing

00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:39.821
to decolonize child welfare.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.500
These agreements are important because, one,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.660
parents don't lose their parental rights over their children.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.000
And 2,

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:53.461
where traditionally families are not given the financial resources,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.580
families are now entitled to financial resources

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.900
to help care for the children in their family.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.820
So why are these agreements important?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.640
And why do they have to be in care

00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:07.441
when they have perfectly good family,

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:11.481
extended family at home? My understanding of customary and kinship care

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:13.321
is something that we've always done.

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:16.481
I come from a very large family from blood vein.

00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:19.901
My grandmother and grandfather had 23 children,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.200
residential schools,

00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:29.701
my aunts or uncles that may have fallen into that social difficulties.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.760
Then my grandparents stepped in and raised my cousins.

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:35.761
But it was normal. It was normal.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:40.661
There was no child welfare agencies that interfered.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.500
It was how we were raised.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.300
We take care of one another.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.100
We're moving away from the colonization aspect.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.720
We're going to be able to see

00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:50.581
the fact that we're able to help families

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.460
support the original bio families

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.980
that Are in need. The grandmothers would love it.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.960
They're taking care a lot of their grandchildren,

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:04.481
great grandchildren, and doing it without financial support.

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:08.201
So this will help us be able to put in beds,

00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:12.101
put in clothing, put in groceries,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.860
and even get the, the kids to do social activities,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.760
cultural activities. It just opens up a whole gamut,

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:23.321
whereas before, there wasn't support like that.

00:02:23.322 --> 00:02:25.961
This changes everything. First of all,

00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:29.421
I wouldn't have had my frontal rights taken away.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.120
I had to go to court. First of all,

00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:35.481
it started out as a voluntary placement agreement. My,

00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:38.641
I was in depression and I didn't have treatment for depression.

00:02:38.642 --> 00:02:40.821
And then they had these rules of

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.520
a voluntary placement agreement was for 6 months.

00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:47.561
But if your children have been in care for two,

00:02:47.562 --> 00:02:52.061
two years, then they automatically became permanent works.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.780
It enables us to have input to our own children.
