00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.960
Yes, this is the point, though.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.280
Feminism got women in the door

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.000
of being able to go to work,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.860
but the structure around the working day

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.560
or the workplace never shifted to accommodate

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.840
women entering the workforce,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.940
which is why we still have such,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.200
like, horrifically short maternity leave,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.720
why we have very few protections for pregnant women,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.880
why we don't have, like,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.360
child care in major offices.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.940
Like, the fact that workplaces are so unaccommodating

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.517
still means that we have a lot of work to do.
