00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
First of all, man,

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.141
who says that I am a house slave?

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.800
I mean, I'm not even home most of the time.

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:10.321
I'm out having a coffee with a friend

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:15.321
or I'm out at the gym or I'm doing something that I like to do.

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:17.441
I can go shopping. I can do whatever I want,

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:22.641
whenever I want. Just because I'm a traditional wife and mum

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:26.161
doesn't mean that I stay home and slave around all day.

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.281
And even if I was a house slave,

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:33.241
I think that I would much rather be a slave to my husband and my kids

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.841
than a slave to my boss

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:39.041
who doesn't care about me and could replace me tomorrow.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:42.021
Being a mum, being a wife, irreplaceable.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.640
I mean, sure,

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:45.321
my husband could go and get married again,

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:48.541
but it will never be to the mother of his kids.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.000
And is this truly what we've come to in this day and age

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:56.781
where your entire worth is based on your job?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.460
Everything that I do in our home is considered a job.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.160
My husband does his part and I do my part.

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:08.801
Just because he's the one out physically bringing the money in

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:12.961
doesn't mean that I'm not also earning a paycheck in my own way.

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:14.881
I'm not hiding behind my job.

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:17.521
I don't have to go out there and be a boss, babe,

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:20.461
because I know what I bring to the table.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.600
And I hate to say it and be controversial,

00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:27.241
but Most men don't actually want a boss babe.

00:01:27.242 --> 00:01:29.401
That's outdated. I mean,

00:01:29.402 --> 00:01:32.561
men want someone that's soft and feminine.

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:34.641
I can say if I was a man,

00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:38.821
I would personally like to come home to what my husband comes home to.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.020
Comes home to the kids bathed,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.200
fed, a clean home,

00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:47.081
a nice dinner. I'd rather have that as a man

00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:51.081
than come home at same time as my wife comes home from work

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:52.981
to a probably messy house,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.520
chaos everywhere.

00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:58.441
I spend one hour with my kids before they go to sleep and that's it.

00:01:58.442 --> 00:02:01.361
That is not the true definition of life.

00:02:01.362 --> 00:02:03.681
I mean, everyone has their own opinions,

00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:05.481
but this is just what works for us.

00:02:05.482 --> 00:02:08.861
And I'm not sure if people have heard of divorce.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.200
Um, if he was to leave me,

00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:13.881
I would have half and he would have half.

00:02:13.882 --> 00:02:18.641
So I think I'd be okay. I also had a career before I met him.

00:02:18.642 --> 00:02:22.441
I was not a child bride. I wasn't forced into this marriage.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.281
It's something that I chose to do.

00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:26.141
And I think that's true power

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.820
is being able to choose what you want to do with your life.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.800
Most women don't work because they want to.

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:35.101
Most women work because they have to.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.040
So that's just my opinion.

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:37.641
But, you know,

00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:39.481
you can do it that what you please.
