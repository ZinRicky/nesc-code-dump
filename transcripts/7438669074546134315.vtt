So I live in Arizona where it is hot,

00:02.401 --> 00:04.241
or at least warm most of the year,

00:04.242 --> 00:08.321
so my fall winter clothing wardrobe is very very small.

00:08.322 --> 00:09.681
So I ordered some stuff from Shein

00:09.682 --> 00:11.521
because they're having their Black Friday sale.

00:11.522 --> 00:13.001
So here are some of the things I ordered.

00:13.002 --> 00:14.321
I thought that they would be cute

00:14.322 --> 00:16.521
like date night outfits. Um,

00:16.522 --> 00:20.321
I love the idea of like long sleeve dresses that are short with boots.

00:20.322 --> 00:22.481
I think that's so cute! It's comfy.

00:22.482 --> 00:24.161
Maybe if it's cold enough here.

00:24.162 --> 00:27.401
If I get lucky enough I will wear tights under them too.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.701
I will do like a try on haul too.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.040
I'm hoping they get here soon

00:31.041 --> 00:32.961
and I'm really excited to get to dress cozy

00:32.962 --> 00:34.521
for at least a couple months.

00:34.522 --> 00:36.241
Let me know if any of you have ordered these things

00:36.242 --> 00:37.802
and if you like them!
