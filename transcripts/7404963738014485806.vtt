My husband doesn't cook, but I've been missing Germany so much lately

00:04.201 --> 00:05.441
that tonight he asked me

00:05.442 --> 00:08.561
whether I could show him one of my favourite German dishes to cook

00:08.562 --> 00:10.241
so he could cook it for me.

00:10.242 --> 00:12.721
So tonight we made some red braised cabbage,

00:12.722 --> 00:15.841
also known as horde cod and Yugoslav.

00:15.842 --> 00:17.681
We started by dicing some onions,

00:17.682 --> 00:20.401
shredding some cabbage, combining that with water,

00:20.402 --> 00:22.241
apple cider vinegar, sugar,

00:22.242 --> 00:23.881
salt and red currant jelly.

00:23.882 --> 00:26.081
I let that go for about an hour and a half

00:26.082 --> 00:28.641
while we got started on our mushroom sauce.

00:28.642 --> 00:30.161
I sliced up some mushrooms

00:30.162 --> 00:34.161
and then lucky went ahead and started sauteing some shallots

00:34.162 --> 00:36.721
and some butter. Once our shallots were soft,

00:36.722 --> 00:39.181
he added in all of our sliced mushrooms.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.680
Once those were cooked down,

00:40.681 --> 00:42.201
we added in some beef stock,

00:42.202 --> 00:45.801
some heavy cream and thickened our sauce with a cornstarch slurry.

00:45.802 --> 00:49.841
We let that simmer away and started pounding out pork loins.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.601
I like making my schnitzel with either pork or veal,

00:52.602 --> 00:56.281
but today it was pork. Once all of our cutlets were pounded out,

00:56.282 --> 00:58.921
we set up our breading station with some eggs,

00:58.922 --> 01:01.681
bread crumbs and some flour that we seasoned.

01:01.682 --> 01:03.901
And then it was time to bread our pork

01:03.960 --> 01:07.080
dipped in the flour, first the eggs and then the bread crumbs,

01:07.081 --> 01:09.201
and then fried it until golden brown

01:09.202 --> 01:12.401
before sprinkling it with some salt while it was still warm,

01:12.402 --> 01:15.101
and then we could plate. We put down the cabbage,

01:15.120 --> 01:17.400
the schnitzel, our mushroom, Sauce.

01:17.401 --> 01:19.401
This was so nostalgic to me.

01:19.402 --> 01:22.101
And obviously lucky did clean up after.
