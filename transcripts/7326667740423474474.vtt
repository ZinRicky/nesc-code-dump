00:00.120 --> 00:01.040
Hi everybody.

00:01.040 --> 00:03.540
Today I will be answering the question,

00:03.760 --> 00:05.640
why do trad wives,

00:05.640 --> 00:06.640
traditional wives,

00:06.640 --> 00:10.980
use the term trad wife instead of housewife homemaker?

00:11.080 --> 00:12.300
Why that term

00:12.520 --> 00:14.140
and what is the difference?

00:14.360 --> 00:15.680
I wanna make a disclaimer.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.020
This is my take on this video.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.560
This is what I have gathered

00:19.560 --> 00:23.380
from other traditional wives as well as myself included.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.320
But there are other traditional wives

00:25.320 --> 00:27.360
who have also done videos like this.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.160
I will tag them in the caption or the comments,

00:30.160 --> 00:32.240
so feel free to go check out their videos.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.320
They are lovely.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.280
Traditional wives here,

00:34.280 --> 00:35.580
online as well.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.220
The media will tell you traditional wives are.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.660
That is false.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.140
And now we're gonna get into this video.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.600
So to preface this,

00:44.600 --> 00:46.760
let's go over what a traditional wife is,

00:46.760 --> 00:49.100
or just a more basic understanding.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.440
A traditional wife is a woman, a wife

00:51.440 --> 00:54.740
who adheres to traditional gender roles in her marriage.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.080
Wife, homemaker,

00:56.080 --> 00:57.380
husband, provider.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.920
So now that you know that,

00:58.920 --> 01:02.040
let's go into some of the more in depth

01:02.040 --> 01:04.580
reasons why we use traditional wife.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.320
I want to add that other women in this circle,

01:07.320 --> 01:08.360
along with myself,

01:08.360 --> 01:10.600
we do interchange the words tradwife,

01:10.600 --> 01:12.120
housewife and homemaker.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.860
There are some differences,

01:13.920 --> 01:16.100
but we've all used these terms.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.600
One of the differences with traditional wives

01:18.600 --> 01:21.080
is our priorities and our values.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.320
Traditional wives are all over the world.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.720
They come from all sorts of different backgrounds,

01:25.720 --> 01:27.380
faiths, ethnicities.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.040
But today I will be talking about Christian

01:30.040 --> 01:31.120
traditional Wives.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.600
Christian traditional wives

01:32.600 --> 01:34.360
believe in biblical submission,

01:34.360 --> 01:36.200
so this is a topic that you will see

01:36.200 --> 01:38.460
often in the traditional wive community.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.480
That is why we talk about submitting to our husbands.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.580
And this does not mean

01:43.600 --> 01:45.820
the wife is of less value than the husband.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.240
But our husbands do have the most authority

01:48.240 --> 01:49.520
in our marriages.

01:49.520 --> 01:52.280
So going back to the difference between housewife,

01:52.280 --> 01:53.980
homemaker, trad wife,

01:54.120 --> 01:56.940
you can have a wife who stays home,

01:57.280 --> 01:59.520
adheres to traditional gender roles,

01:59.520 --> 02:02.220
but she might not believe in submitting to her husband.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.200
But Christian traditional wives do believe in this.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.680
On to the next point.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.400
It is not uncommon for traditional wives

02:09.400 --> 02:11.700
to supplement their husband's income.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.640
The Proverbs 31 woman was very enterprising.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.160
Therefore, it is not uncommon to see traditional wise

02:17.160 --> 02:18.660
sell things online,

02:19.200 --> 02:22.740
such as ebook cookbooks, aprons,

02:22.880 --> 02:24.640
handmade baby clothes,

02:24.640 --> 02:26.560
handmade skincare.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.960
Some traditional wives will watch children, be mothers,

02:29.960 --> 02:31.940
helpers, doulas,

02:32.280 --> 02:33.540
dog walkers.

02:33.600 --> 02:37.060
The keyword here is supplement the husband's income.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.520
And not all traditional wives

02:38.520 --> 02:40.720
need to make a little extra money.

02:40.720 --> 02:41.880
But this is also

02:41.880 --> 02:45.060
what makes being a traditional wife so realistic.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.000
Supplementing your husband's income

02:47.000 --> 02:49.180
is usually just a little extra money.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.360
It's not going to be enough to obviously

02:52.360 --> 02:53.580
live off of,

02:53.720 --> 02:54.800
but it can help.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.840
And it could be the difference between

02:56.840 --> 02:58.640
getting generic produce

02:58.640 --> 03:01.180
or organic produce for your family.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.300
It could be the difference between

03:04.200 --> 03:06.620
putting nicer clothes on your children

03:06.680 --> 03:08.240
and getting your hair done,

03:08.240 --> 03:09.080
or Your nails done,

03:09.080 --> 03:10.960
if that is something that is important to you

03:10.960 --> 03:12.140
and makes you happy.

03:12.360 --> 03:17.460
But our priority is at the home and with our family.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.200
So while we may supplement our husband's income,

03:21.200 --> 03:24.820
it does not come before our home, our family.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.700
That is our number one priority.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.480
The husband's number one priority

03:28.480 --> 03:31.040
is to protect and provide for his family.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.380
The traditional wife's priority is her home, her family.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.160
But of course,

03:35.160 --> 03:38.160
if she wants a secondary source of income,

03:38.160 --> 03:39.440
a little extra spending money,

03:39.440 --> 03:40.840
she can totally do that.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.880
So that is the difference between a

03:42.880 --> 03:44.480
maybe modern housewife

03:44.480 --> 03:46.180
and a traditional housewife.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.320
As a traditional wife

03:47.320 --> 03:48.920
making a little extra money,

03:48.920 --> 03:51.420
it might also be a seasonal thing for you,

03:51.520 --> 03:54.480
because the commitment is not always the same as

03:54.480 --> 03:56.840
maybe a full time job,

03:56.840 --> 03:57.800
if that makes sense.

03:57.800 --> 03:58.560
So when people are

03:58.560 --> 04:01.300
commenting on different traditional lives pages saying,

04:01.400 --> 04:02.320
aren't you making money?

04:02.320 --> 04:03.400
Or this and that,

04:03.400 --> 04:04.960
we aren't offended.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.000
To make money,

04:06.000 --> 04:07.980
it's okay to bless your family.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.320
Our priority is at home and our family.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.280
But there's nothing wrong with a woman

04:12.280 --> 04:13.720
making a little extra money.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.960
And it is very traditional for a wife to do that

04:15.960 --> 04:17.160
if she wants to.

04:17.160 --> 04:20.140
Traditional wives believe in budgeting and frugality.

04:20.280 --> 04:22.500
Our priority is our lifestyle.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.800
So if we have to sacrifice certain materialistic things,

04:25.800 --> 04:26.840
we will do that

04:26.840 --> 04:29.000
because we want to continue living this way.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.720
And if we have to have less things,

04:31.720 --> 04:32.680
In our life

04:32.680 --> 04:33.840
we will do that.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.220
Traditional wives love thrifting.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.160
Our clothes might be second hand,

04:38.160 --> 04:41.580
our homes might be filled with used goodies,

04:41.720 --> 04:42.480
but that is okay

04:42.480 --> 04:44.200
because we love a deal.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.200
Traditional wives love dressing nice

04:46.200 --> 04:47.960
even while at home

04:47.960 --> 04:50.280
because we spend most of our time at home

04:50.280 --> 04:51.160
for some of us.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.240
And we enjoy celebrating

04:53.240 --> 04:54.080
being wives

04:54.080 --> 04:55.800
and putting our best foot forward

04:55.800 --> 04:57.300
every single day.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.760
We know our husbands love coming home

04:59.760 --> 05:01.440
to a put together wife,

05:01.440 --> 05:04.640
so we do enjoy dressing up for our husbands.

05:04.640 --> 05:05.760
So as you can see,

05:05.760 --> 05:06.920
being a traditional wife

05:06.920 --> 05:08.680
is a lot about your values

05:08.680 --> 05:10.980
and your priorities as a wife.
