00:00.000 --> 00:01.880
Here's everything I eat in a day.

00:01.881 --> 00:03.441
Four months postpartum now.

00:03.442 --> 00:05.161
As someone that loves to cook,

00:05.162 --> 00:08.161
I always start my day off with a hot cup of tea.

00:08.162 --> 00:10.161
Today it was some rooibos tea with milk.

00:10.162 --> 00:11.921
I also hate the taste of water,

00:11.922 --> 00:14.561
so I've been putting this hydration powder in my drink

00:14.562 --> 00:17.161
and also taking my vitamins every morning.

00:17.162 --> 00:18.881
This morning we're going for sweet,

00:18.882 --> 00:22.161
so I decided to make a quick raspberry crumble,

00:22.162 --> 00:23.241
and while that was baking,

00:23.242 --> 00:26.021
I moved on to making a vanilla whipped cream.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.800
This was one of my favourite breakfast I've made in a while,

00:28.801 --> 00:31.441
and I ended up finishing the entire baking tray.

00:31.442 --> 00:33.361
You guys know I need a midday beverage,

00:33.362 --> 00:36.241
so I made a cherry vanilla iced tea today,

00:36.242 --> 00:40.401
which was so divine. Had a bunch of Sun Gold tomatoes in the fridge,

00:40.402 --> 00:43.161
so obviously we were gonna make some pasta.

00:43.162 --> 00:45.121
I started by making my pasta dough,

00:45.122 --> 00:46.361
and while that was resting,

00:46.362 --> 00:48.841
I sliced up some shallots, garlic,

00:48.842 --> 00:49.841
let those soften,

00:49.842 --> 00:53.361
and then moved on to splitting all of my Sun Gold tomatoes.

00:53.362 --> 00:54.641
Since those were cooked down,

00:54.642 --> 00:58.081
I blended them up, started on rolling out my pasta.

00:58.082 --> 01:00.281
We decided on some spaghetti today,

01:00.282 --> 01:01.401
and once those were cooked,

01:01.402 --> 01:03.001
I combined them with the sauce,

01:03.002 --> 01:07.121
some butter, and kept adding pasta water until that all came together.

01:07.122 --> 01:09.921
Made a little side salad with some arugula Blanche,

01:09.922 --> 01:11.601
broccoli, Calabrian chili,

01:11.602 --> 01:13.761
bread crumbs and a simple lemon vinaigrette.

01:13.762 --> 01:16.721
I topped my pasta With a bunch of Parmesan cheese.

01:16.722 --> 01:20.081
And that was lunch. We ended up having quite a late dinner,

01:20.082 --> 01:22.161
and I wasn't in the mood to cook a bunch,

01:22.162 --> 01:23.921
so kept it very simple.

01:23.922 --> 01:26.881
And we made some caper chimichurri chicken wings,

01:26.882 --> 01:29.781
and I also decided on a tangy slaw.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.600
This dinner is going on my weekly rotation now,

01:32.601 --> 01:33.881
since it was so good.

01:33.882 --> 01:36.601
And I always have to finish off my day with something sweet,

01:36.602 --> 01:39.941
so I had some caramel ice cream that I made the other day.
