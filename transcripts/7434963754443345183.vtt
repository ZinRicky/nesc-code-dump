00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.000
I hear you, I understand.

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.521
And I super see the validity in that

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:05.801
and I support you in that.

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.841
And yeah,

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:09.521
I get it. I super get it. That's.

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:11.921
I'm not. I don't think it's wrong to do that.

00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:12.721
I just.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.760
That's why I just wanted to make it clear why I'm not doing that.

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.441
But I super understand people who do say,

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:20.281
that's just too much for me personally.

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:21.601
For me, it's not too much.

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.761
Cause I know I needed those people to still be in my life

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.081
and I wouldn't be here without them.

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:28.801
So I feel like it's my job to be one of those people.

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:30.581
Like, that is my role.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.580
So

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.614
love all, you know. My love to you.
