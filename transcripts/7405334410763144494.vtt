00:00.040 --> 00:03.120
When I asked my toddlers what they wanted for breakfast this morning,

00:03.121 --> 00:04.321
they went back and forth

00:04.322 --> 00:08.321
and ultimately decided on blueberry bagels with some cream cheese.

00:08.322 --> 00:10.681
So that's exactly what I made them this morning.

00:10.682 --> 00:14.261
I cooked down some fresh blueberries while I got started on my dough.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.120
Added in my cooked down blueberries,

00:16.121 --> 00:17.521
some vanilla, some salt,

00:17.522 --> 00:20.521
and let that go until the dough came together.

00:20.522 --> 00:21.521
Once it came together,

00:21.522 --> 00:25.081
I needed it for another 10 minutes and then placed it in my bowl,

00:25.082 --> 00:28.201
covered that, and let that rise for about two hours,

00:28.202 --> 00:29.761
or until it's doubled in size

00:29.762 --> 00:32.401
while I got started on making my cream cheese.

00:32.402 --> 00:35.401
I decided to go for a cinnamon honey cream cheese.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.681
So I heated up my milk, let that curdle,

00:37.682 --> 00:41.761
drained it, and then placed it in my food processor until it was smooth

00:41.762 --> 00:43.401
before adding in some vanilla,

00:43.402 --> 00:45.601
honey and cinnamon. Once it came together,

00:45.602 --> 00:48.941
I popped that in the fridge while I got started on my bagels.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.000
Punch down the dough to release all the air,

00:51.001 --> 00:52.801
and then cut it into eight pieces

00:52.802 --> 00:55.541
before forming those into little balls.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.320
I repeated that with all my dough,

00:57.321 --> 00:58.521
and once that was done,

00:58.522 --> 01:02.241
I started forming them into the classic bagel shape.

01:02.242 --> 01:04.401
I made sure to make the holes a little bigger

01:04.402 --> 01:06.601
since they were gonna shrink once they boiled.

01:06.602 --> 01:08.601
I then placed them in some boiling water

01:08.602 --> 01:10.441
that also had some honey in it,

01:10.442 --> 01:13.201
left them in there for About 30 seconds on each side

01:13.202 --> 01:15.901
before transferring them over to a wire rack.

01:15.920 --> 01:16.920
Preheated my oven

01:16.921 --> 01:20.681
and then placed my bagels inside to bake for about 25 minutes

01:20.682 --> 01:22.321
before they were all done.

01:22.322 --> 01:23.641
Would usually let them cool,

01:23.642 --> 01:25.681
but the kids wouldn't wait any longer.

01:25.682 --> 01:28.681
Cut the bagels open, spread the cream cheese on top,

01:28.682 --> 01:29.979
and breakfast was served.
