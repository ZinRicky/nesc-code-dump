00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's the story of how I threw my life away.

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:02.641
Just kidding. But

00:00:02.642 --> 00:00:04.521
I know that's probably what a lot of people who know me in real life

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:06.121
thought, and probably do still think.

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:08.361
I was a speech pathology and audiology major,

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.541
and that's just fancy terms for speech therapy

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.240
and also the hearing sciences.

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.041
And while I initially really enjoyed what I was doing,

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:15.841
I started to really not like what I was doing.

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:16.761
Anyone's familiar with the field,

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:18.161
they know it's a very high stress field,

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:19.861
and the major itself is very competitive,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.040
very stressful,

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.081
because you're fighting for positions to get into grad school,

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:23.761
essentially. Anyways,

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:26.321
it was very taxing on me mentally and physically.

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:27.601
I was having panic attacks daily.

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:29.681
I was in therapy like, it was bad.

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:30.961
Then met my husband, and he.

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:33.281
When we were talking about what we wanted our future to look like,

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:35.321
he told me that he wanted me to be a stay at home mom.

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:37.321
And at the time, I absolutely rejected that idea,

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:38.721
because I was very feministically.

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:41.041
The funny thing with god is when you say no,

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:42.001
never, he goes,

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:42.521
oh, really?

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:45.881
Because my heart changed so radically for wanting to be in the home.

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:47.521
That was mainly based off of scripture,

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:48.481
because what is scripture?

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.041
Prioritize for women, the home.

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:53.201
While maybe I could go back and be a SLP assistant,

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:54.401
but I really don't want to.

00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:56.681
I have absolutely no desire to be in the workforce.

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:59.041
Because I choose to prioritize my home.

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.881
And Lord willing, when my kids are fully grown and gone,

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:04.081
I will have some grandbabies to help them raise.

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:05.257
So my work's never done.
