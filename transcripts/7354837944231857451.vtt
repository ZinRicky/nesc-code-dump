00:00.080 --> 00:03.720
Husband hasn't had a sausage Egg Mcmuffin in a very long time.

00:03.721 --> 00:05.201
When he mentioned it the other day,

00:05.202 --> 00:07.841
I knew I had to make it for him for breakfast today.

00:07.842 --> 00:10.481
So I got started on making my English muffins,

00:10.482 --> 00:12.001
combining some flour and salt

00:12.002 --> 00:14.641
and then adding some eggs to my yeast mixture.

00:14.642 --> 00:16.161
While my Kitchenaid was going,

00:16.162 --> 00:17.741
I poured in some butter.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.120
After about eight minutes,

00:19.121 --> 00:22.641
I transferred it over to a different bowl so it could rise.

00:22.642 --> 00:24.281
Next up, we're making the sausage,

00:24.282 --> 00:26.821
so I combine some pork and ground beef.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.200
I added all of my seasonings,

00:28.201 --> 00:29.721
which were some fennel seeds,

00:29.722 --> 00:30.841
Calabrian chili,

00:30.842 --> 00:31.681
and other things,

00:31.682 --> 00:35.281
before sprinkling it with some parsley and let that sit in the fridge.

00:35.282 --> 00:37.881
Got started on making some spicy ketchup.

00:37.882 --> 00:40.321
Combined all of my ingredients in a saucepan

00:40.322 --> 00:43.521
and let that simmer on low for about 20 ish minutes.

00:43.522 --> 00:44.841
Once it got thick,

00:44.842 --> 00:47.981
adjusted my seasoning and then let that cool as well.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.080
By this time, I checked on my dough and it had doubled in size,

00:51.081 --> 00:54.361
so I transferred it over to a floured work surface

00:54.362 --> 00:55.561
and just pressed it down.

00:55.562 --> 00:58.841
Then use little cookie cutter molds to get them in circles.

00:58.842 --> 01:02.641
I made some bigger and some smaller just to see what I preferred.

01:02.642 --> 01:04.641
So I cooked off my bigger ones first.

01:04.642 --> 01:06.441
Once they were golden brown on one side,

01:06.442 --> 01:09.281
I flipped them over, and once everything was done cooking,

01:09.282 --> 01:11.881
I transferred it over to my wooden plate.

01:11.882 --> 01:14.201
I formed my sausage into little patties

01:14.202 --> 01:16.961
and dried them off until they were nice and crisp

01:16.962 --> 01:18.941
before moving on to my egg.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.840
Look, he's very specific with his eggs,

01:20.841 --> 01:22.081
so he took over,

01:22.082 --> 01:23.681
did it the way that he wanted to,

01:23.682 --> 01:26.121
and then we assembled down some white cheddar,

01:26.122 --> 01:27.321
the breakfast sausage,

01:27.322 --> 01:28.641
egg, micro greens,

01:28.642 --> 01:29.801
and there we go.

01:29.802 --> 01:32.201
Look, he added some of the spicy ketchup with it.

01:32.202 --> 01:33.841
Obviously need a runny yolk.

01:33.842 --> 01:35.121
He had five more after this,

01:35.122 --> 01:37.131
so I'm assuming he really enjoyed them.
