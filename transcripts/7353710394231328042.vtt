00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.680
Minute. Tell everybody else they should be seeking partnership to.

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:04.801
That's the flip side of what this creator was talking about.

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:06.481
So go back and watch the original video.

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:07.641
It's a stitch of a stitch,

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.361
but it's about this whole four beef movement,

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:10.681
which, if you've never heard it,

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:14.681
is a movement of women who are basically not participating in dating.

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:18.121
They are not participating with men anymore until men kind of like,

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.381
get their stuff together,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.260
fix these little flippies.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.160
this reminded me of another creators video I saw a little while back

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.581
and it was like women who are in happy marriages,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.760
if something happened to your husband,

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.421
would you get married again?

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.460
Overwhelmingly,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.080
all of us say no.

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:38.481
Because there is an unspoken understanding amongst us

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:39.721
women who are married to men

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:42.121
who are very happily married and have like

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:43.321
wonderful partners,

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:44.821
that we are the exception,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.040
not the rule. Like, I'm not dating men ever again, hopefully.

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:52.401
And knock on, you know something?

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:56.581
Thankfully I don't have to cause I found one and he's great.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.880
But this also goes into the conversation of people who like.

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:01.701
Because marriage is such a societal standard,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.760
people will tell you that it's awful,

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.141
but it's supposed to be awful.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.000
No, like, you in fact don't have to do that.

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.561
I would rather, if something ever happened to my husband,

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:15.261
which god forbid, because he's my person,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.740
um, I would rather be single for the rest of my life.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.860
Or date women.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.740
Than ever be in a bad relationship with a man ever again.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.500
And I know lightning can strike twice. I know.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.420
I'm just skeptical.
