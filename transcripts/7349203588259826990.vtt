00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.400
so depending on which side of the internet you sit on

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:03.680
you were gonna see one or the other

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:07.880
parents hating on child free people or child free people hating on parents

00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:08.680
and in my opinion

00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:10.440
anybody who has to be that negative

00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:14.320
or dismissive or insulting to people who make different choices

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:16.220
have their own shit to unpack

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.340
but devil's advocate

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.280
people who choose to be child free

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:22.280
so not people who end up there by circumstance

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:25.360
people who make that choice are going against the cultural norm

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:28.080
and whenever you make any choice that goes against the cultural norm

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:29.620
you are gonna get backlash

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.240
and a lot more backlash than you're ever gonna get in person

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.240
for making the traditional choice

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:36.520
over time that can make somebody bitter and angry

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:38.820
it doesn't excuse being an asshole

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.640
but as we know

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.760
people on the internet love being a little bit brave

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:43.080
and a little bit extra assholely

00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:45.560
over here I'm gonna go ahead and make another video

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.400
talking about this whole selfish argument

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.960
because everyone who either has kids or doesn't have kids

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:54.280
is called selfish for their choice by the angry on the opposite side

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.480
and I think it's time that we kind of all collectively dissect that

00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:00.380
so we can move forward with this conversation

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.960
so that'll be the next video I post

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:02.910
right after this one
