00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.680
I only cook with non toxic cast iron or stainless steel.

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:05.361
And cast iron doesn't have to be expensive,

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:06.961
there's some really cheap versions out there.

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.401
This one is a little bit nicer.

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:10.521
It has a machine polished surface

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:13.041
so it's got a super smooth cooking surface,

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.141
kinda like how the vintage ones used to be.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.640
Now before you go putting food in any cast iron,

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:20.281
you wanna make sure it's oiled up and at a nice hot temperature

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:23.681
so food doesn't stick. Cooking with cast iron is super easy.

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:26.161
There's just a few little rules you need to follow with cook

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:27.541
while cooking and cleaning.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.080
This was the very first time I used this cast iron pan

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:33.141
and even with the factory seasoning it was ready to cook.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.620
Grab yourself some cast iron pans and get cooking!
