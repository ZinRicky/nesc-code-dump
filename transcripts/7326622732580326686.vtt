00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.140
Yesterday someone asked me,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.720
what do you say to people who are uncomfortable

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.620
with women who abort because of a detected disability?

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.300
So what? Why does that matter?

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.900
What are we going to do with that?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.620
The question reinforces this idea

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.720
that there are good girl and bad girl abortions.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.960
That of the thousands of reasons a woman may

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.840
decide to terminate her pregnancy,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.980
some are more legitimate or better than others.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.320
And this type of misogynistic reasoning

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.300
produces nothing but suffering.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.520
Right now, we have some abortion bans

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.000
that have exceptions for good girl abortions.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.880
Like abortions

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.420
if the woman's been assaulted.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.220
What does that even mean?

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.500
Is it enough to be verbally coerced?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.700
Does there need to be physical violence?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.760
How do you plan on proving that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.860
in a system that doesn't believe women?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.880
But at a fundamental level,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.760
what does it mean to be great? Arguably,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.420
it means to be impregnated without your consent. Right,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.360
but if that's the definition,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.580
aren't abortion bans just societal and cultural? Grape?

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.400
Another good girl abortion

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.000
is when her life is in danger. Newsflash,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.580
pregnancy is always a danger to your life and health.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.160
Does she have to be hemorrhaging

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.960
or at risk of septic shock?

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.920
Do they have to try surgery first?

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.900
What if your life is at risk because you're suicidal?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.840
Don't worry,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.120
Republicans have actually answered that question.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.820
They have inscribed into law that it doesn't count

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.880
under this exception

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.900
if the woman is going to kill herself.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.640
As Jessica Valenci explained last week

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.680
in front of the Senate,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920
Republicans did this because they know

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.720
that forcing women to be pregnant

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.040
will make them want to kill themselves,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.980
and they don't care.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.480
Not to mention

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.000
there's rarely one reason women need an abortion.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.840
So what if she needs an abortion because she's broke,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.880
depressed, was coerced,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.920
and the test suggests certain disabilities?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.500
Is that okay with you now?

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.480
Demonizing bad girl abortions promotes abortion bans,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.040
which we know does nothing but cause suffering.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.280
Abortion bans increase maternal mortality,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.840
increases infant mortality,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.920
it worsens outcomes for existing children,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.960
makes it less likely that women will have

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.900
planned pregnancies later on in her life,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.320
and it makes it less likely that

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.920
she will make aspirations for herself

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.640
and meet those goals for herself.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.160
And it worsens financial outcomes for families.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.380
Forced birth causes extreme mental anguish and anxiety.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.120
And abortion pans don't even reduce the abortion rate.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.560
Its only goal is to increase the suffering of women

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.440
and force them into reproducing for their government

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.980
at the risk of their health,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.840
their family,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.000
their finances,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.080
and their dignity. In short,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.000
if there is any abortion that makes you uncomfortable,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.060
I do not care.
