00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Men ask you “what do you bring to the table?”

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.720
and women are like,

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:05.241
“I am the table”

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:07.641
I hear you, I see you,

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.161
but let's dissect that a little.

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:10.161
I'm gonna be honest,

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:13.141
some of our tables are coming with three legs.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.680
you wanna be the table?

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:18.781
then we should be making sure that our table is strong and firm,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.920
comes with four legs,

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:20.961
and can stand on its own!

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.241
we truly need to be honest with ourselves,

00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:26.801
are we actually coming with strong foundations?

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:28.801
or are we three legged tables?

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:32.821
as women we often struggle to regulate our own emotions

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.360
so you're probably asking okay

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:36.481
how do I create a firm foundation?

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:38.521
learn how to emotionally regulate,

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:39.901
set boundaries,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.300
and heal past traumas,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.640
don't be self centered.

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:47.241
understanding what you have to offer doesn't mean the world revolves around you

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:49.681
it's not, that's not what life is about okay

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.501
life is about serving others,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.460
friends, family members,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.100
a man that you plan to marry.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.300
if you can't emotionally regulate,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.480
be there for others,

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:01.961
and understand that the world does not revolve around you.

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:03.561
we have some work to do,

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.741
and you have to work on your table

00:01:05.742 --> 00:01:06.961
be Bob the builder

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:08.241
and work on your table!

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:11.801
okay your table should come with four legs and stand on its own.

00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:13.161
next time a man ask you

00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:14.901
what do you bring to the table?

00:01:14.902 --> 00:01:16.641
you can be honest and say,

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:18.181
I am the table!

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.860
a strong stable table!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.920
I'm healed from past trauma,

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:23.561
I'm emotionally regulated,

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:25.350
and I love to serve others.
