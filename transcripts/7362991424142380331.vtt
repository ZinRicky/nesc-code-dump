00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.913
Can somebody please tell me why 

00:00:01.914 --> 00:00:04.321
healthcare in America is so darn expensive

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:09.401
okay this is also a friendly reminder to be careful with new knives

00:00:09.402 --> 00:00:11.641
because I was washing them

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:15.561
I was scrubbing them and it slipped for my little girl grip doesn't matter

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:17.781
I sliced my arm open

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.040
had to go to urgent care

00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:23.481
the ER and apparently it cost like 700 something dollars

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:24.621
so that's great

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.160
and that was a week ago

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:26.961
they glued me shut

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:28.161
they didn't even stitch me

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:30.081
which I'm pretty sure I needed stitches

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:31.041
it was that bad

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.341
and then today

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.760
I’m getting ready to go to the gym

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:36.721
and the glue just falls off

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:39.281
I'm gonna spare you the disgusting details

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:41.281
but it opened okay

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:43.891
so I go back to urgent care today Sunday 

00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:45.801
to see if they can patch me up

00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:47.801
fix me up and they're like yeah no

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:51.761
we can't close wounds after like 24 hours of injury

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:52.986
It’s been a week 

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:55.941
so I'm left to just kind of figure it out

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.560
they said it should just heal and scab

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:01.161
so now I'm gonna be left with a giant scar

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:01.681
not only that

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:05.160
they're like you could use sterile strips to close it

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:06.641
and I had to do that myself

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:08.401
yeah so now I have this

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.744
I didn't have Scissors to cut the tape

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.680
but why is healthcare so expensive

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:13.949
please tell me why, please 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.921
Anyways I just had to get that off my chest

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:17.241
I just finished working out

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:18.761
so I guess I'm also curious

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:22.201
do you have a health related injury or accident that happened

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:23.081
that you're just like

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.161
why am I now in debt

00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:27.161
I'm curious if you have injured yourself

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:28.121
um okay

00:01:28.122 --> 00:01:30.424
I have to go the ACS is off so you can hear me so bye
