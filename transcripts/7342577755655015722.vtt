00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.400
hey guys good morning

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.800
it's been a while since I checked in and just did just like

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:05.400
a general update video

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.120
I can hear my kids yelling at each other

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.520
usually when I get on here I'm like

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.920
we've got important things to discuss

00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:11.400
let's unpack some shit

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.500
so it's been a really long time since I've just done a general update

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.240
we just got back from an amazing trip to Vermont with my sister and her family

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.280
my sensory kiddo uh

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.240
had a really tough time

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.960
I don't think snowboarding is gonna be

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:25.840
I don't think the winter sports are gonna be thing

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:27.240
but I've been a skier my whole life

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.360
I had an amazing time

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:28.920
that being said

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.960
it's really great to be home

00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:31.560
I'm excited to be back in my house

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:32.960
I have a lot of laundry to do

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:35.000
we are getting ready to do school

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.400
and we have Charleston Wine and Food Festival coming up this weekend

00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:39.680
which is a huge food festival here in Charleston

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:41.680
and I'm going to be a social media ambassador for it

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:43.000
it swarms get excited

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.000
so check out my Instagram

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.680
I'm gonna be posting all of the live updates from it

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:48.760
and all sorts of fun little outfits

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:49.520
with that being said

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:51.660
I don't think I've done my hair in about like 9 days

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.320
and today I got to use my first round of hand me downs from big brother for Levi

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:57.560
and it kind of blew my mind how fast

00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:58.700
these kids are growing
