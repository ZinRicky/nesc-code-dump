00:00.000 --> 00:03.320
The other day, when my husband and I were talking about our childhood

00:03.321 --> 00:07.401
favorite candies, he mentioned that he was obsessed with Jolly Ranchers,

00:07.402 --> 00:09.081
but he hasn't had them in a while,

00:09.082 --> 00:11.441
so I decided to make him some today.

00:11.442 --> 00:13.841
His favorite flavors are apple and watermelon,

00:13.842 --> 00:15.481
so that's what we went with.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.481
I started by combining some water,

00:17.482 --> 00:18.801
sugar, and corn syrup.

00:18.802 --> 00:21.041
Brought that to 310 degrees,

00:21.042 --> 00:23.401
and then I added in my watermelon extract,

00:23.402 --> 00:26.001
some malic acid, some pink color.

00:26.002 --> 00:28.681
This is the stage where I had to work very quickly

00:28.682 --> 00:30.801
because my mixture began to harden.

00:30.802 --> 00:32.721
So I poured that into my silicone molds

00:32.722 --> 00:35.041
before moving on to my second flavor,

00:35.042 --> 00:38.241
which was green apple. So I added some apple extract,

00:38.242 --> 00:39.041
malic acid,

00:39.042 --> 00:43.021
and green color this time before pouring it into my remaining molds.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.560
After about an hour and a half to two hours,

00:45.561 --> 00:47.281
my Jolly Ranchers had hardened,

00:47.282 --> 00:50.561
so I popped them out and transferred them over to a bowl.

00:50.562 --> 00:52.161
These are so nostalgic to him,

00:52.162 --> 00:54.481
so I was really excited for him to try.

00:54.482 --> 00:56.441
I ended up preferring the apple ones

00:56.442 --> 00:58.401
where he preferred the watermelon ones,

00:58.402 --> 01:01.221
but before the day was over, the bowl was gone.
