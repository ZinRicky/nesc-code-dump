00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.060
you know what I'm really sick of

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.280
I'm really sick of seeing influencers on here and I've got heaps of trolls

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:11.561
I am in all the forums so the trolls come to my account and then they go

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:15.321
ooh it's an awful man hating feminist and then they go and take all my videos

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:17.081
repost them and put them in forums

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:19.681
and then they send all the little troll friends to come and say

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:21.381
really meaningless stuff on my post

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.760
and then sometimes I go and look at who these trolls are following

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:27.541
and they're following the hot girl influences

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.620
they're following all these influences that we all know and that we all watch

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.980
and that we all love get ready with me etcetera

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.560
and if just one of these influences from time to time spoke more about feminism

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:46.401
patriarch inequality it's not that hard to do

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:48.001
it's not rocket science

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:54.661
like you could speak out on it a little bit more like why is this so Silo

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.800
like what are you doing like what is your purpose in this world

00:00:58.801 --> 00:00:59.901
what is your purpose

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.100
are you happy to continue being a vessel for data collection

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.580
a vessel for consumerism

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.200
a vessel for advertisers to use and selling your body in that way

00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:15.621
is that cause you can do that and I'm not against that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.540
but is that your only purpose and meaning in life

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.980
like do you have any other things that you care about

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.100
is there has there ever occurred to you to use your platform

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.900
has it like I just

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.940
I just don't understand how

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.400
it would never occur to you that you got this incredible privilege

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:36.801
this incredible platform

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:40.141
all these people who are just hanging on your every word

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.220
and that you could use that to make the world better place

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.980
not one product at a time

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.060
but one idea at a time

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.100
you can do both you can be like influencer great

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.920
great job love that for you

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:58.081
happy for you but like you could do more

00:01:58.082 --> 00:02:01.101
you could do but like right now

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.660
the I Place is invading rougher

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.320
the met and you're all commenting on Met Gala

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:11.261
they did it while the Met Gala was happening like

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.740
do you care

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.580
like do you have a conscience

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.520
do you ever think like wow

00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:26.461
most people just have to show up on a Sunday and go to a rally

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.000
most people just have to like

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.381
try to scrape together some coffee money so that they can donate

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.200
like most people are just sharing to their Instagram Stories

00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:37.901
hoping they're like a handful of friends and family see stuff and care enough

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.380
you have like millions of followers

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.500
like does it ever occur to you

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.820
does it ever occur to you is what I'd like to know
