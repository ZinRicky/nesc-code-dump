00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.040
I get asked this all the time about this snuggly,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.200
delicious sweater.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.120
I'm not trying to sell you shit.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.240
I'm not making no fucking commission.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.040
I. When I am,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.580
I make it clearer than I am.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.540
I got this from a little Fucking Farm store

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.020
website called Murdoch's.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.280
The thing is,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.480
it's such a tiny little store,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.760
their fucking online is never working.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.640
They have stores in, like,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.300
Colorado, Wyoming.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.040
I don't fucking know if you go to, like,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.120
Amazon or any place or just the fucking internet.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.020
Go to Google and search asymmetrical zipper

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.540
cowbell neck sweater,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.820
and similar things will come up. Ha ha.
