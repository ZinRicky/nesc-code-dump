00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Welcome to my busy day in the life.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.820
I'm gonna start by cooking some poached eggs for the kids.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.960
Just cleaned and polished the stove.

00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:08.661
Time to relight the pilot light.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.720
I think poached eggs are my favourite type of egg.

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:12.121
But I do prefer them from restaurants

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:15.061
when I don't have to put all the effort in to get the reward.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.500
Best poached egg I ever ate was from the Ruby Slipper in New Orleans.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.480
I have a busy day ahead today,

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:22.281
as with every other day here.

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:23.561
My mother in law is telling me

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:26.561
that the air conditioning is leaking underneath the house.

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:28.641
I can smell something from the events,

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:31.721
so we went to investigate and it's bad news.

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:32.721
While she deals with that,

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:34.841
I'm gonna go ahead and go to the lawyer's office

00:00:34.842 --> 00:00:36.221
and get me some coffee.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.860
And then I head to my doctor's for some vein surgery.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.720
When I got home, my daughter decided to knot a comb up in her hair.

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.161
Once I detangled the comb,

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:49.761
I thought I would try to suck out the trip line

00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:50.861
for the air conditioner.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.400
This is absolutely nothing.

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:57.721
I'm just wasting my time.

00:00:57.722 --> 00:00:59.601
The water did throw up on the underneath the house,

00:00:59.602 --> 00:01:02.081
so that was a plus. We will have to re address that later.

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:04.261
Why don't you pick a beanie in there?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.880
River was enjoying helping me with the air conditioner

00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:09.861
and checking out the garden.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.620
Pushing down a little bit so I can see.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.060
Since We're all outside. I decided that we should practice cricket.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.920
I think it's important for the kids

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:20.441
to know a little bit about their heritage

00:01:20.442 --> 00:01:22.181
and to learn some British sports

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.940
one more time.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.460
I have some great memories of playing cricket with my dad as a kid.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.400
Then it's time to go inside and make some dinner.

00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:39.721
I am not in the mood to cook,

00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:41.081
but I will cook some food

00:01:41.082 --> 00:01:43.661
because we live in the middle of nowhere and I don't have much choice.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.680
I had a marinating piece of flank steak in the fridge,

00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:48.021
so we went for that.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.440
We have hardly any meat left.

00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:54.801
We have a quarter of a cow on back order

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:58.421
and we're waiting for that to be butchered as we speak.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.680
Then it's time to milk Cora and get all these kids in the bath.

00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:04.241
I'm gonna sit here on the toilet while they get a bath

00:02:04.242 --> 00:02:05.366
and then I'm gonna go to bed.
