00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.360
So I don't really speak about this topic anymore on here, um,

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:04.681
for my own reasons,

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.721
although I have spoken about it in the past.

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:07.281
But this week,

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:09.381
it has just been confirmed that Israel

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.280
how to target missile strike on the World Central Kitchen.

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:15.681
And if you've been following along with any of my commentary

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.601
on this issue,

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:20.981
you know that my heart and my stances with the civilians

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.740
and just the egregious,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.420
flagrant disregard for innocent human life that is happening

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.800
is astounding.

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.721
And I don't need anybody in my comments tell me, like,

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:31.561
whose fault it is,

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:34.121
because there's very impassioned opinions on both sides.

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:35.041
You know, which came first,

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:35.961
the chicken or the egg?

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:39.921
But what is clear to me is that Israel is not taking into account

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:43.441
whatsoever the human life cost,

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:46.421
which makes me believe that they do not value

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.200
gods and lives the same way.

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:51.641
And Hamas, who is responsible for this current escalation of violence,

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:53.721
made absolutely no plans

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:55.961
for the safety or well being of the Palestinian people.

00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:58.021
No one here gives a shit about the people,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.378
except maybe World Central Kitchen.
