00:00.080 --> 00:02.280
I was in the midst of winding down for the day,

00:02.281 --> 00:05.161
and my husband came in giving me a very specific look,

00:05.162 --> 00:06.881
which could only mean one thing.

00:06.882 --> 00:08.321
We were craving the same thing,

00:08.322 --> 00:11.461
so we ended up at the Japanese barbecue.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.200
If there's an all you can eat option,

00:13.201 --> 00:14.721
that's always what we choose.

00:14.722 --> 00:16.441
We tend to have the same cravings lately,

00:16.442 --> 00:17.681
so this was perfect.

00:17.682 --> 00:20.641
He ordered all the meat, and I ordered all the sides.

00:20.642 --> 00:22.521
Obviously had to get shishito peppers,

00:22.522 --> 00:24.201
some different cuts of beef.

00:24.202 --> 00:26.921
I got this sushi with steak on top,

00:26.922 --> 00:30.081
some kimchi, and then also these Chile edamame,

00:30.082 --> 00:32.561
fried gyoza, smashed cucumber salad,

00:32.562 --> 00:35.181
bacon chips, which lucky loves to eat.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.920
I didn't realize how hungry I was

00:36.921 --> 00:39.441
until we got in there and started eating. Look,

00:39.442 --> 00:41.361
he's always in charge of grilling all the meat,

00:41.362 --> 00:42.961
so he got started on that,

00:42.962 --> 00:47.241
while I had some of that beef fried rice with shishito peppers.

00:47.242 --> 00:48.281
This is so good.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.481
I don't know what it is about shishito peppers.

00:50.482 --> 00:52.861
We have to get them every time we eat out.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.520
The sushi was really good as well,

00:54.521 --> 00:58.581
but I love having fresh sides like cucumber salad and kimchi.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.360
By this time, the meat was done grilling,

01:00.361 --> 01:03.281
and I always get the first round, and he always gets the second.

01:03.282 --> 01:05.001
I don't know what it is about kimchi,

01:05.002 --> 01:07.841
but I've been on a real kimchi kick this pregnancy.

01:07.842 --> 01:12.001
And combination of kimchi with beef and rice.

01:12.002 --> 01:13.481
You guys It's so good.

01:13.482 --> 01:16.561
We're done with all of the things that we ordered for the first round,

01:16.562 --> 01:20.841
so we went in for seconds and got basically all the same things again.

01:20.842 --> 01:25.281
It felt like we had an unlimited amount of rice that just kept coming.

01:25.282 --> 01:28.081
So we had eight to nine balls of rice at this point.

01:28.082 --> 01:29.521
Lucky was still going strong,

01:29.522 --> 01:33.801
but I clocked out and ordered some mango mochi and green tea ice cream.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.001
I always need something sweet after I eat,

01:36.002 --> 01:39.461
but I also ended up having a few bites of his food after that.
