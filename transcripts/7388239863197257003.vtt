00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.200
What is it like to be an Airbnb host?

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:04.781
From somebody who's been hosting for four years.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.800
So, a little background on me.

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:10.201
I'm a traditional wife. Don't like using the word tried wife,

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:11.801
because that kinda comes across as something else,

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:13.641
but my husband's in the army,

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:15.121
I stay at home and raise our children.

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:20.581
I homeschool. And when we started doing Airbnb in our very first duplex,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.360
it was just like the best thing that ever happened to us.

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.301
It changed our income.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.440
It will be went from this long term running $900 per night, uh,

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:30.401
per side. Sorry,

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:34.441
per month. To getting $3,000 per side of our duplex per month.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:34.841
So, like,

00:00:34.842 --> 00:00:35.961
our income just jumped.

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:39.481
And it was a great thing that I could do while raising our children.

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:41.081
At the time, I only had two babies,

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.161
so, you know,

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:43.241
it was something I could do

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.601
and not have my babies in daycare,

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:46.101
which was a big thing for me.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.640
So I just got off the phone with Airbnb.

00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:51.701
For another disturbance at one of our listings,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.200
and so I'm just frustrated right now.

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:55.041
Um, as I said,

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:57.141
I've been working with Airbnb for four years.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.000
I guess I'm just gonna do some pros and cons

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.261
on running an Airbnb in your home.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.920
So pro 1.

00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:06.201
They pay good money. So compared to long term,

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:08.321
running, this makes you more money,

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:11.001
generally speaking. It doesn't mean you make more profit,

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.721
cause that just depends on your Overheads how much your mortgage is.

00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:17.201
If you have a mortgage. If you're doing Airbnb. Arbitrage.

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.301
I hate that word.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.360
If you're running from someone else and sub letting on Airbnb.

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:24.101
Or if you own your own home,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.400
or 10 your RV. We use RVs,

00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:30.321
and we use homes, and I also, um,

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:31.521
manage homes for other people.

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:34.161
So it really just depends on your overhead.

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:35.641
If you're gonna make the profit or not.

00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:38.501
But it does pay more than long term, generally.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.760
Pro number two, and this is my big one,

00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.101
that you have control over your home.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.640
With having a long term guest.

00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:48.241
And you never know if they're gonna come back after 12 months.

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:49.761
To completely trashed house.

00:01:49.762 --> 00:01:51.721
I've seen some really bad ones.

00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:54.301
Roaches, dogs eating walls.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.320
That's like the worst thing.

00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:57.081
And then you just get the deposit back

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:59.401
when they've done like $20,000 worth of damage.

00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:00.641
You get what, like two grand?

00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:01.741
What's that gonna do?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.720
And good luck chasing people down like that in court.

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.441
I've seen some really bad examples of that.

00:02:06.442 --> 00:02:08.021
Now I'm gonna go to my cons,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.880
and these have been stacking up lately,

00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:11.441
so I just kinda feel like doing this video.

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:14.121
Um, I'm not saying that I'm quitting Airbnb.

00:02:14.122 --> 00:02:15.401
Maybe I should do the other headline.

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:20.081
I'm quitting Airbnb. Biggest calm would be never having any time off.

00:02:20.082 --> 00:02:22.101
It's kinda echo in here. Let's go somewhere else.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.200
You never get any time off.

00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:26.761
Now I'm hearing a dryer. Echo dryer.

00:02:26.762 --> 00:02:29.401
What's better? I'm in my favourite listing right now

00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:30.781
and this is my beautiful home.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.040
You never get time off?

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:35.041
I know my working hours are very limited during the day,

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:35.481
so, like,

00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:37.081
I only work two hours one day.

00:02:37.082 --> 00:02:39.601
One day I work 10 hours. If I'm staging a listing,

00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:41.001
I'm busting my ass working,

00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:43.581
you know, the whole day and sleeping a very few hours,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.380
but there's never time off.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.640
I've literally had to message someone while I was in labour.

00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:51.921
I've had to message someone when I was sitting next to my dying nephew.

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:54.361
He was dying of cancer just a few months ago,

00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:56.921
and I had a guest messaging me about their inconvenience

00:02:56.922 --> 00:02:59.981
at one of my homes as I'm watching him die of cancer.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.520
Yes, we could use other people to help us with this.

00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:06.121
We could have other people work with us and answer messages.

00:03:06.122 --> 00:03:08.121
But overall, when you're running an Airbnb,

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:10.701
sometimes you're the only person that can answer that question.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.880
Sometimes the person you have answering messages,

00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:14.781
like my husband, my mother in law,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.940
some of our employees, sometimes they just cannot answer that question.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.700
So it's up to me to answer those questions.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.480
The other negative part is Airbnb support.

00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.081
Sometimes they can be really helpful,

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:30.081
but lately I've noticed that they're just giving people money back

00:03:30.082 --> 00:03:31.601
when they're just complaining about something.

00:03:31.602 --> 00:03:32.721
They can't even prove this.

00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:34.721
If you know Airbnb, you know what I'm talking about.

00:03:34.722 --> 00:03:36.801
When A guest complains about something,

00:03:36.802 --> 00:03:39.741
they have to have evidence and proof to get to get a refund.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.600
I'm coming into the fact that I'm there getting a refund within

00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:44.541
like 30 minutes of making a complaint.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.280
There's no evidence for the complaint.

00:03:46.281 --> 00:03:47.601
They're not showing me evidence.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.001
The guest never contacted me or message me,

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:51.321
and they're getting a full refund

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.080
they don't like the smell of the cleaning products that we used.

00:03:54.081 --> 00:03:56.201
That's something that I had actually happened recently.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:59.261
The guest complained that it smelled like cleaning products,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.760
and we don't use a lot of smell and perfume.

00:04:01.761 --> 00:04:04.021
They just smell like laundry detergent,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.720
and that wasn't good for them.

00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:07.461
And they got a full refund.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.900
They got the refund

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.800
and I complained, and I also got my money back.

00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:15.241
But it was just a whole situation that I wasn't prepared for

00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:16.661
after four years of hosting.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.580
This happened twice to me recently.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.760
Um, so, yeah,

00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:23.901
lack of support from Airbnb and their constant rule changing policies.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.560
It's insane.

00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:27.501
You feel like you have to fight every single day to get your money.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.560
Now don't even get me started on Verbo.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.561
I do like Verbo guests better.

00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:34.281
They seem to vet there, then do better background checks.

00:04:34.282 --> 00:04:36.641
My quality of Verbo guests are just so much better.

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:39.801
I've never in 4 years had an issue with a Verbo guest,

00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:42.741
but Verbo as themselves or I don't like their software,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.280
I don't like their app. Um,

00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:46.081
you Click on a message. Oh,

00:04:46.082 --> 00:04:47.441
you got a message from. From.

00:04:47.442 --> 00:04:49.081
From Virgo and from a Virgo guest.

00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:50.841
And I click on it, and it just, like,

00:04:50.842 --> 00:04:51.921
just swirling, swirling, swirling.

00:04:51.922 --> 00:04:52.941
It will not load.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.400
And then within the five minutes I'm sitting there waiting,

00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:56.641
I kinda lost interest. And then I swipe away,

00:04:56.642 --> 00:04:58.581
and then I forgot that person even message me.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.120
So overall, recently.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.280
I've really been thinking about going back to long term renting only,

00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:05.741
even though that's not what I suggest to anybody,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.120
but I'm just burnt out. It's been four years.

00:05:08.121 --> 00:05:10.601
I'm burnt out. I really enjoy the money.

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:13.321
I can't say I don't, but I'm burnt the fuck out.

00:05:13.322 --> 00:05:14.561
This person is just tired.

00:05:14.562 --> 00:05:16.341
I'm tired. I'm tired.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.280
So now we're staying on Airbnb for now.

00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:20.561
We're doing short term rentals only,

00:05:20.562 --> 00:05:24.701
should I say. But I'm so close. What do you guys think?
