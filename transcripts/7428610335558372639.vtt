Hey dude, did you know since Trump got rid of rose,

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:03.641
some states may revert back to laws

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:05.901
that almost totally outlash remorse?

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.960
In Arizona, that law dates back to 1864.

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:10.001
Letting Trump in that project

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:14.101
2025 could literally send women's progress back to the wild, wild West.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.880
Howdy. Sorry for delay.

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:20.361
There's a little surge pressing on my horse carriage over here.

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:22.301
But let's take a look at you.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.820
Wait, you're my doctor?

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.180
This here is my assistant.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.960
Does he have a medical degree?

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.881
They didn't really have an education like that back then.

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:33.481
Will my insurance cover this?

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:35.681
What's that? My ass insurance is that?

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:38.521
A little spoonful of mercury will probably set you right.

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:39.661
They really did that?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.280
Restricting reproductive rights to the Abraham Lincoln era

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:45.921
has cascading effects on women's economic and educational prospects.

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:48.201
So if he packs the court again,

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:51.421
all legal protections are at risk when it comes to discrimination.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.800
I mean, if that's bothering you

00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.701
should probably just rub a little mustard on it.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.520
This affects men too. If women don't have control over their bodies,

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.661
a lot more men are going to become early baby daddies.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.600
Or maybe have to wear a condom forever.

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:08.621
There's a ton of reasons why men shouldn't pull out of this election.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.400
Hold on, I'm jotting this down.

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:14.401
Now you just go to wild wild west dot.

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:16.581
I will vote com for voter information.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.100
I will vote com for information.
