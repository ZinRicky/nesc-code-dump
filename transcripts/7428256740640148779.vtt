00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.560
Tell me how. I am a mom of three kids.

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:05.041
I homeschool two of them. I have a cold today.

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:05.561
I'm, like,

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:08.001
sniffly and stuffy, and I feel like shit,

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:09.481
and I'm sitting in bed doing laundry,

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:14.021
and somehow this is, like a luxurious break.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.080
Like, the craziest things become luxuries

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:17.881
when you have kids around all the time.

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:21.841
Just being able to sit here and do one task without being asked to do,

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:22.961
like, six other ones.

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:24.761
Like, I've got a little Theraflu.

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:27.041
I might put on some Netflix and fold,

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:28.801
like, 3 loads of laundry today.

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:31.261
And for a stay at home mom slash homeschool mom,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.940
that's like.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.660
It's like a vacation.
