It always amazes me to see

00:01.280 --> 00:03.440
how much disdain our culture has for young children.

00:03.440 --> 00:05.240
It seems like everywhere I look on social media,

00:05.240 --> 00:08.720
there are grumpy people complaining that children exist.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.280
In restaurants, in Costco,

00:11.280 --> 00:12.320
on airplanes.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.160
Like, people are just so inconvenience

00:14.160 --> 00:16.840
and so upset by families with young children.

00:16.840 --> 00:20.200
It's crazy because we live in a society that is so old.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.640
Like, our generation is not going to have

00:22.640 --> 00:25.480
a lot of younger people around to take care of us

00:25.480 --> 00:26.960
or just to be around us.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.680
And so you would think that we would all recognize this

00:29.680 --> 00:31.200
and we would recognize that, yeah,

00:31.200 --> 00:32.840
those kids that are whining

00:32.840 --> 00:35.000
and crying in grocery stores and causing a fuss,

00:35.000 --> 00:35.840
like, they're loud,

00:35.840 --> 00:37.600
but they are our future.

00:37.600 --> 00:38.640
But no, instead

00:38.640 --> 00:40.160
we just wish that they didn't exist

00:40.160 --> 00:42.320
because they're just so inconvenient to us.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.080
So instead we would rather just sit in silence

00:45.080 --> 00:46.820
with our aging selves

00:46.840 --> 00:48.560
doing nothing but consuming.

00:48.560 --> 00:49.360
Like, I look at that

00:49.360 --> 00:50.160
and I'm like,

00:50.520 --> 00:51.400
like, my generation,

00:51.400 --> 00:51.880
millennials,

00:51.880 --> 00:53.520
I don't wanna grow old with you people.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.920
You people are a tragedy and lame.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.120
I always hear people say, like,

00:57.120 --> 00:58.280
leave your kids at home

00:58.280 --> 00:59.640
when you're gonna go into public.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.320
Like, why don't you stay at home? Why don't.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.760
Why do I have to be around you and your grumpy

01:03.760 --> 01:04.840
sour attitude?

01:04.840 --> 01:07.600
Like, that's way more annoying than a toddler crying.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.040
It's honestly just so annoying.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.320
So if you're a parent that has small Children,

01:11.320 --> 01:13.120
please bring them out into public more,

01:13.120 --> 01:14.560
please. Bring them to the grocery store,

01:14.560 --> 01:15.560
to the restaurant,

01:15.560 --> 01:17.560
on the flight to church, everywhere.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.000
And if they cause a scene

01:19.000 --> 01:21.860
and they make these grumpy people feel uncomfortable,

01:21.880 --> 01:22.601
all the better.
