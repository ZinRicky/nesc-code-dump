00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.400
Since some people in the comments want to stir up some

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:05.121
ballerina farm esque stove drama on my page,

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:08.041
I thought I'd clean up a few questions about my stove.

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:10.321
Just show you how easy it is to grab one of these stoves

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:11.781
for a pretty reasonable price.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.920
This is a Chambers Model C.

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:18.281
This is a gas stove that can be set to propane or natural gas

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:19.881
depending on what you need it to be.

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:22.721
When I got it it was set for natural gas and I changed the propane.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.601
Super easy. You just adjust the burners.

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:26.721
Mine is a late 1950s model,

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:28.721
one of the last ones they made before they changed

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:31.121
like a 70s model. I haven't seen in person,

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:33.401
but let's see if we can find some on marketplace

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:37.381
since I swear to you I got mine on marketplace for $200.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.120
So I'm gonna do a search for Atlanta because that's where I am

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:43.201
and the first one that pops up is one that's been for sale since.

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:47.121
I previously was looking to buy mine and this is beautiful,

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:49.761
but it's at an antique store and it's super overpriced.

00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:52.321
The colour makes you think that it's worth more,

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:55.201
but being an antique store you don't even know if it works.

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:59.361
Now this guy. He also was selling when I bought mine

00:00:59.362 --> 00:01:03.561
and I almost bought this one because it had the firmer baker

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.381
which is right there on top of firmerwell Baker

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.200
and they're really hard To find they're actually worth like

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.641
500 bucks by themselves. And he kinda knew that.

00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:11.361
And the stove was in a terrible condition.

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:14.841
But all the extra parts were worth more than the stove,

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.041
as you can see here.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:18.481
There's lots of rust right here on the chrome right here.

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:20.501
This stove would need to be rechromed.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.480
That wouldn't buff out. That's just lots of surface rust.

00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:25.481
The knobs right here got surface rust.

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:27.241
And there's lots of rust going on inside here.

00:01:27.242 --> 00:01:28.941
This is not been stored well.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.520
Mine had a little bit of rust and dirt,

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:32.381
but not like this. This is a lot.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.680
And it would need, you know,

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:36.781
A severe restoration by professional.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.200
Not something you could handle

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:39.701
unless you had, um,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.500
machines to re chrome and re enamel things.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.960
So this is why this guy still has it.

00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:46.321
And I think he's an antique store or antique booth, too.

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:48.841
And then I got tricked by this stupid Etsy link.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:49.521
Like, oh my gosh,

00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:50.641
I hate it on marketplace. I'm like,

00:01:50.642 --> 00:01:51.721
oh my god, such a cute item!

00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:52.361
And I'm like, no,

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:53.961
it's a link. Don't take me there.

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:57.081
Okay, so I don't think this is definitely my chambers,

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:58.881
but super cute nonetheless.

00:01:58.882 --> 00:02:01.761
Let's carry on looking. This is a cute Roper stove.

00:02:01.762 --> 00:02:02.921
Roper stoves are really cheap.

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:05.041
Back in the day, chambers was not a cheap stove.

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:07.841
So they still are cheap now. $75.

00:02:07.842 --> 00:02:11.761
It looks kinda rough. I'm not seeing anymore locally,

00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:13.981
so let's Widen the search.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.580
Okay, let's see

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.480
those two. Original.

00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:21.201
Oh, I saw one there.

00:02:21.202 --> 00:02:23.141
Why did I scroll by? I scroll by one.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.040
My dogs won't stop barking.

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:27.881
This is a cute tapanga stove.

00:02:27.882 --> 00:02:29.601
This is actually really beautiful,

00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:33.601
and I would definitely consider purchasing this one.

00:02:33.602 --> 00:02:34.561
Let's do some more research.

00:02:34.562 --> 00:02:36.561
For $200, that is a beautiful stove.

00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:38.941
And that looks like it was in pretty good condition as well.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960
Life of having livestock. Guardian dogs at night.

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:42.921
They do not shut up all night long.

00:02:42.922 --> 00:02:44.721
Okay, I was actually like,

00:02:44.722 --> 00:02:47.861
why is this so expensive? It does come with a backsplash and event hood,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.000
but they're not. Chambers vent hood.

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:51.281
You can get a chambers vent hood.

00:02:51.282 --> 00:02:52.781
I've seen them once or twice,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.840
but, um,

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.461
this is severely overpriced.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.080
It's in decent condition, but again,

00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:58.401
this is like a vendor or, like,

00:02:58.402 --> 00:03:00.041
an antique booth, so

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:02.921
they're actually gonna have absolutely no information about the stove.

00:03:02.922 --> 00:03:03.961
They're not gonna know anything about it.

00:03:03.962 --> 00:03:05.181
They're not gonna know if it works,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200
but they wanna charge you, like,

00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:09.661
$2,000 for it, when you could get something similar for, like, $500.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.280
You just to keep looking. I wouldn't buy from a.

00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.081
An antique booth,

00:03:13.082 --> 00:03:16.441
because they literally are not gonna help you set it up.

00:03:16.442 --> 00:03:18.141
They're not gonna help you do anything,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.220
and it's gonna be filthy dirty.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.600
So if you're gonna pay that price,

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.501
get it from an antique stove restoration company,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.040
not from a booth. Yeah,

00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:27.921
I would stay Away from this one,

00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:30.441
it's severely overpriced. For that price,

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:32.161
I would want it to be fully renovated.

00:03:32.162 --> 00:03:33.981
Or half renovated at least.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.900
Refurbish, whatever you wanna call it.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.340
I spy another one right there. $500.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.240
This one doesn't look well.

00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.281
It's got a lot of surface rust in the back there.

00:03:45.282 --> 00:03:47.781
Let's see where this one is.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.120
I don't know. It says working when removed.

00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:54.561
So that's like a. A classic line that a lot of people like to say,

00:03:54.562 --> 00:03:55.901
like, working when removed.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.440
Well, it worked when it was removed,

00:03:57.441 --> 00:03:59.541
but a lot of things that happened since then.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.080
Mine was working when it was removed,

00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:04.541
but then it didn't work because it had cockroaches in the gas line,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.920
so they had to be cleaned out.

00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:06.321
But, yeah,

00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:07.321
just because it was working.

00:04:07.322 --> 00:04:08.961
Were removed. Even just moving the stove

00:04:08.962 --> 00:04:11.241
can knock some of the settings out of alignment,

00:04:11.242 --> 00:04:13.001
and it won't work again. So

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:14.521
just because it was working

00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:16.661
doesn't mean that you're not gonna have to help,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.240
like, read the manual or have someone come out.

00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:20.681
If you don't. If you're not handy,

00:04:20.682 --> 00:04:21.441
you might have to have, like,

00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:23.341
a handyman or a gas person.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.960
And gas people don't like to fuck with these.

00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:26.241
They want you to just, like,

00:04:26.242 --> 00:04:29.241
not use them and put them in the trash pile and buy a brand new one.

00:04:29.242 --> 00:04:31.401
So this is definitely an older model.

00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:32.481
I can see the, uh.

00:04:32.482 --> 00:04:33.721
The dials were a different colour.

00:04:33.722 --> 00:04:36.001
That means They're like late 40s,

00:04:36.002 --> 00:04:38.881
early 50s. And this is an older one, 1946.

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:41.381
I don't like this model. This one had the, uh,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.200
mother in law cover, they call it.

00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:44.481
So like when your mother in law came over,

00:04:44.482 --> 00:04:46.961
you could just like slap the cover down and cover up your messes.

00:04:46.962 --> 00:04:48.921
This one has it too. This one's $200.

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:50.321
It's not bad. Oh, no, sorry.

00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:52.101
Just kidding. That's not a chambers.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.760
Oh, this one's beautiful.

00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:57.401
I love the colour. So they have some beautiful green ones and a blue,

00:04:57.402 --> 00:04:58.781
a pink, a yellow.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.380
I think the yellow is my favourite.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.700
They're all like these candy pastel colours.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.400
I think this is the one that Rachel Ray had in her kitchen too.

00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:06.641
Again, this is the low back one,

00:05:06.642 --> 00:05:07.721
so it's older than mine.

00:05:07.722 --> 00:05:10.801
I've not ever seen one that has the same rings as me at mine.

00:05:10.802 --> 00:05:12.241
Even like the same time period.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.240
I'm trying to find a replacement ring because when I picked mine up,

00:05:15.241 --> 00:05:16.481
I dropped it and cracked it.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.761
So I really need to find one,

00:05:17.762 --> 00:05:20.661
but I haven't seen one. This one says,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.680
uh, very rare.

00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:24.561
They have this. Overpriced.

00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:25.801
Like just because it's the colour.

00:05:25.802 --> 00:05:26.601
Yes,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.880
it's still overpriced. It doesn't,

00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:30.321
it doesn't. It's not being refurbished.

00:05:30.322 --> 00:05:32.661
But here again is a mint green one again.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.760
Oh, I didn't click on that one.

00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:35.541
That one's 400 dollar. That one's old.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.440
I probably wouldn't get that one.

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:38.081
That was pretty old.

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:40.701
That's like one Of their first models that look like that.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.900
Personally,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.320
unless you're gonna get that one fully refurbished professionally,

00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:46.801
I wouldn't get that one. Here's another mint green one.

00:05:46.802 --> 00:05:49.501
15. I don't know why they had it for 4,000, but

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.440
I don't know if that's dirty or they're not.

00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:55.121
So if they now were chipped off there,

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:57.881
I think that's just dirt. You can see that door handle.

00:05:57.882 --> 00:05:59.241
The door, the storage door,

00:05:59.242 --> 00:06:01.221
pantry door there has been held up by string,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.560
so that means the spring needs replacing.

00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.041
There um,

00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:06.581
doesn't look that bad honestly.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.500
Just the price. 15.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.440
It looks real rough and dirty,

00:06:10.441 --> 00:06:14.761
but could be a good one. But 15?

00:06:14.762 --> 00:06:17.081
That's kinda high. I probably wouldn't pay that.

00:06:17.082 --> 00:06:19.521
If it was white, it wouldn't be worth anywhere near that much.

00:06:19.522 --> 00:06:20.201
But it's green,

00:06:20.202 --> 00:06:23.261
so maybe if you really wanted green one you'd pay that much.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.280
See, this one's 2:25,

00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:26.801
I think. No,

00:06:26.802 --> 00:06:27.801
I haven't seen this one before.

00:06:27.802 --> 00:06:30.441
This one's old. This one's older.

00:06:30.442 --> 00:06:34.581
I I I like to try to stay between the the late 1950s

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.280
because that was like

00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:42.021
the last time they made them in that style that I like.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.320
Yep. There's another older ones.

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:46.241
400 if you like this style.

00:06:46.242 --> 00:06:48.401
As the first one I ever saw was an older one,

00:06:48.402 --> 00:06:50.581
so I fell in love with it when it was like a

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.060
an early 50s model and I liked it.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.780
I just went out to see this fridge there.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.360
Can't even say It. These stoves are so cool.

00:07:01.361 --> 00:07:02.481
I wouldn't want one of my own house,

00:07:02.482 --> 00:07:05.761
but they're so cool. So there's definitely options out there.

00:07:05.762 --> 00:07:06.841
Keep looking. On marketplace,

00:07:06.842 --> 00:07:09.665
I grab mine for $200, and I fix it up, and it's great.
