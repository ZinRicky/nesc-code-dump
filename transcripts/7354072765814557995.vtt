00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
This might ruffle up some feathers,

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:04.661
but I truly believe to my core

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.042
that if a man is willing to buy

00:00:07.043 --> 00:00:10.321
 a woman an expensive gift, engagement ring.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:14.501
Then the woman should equally buy him an expensive gift.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.880
For example if he buys you an expensive engagement ring,

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:21.001
then you should buy him an expensive gift.

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:22.401
Maybe nice shoes, suit,

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:23.921
a classy watch.

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:26.401
Youâ€™re likely able to get him all of these things,

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:31.561
and it probably still won't be as expensive as a ring is these days.

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.279
I don't know, what do you guys think?
