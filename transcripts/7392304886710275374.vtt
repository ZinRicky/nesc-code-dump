00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.840
I just had somebody ask me the most phenomenal question,

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.241
and I wanted to bring it to y'all

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:06.501
because I would love to know what your answer is.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.400
Someone just asked me if I could go back in time,

00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:09.761
if I would get married again,

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:12.121
and my answer is an immediate yes.

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:14.201
If I could go back in time and married my husband again,

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:16.241
I would marry him a thousand times over.

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:18.481
But we've had the discourse on this app of,

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:20.781
if something happened to your husband,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.360
would you get married again?

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:23.561
This is not that question.

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:25.601
I wanna know, if you could go back in time,

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:27.041
would you get married again?

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:29.621
Because the person who asked me said that they would not.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.960
But hindsight is 20 20 in a lot of cases.

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:34.721
And I am just interested for those who say if they could go back,

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:35.521
they wouldn't get married,

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:37.701
what is stopping you from leaving now
