00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
I woke up craving Texas barbecue so bad,

00:03.161 --> 00:05.041
so obviously lucky took me.

00:05.042 --> 00:07.281
We've lived in Texas for a couple years now

00:07.282 --> 00:11.061
and for some reason this is only the second time that we're having it.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.040
Ended up going to Terry Blacks.

00:13.041 --> 00:16.441
I thought it wouldn't be busy since we got there right when it opened,

00:16.442 --> 00:18.901
but I was wrong. It was so busy.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.920
Started off getting all of our sides

00:20.921 --> 00:23.161
and then moved on to grabbing our meat.

00:23.162 --> 00:25.601
Lucky ended up getting two pounds of the brisket

00:25.602 --> 00:29.401
and I wanted some sausage so we ended up getting that as well.

00:29.402 --> 00:32.041
I was so confused by this box of bread.

00:32.042 --> 00:33.561
Someone please explain.

00:33.562 --> 00:36.921
We weren't too hungry since we're not big breakfast people,

00:36.922 --> 00:41.321
so we ended up getting we got some Mexican rice,

00:41.322 --> 00:43.101
green beans, beans,

00:43.120 --> 00:45.000
and then some pickles and onions.

00:45.001 --> 00:48.201
I've come around to green beans and these were so good.

00:48.202 --> 00:49.801
Before I could even start eating,

00:49.802 --> 00:51.721
lucky was already on his second plate

00:51.722 --> 00:54.121
and then also grabbed me some meat.

00:54.122 --> 00:57.921
Brisket was so tender and I loved having the pickles and onions

00:57.922 --> 01:00.081
as a palate cleanser in between.

01:00.082 --> 01:02.641
I feel like Mexican rice is so underrated.

01:02.642 --> 01:04.801
It's one of my favorite things to get.

01:04.802 --> 01:06.641
Have no clue what that soda was,

01:06.642 --> 01:09.921
but halfway through the meal I discovered that they had sauces

01:09.922 --> 01:12.521
so I tried them. I didn't think it needed any,

01:12.522 --> 01:14.321
but lucky disagreed with me.

01:14.322 --> 01:15.721
This point I tapped out.

01:15.722 --> 01:19.121
So lucky finished off almost All of our meat and our sides.

01:19.122 --> 01:23.802
We cleared the table. And this was exactly what I wanted. It was so good.
