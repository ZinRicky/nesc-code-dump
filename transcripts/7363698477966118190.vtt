00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.240
then there's these doctors

00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:02.481
basically they take care of people

00:00:02.482 --> 00:00:04.281
and the female doctors are better

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:05.741
how do you know that they're better

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.580
because the people that they're treating are less likely to die

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.820
and they live longer

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.500
well I've said those doctors must get treated really well

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.740
no they get treated worse what

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:16.840
yeah okay

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:19.361
so female doctors are less likely to be promoted

00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:22.241
because they're more likely be discriminated against because they're women

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:23.721
if women doctors are better

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.121
why would it be bad to be

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:25.941
I know

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.920
okay so if they're better at their jobs and they get treated worse

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:31.181
they must get paid more

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.700
no I get paid the same

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.020
no what happens

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.440
like a lot less 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.280
should I go no no

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:50.381
don't go we have made so many advancements on women's health

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.780
and at least you're not paying those doctors less

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.340
because they're working on women
