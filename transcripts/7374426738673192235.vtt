Yuri Kuchiyama

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.760
an American civil rights activist

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:06.881
known for her collaboration with Malcolm X

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:09.381
and her work in Asian and black solidarity.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.820
Asian Americans must be more vocal,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.340
visible, and take stands on crucial issues.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.820
Hopefully, Asians will side with the most dispossessed,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.580
oppressed, and marginalized.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.980
Remembering our own history,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.140

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.200
ambiguous, accommodating,

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:37.241
uncomplaining college will people to a more wrestling

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:40.341
sensitive advocate for human worth,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.480
human rights, and human dignity.

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:44.986
