00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.480
I would never normally post this,

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.480
because so many people are going through a natural disaster right now,

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:07.761
I just wanna remind you that we don't need comments like this.

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.401
Just because your reality doesn't match someone else's

00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:12.401
doesn't mean it didn't happen.

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:17.221
And so here is your reminder that if you have nothing nice to say,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.400
just keep scrolling. We don't need to comment things like this

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.821
because it could be someone's worst nightmare.
