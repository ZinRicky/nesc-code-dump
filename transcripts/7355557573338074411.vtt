00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.560
Something I absolutely love about homeschooling

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:05.121
is that we are taking a mental health day today.

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:08.081
And we can do that whenever mom or kids need it.

00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:09.601
Because we've been traveling a lot.

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:13.801
We have been schlepping our kids around this goddamn country.

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:15.461
And not only am I tired,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.680
they're tired,

00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:17.521
they're exhausted,

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:18.501
they're cranky.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.240
And because we're homeschooling,

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:21.401
we can literally be like,

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:22.221
you know what?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.920
Not today. And before anyone comes at me in the comments,

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.561
this is not us being lazy.

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:30.921
That we are still getting all of our hundred eighty days of, like,

00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:33.241
required log school hours in.

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.161
We actually started homeschooling in June,

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:38.441
so we are actually ahead of where we're supposed to be for the year.

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:40.041
So I'm sitting my ass in bed,

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.321
they're playing with the giant Legos I just got them.

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:44.101
And we are all gonna decompress.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.220
Because if I hear one more argument between those children,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.504
it's gonna drive me nuts.
