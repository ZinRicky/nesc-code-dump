00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.580
I do not understand extroverts!

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.220
that energy is beyond me

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.040
you put me in a room around people I don't know?

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:14.241
there's an 80% chance that I'll become MUTE and I'll just turn into a baby turtle

00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:16.101
okay that does sound really bad

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.680
but I'm an introvert,

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:20.181
how do I teach myself how to be an extrovert?
