00:00.200 --> 00:03.520
My eczema has been flaring up so bad lately.

00:03.521 --> 00:05.241
I've not been taking care of myself.

00:05.242 --> 00:06.481
I've been really stressed,

00:06.482 --> 00:10.961
so my palms always tend to look a little bit rough.

00:10.962 --> 00:13.761
I take the C D S. 0 1 daily.

00:13.762 --> 00:16.961
Symbiotic you can take in this little travel container,

00:16.962 --> 00:20.121
which I do. I always do two pills in the mornings,

00:20.122 --> 00:22.601
and it's so good for my gut.

00:22.602 --> 00:25.601
Is a 24 strain probiotic blend.

00:25.602 --> 00:27.481
Helps me with feeling bloated.

00:27.482 --> 00:29.441
And every time that my skin gets bad,

00:29.442 --> 00:31.201
I look at my gut, what I'm eating,

00:31.202 --> 00:32.981
and what I'm putting into my body,

00:33.280 --> 00:37.040
and I see a massive difference when I use seed and when I don't.

00:37.041 --> 00:41.401
So if any of you guys want to try seed and you felt bloated,

00:41.402 --> 00:42.761
or your skin hasn't been great,

00:42.762 --> 00:44.881
or you just feel all around sluggish,

00:44.882 --> 00:46.641
a lot of the times, it's worth it

00:46.642 --> 00:50.132
looking at your gut and looking into taking a good probiotic.
