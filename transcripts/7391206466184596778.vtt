00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
Today's stove cleaning day on my 1950s chamber stove.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.680
I've been putting this off for a while.

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:06.721
So this is gonna be a deep clean.

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:08.161
I've been doing some touch up cleaning

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:10.121
but the last week I knew I was gonna deep clean it.

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:11.741
So I just been kinda letting it go.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.560
This is the broiler top. It kinda acts like a Blackstone.

00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:16.421
And here is the pilot light cover.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.720
I'm gonna remove my handy dandy childproofing for the pantry area here.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:25.481
And I did have a boil over of some chocolate syrup a few days ago.

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:27.541
So this is this disaster right here.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.800
It spilled through the drip hand and catch it

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:30.921
and it went all over the place.

00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:33.281
So we're gonna start from top to bottom.

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:36.201
I'm gonna take the grill crumb catcher out here.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.281
I'm gonna take the hot plate off.

00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:38.001
It does remove.

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:41.081
I'm gonna clean that and I'm gonna remove all the pieces that come off.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:44.181
Now I'm gonna shut the gas off and blow the pilot light out.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.920
I don't want the pilot light on as it's gonna keep getting warm

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.501
and I want it cool off where I'm cleaning everything.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.640
Now these are the daisy burners.

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:51.521
They easily remove

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:54.861
and I'm gonna take those out and give them a little bit of maintenance.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.160
The original enamel coating has started to deteriorate.

00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:00.321
Do you wanna get them recoded?

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:01.841
But that's something that I'm not gonna do right now.

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:02.721
So I'm gonna touch them up.

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:04.041
With some high heat paint

00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:06.521
to see if that will make them a little better.

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:08.241
I'm gonna put all the drip pans right now

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:10.781
into some soapy water to soak.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.960
As I have this more. That chocolate syrup disaster right here.

00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:15.441
This is the chocolate syrup again.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.981
I need to scrub all this off and remove it.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.760
Some of these spots are pretty stubborn.

00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:25.361
I'm using just dish soap and some baking soda

00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:28.701
to remove all the burnt on pieces on the chrome.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.280
Now the drawer for the bottom of the pantry does come out

00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.121
for the bottom piece. And so

00:01:40.122 --> 00:01:41.241
that makes it a little bit easier

00:01:41.242 --> 00:01:43.261
for me to get this chocolate syrup off.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.760
It did make a huge mess.

00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:48.221
I actually used a smaller pan than I normally would to make the syrup,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.800
as I didn't wanna dirty up a new pan.

00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:51.641
And it's actually made, obviously

00:01:51.642 --> 00:01:54.101
way more mess than it would have been just to use the beer pan.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.600
The designer, the stove

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:03.261
really makes me think that they actually spent a lot of time

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.560
when designing the stove

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.801
to think of all the things that you need to do

00:02:06.802 --> 00:02:08.261
to clean it and use it properly.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.959
Now I'm gonna wire brush the daisy burners

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.841
and get them a new coat of paint. Again.

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:14.761
Something I wanted to repair properly in the future,

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:16.401
but right now this is just a touch up.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.681
And then I'm gonna clean and scrub with a griddle plate.

00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:19.961
I'm not Gonna remove all of this

00:02:19.962 --> 00:02:24.241
because it does create a nice nonstick seasoning to it,

00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:27.201
but I do wanna make it look a little bit nicer and keep it clean.

00:02:27.202 --> 00:02:29.901
I don't want the seasoning to build up to the point where it's black.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.080
Now I'm going to reassemble the grill and close that,

00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:34.581
and that part is finished.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.680
And now I'm gonna reinstall the daisy burners.

00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:43.201
I only gave these a few minutes to dry.

00:02:43.202 --> 00:02:44.821
The paint dried really fast.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.680
This is the part where the gas comes through,

00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:50.241
and that's where you can adjust how much gas is flowing through,

00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:51.081
which is really important.

00:02:51.082 --> 00:02:52.801
If you have propane or natural gas,

00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:54.121
you can literally just.

00:02:54.122 --> 00:02:56.421
That's how you adjust the difference between the two.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.200
And I'm gonna replace the drip pans.

00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:01.361
They are super weird to reinstall.

00:03:01.362 --> 00:03:02.041
They have, like,

00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:03.281
a certain pattern that goes to them,

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:06.261
and sometimes they can be kind of annoying to put back in.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.220
Like, it's not set up to put back in very obviously.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.200
And I'm gonna get the front of the stove and wipe down

00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:13.761
and the floor. Anything goes for these, um,

00:03:13.762 --> 00:03:15.681
burner covers. I think that's what they're called.

00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:18.481
Um, they have a certain pin system to them,

00:03:18.482 --> 00:03:23.161
a pattern. So the longer pins hook into the holes to hold them in place,

00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:24.881
but it's not very obvious which way they go.

00:03:24.882 --> 00:03:25.941
And it's kind of a.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.940
Kind of a waste of time sitting there trying to figure that Out.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.880
Now all I need to do is relight the pilot light.

00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:32.601
I only use one pilot light on the stove.

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:34.761
There is three, but I just use the one.

00:03:34.762 --> 00:03:36.561
And I'm gonna be cooking some lunch,

00:03:36.562 --> 00:03:38.181
so time to make it dirty again.
