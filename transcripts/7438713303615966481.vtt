00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.228
the coping for our pool renovation project 

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:03.160
just about ended me

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:03.960
and if I had known

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:05.508
I was gonna spend more than 20 hours 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:06.680
sitting on the hard concrete

00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:08.518
working on it I might have reconsided 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.680
all of my life decisions

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:10.800
but ignorance as they say

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.469
is bliss and at this point I'm about 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.597
as ignorant as they come 

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:15.203
so I got to work mixing up my mortar 

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:16.680
and piping it in between my bricks

00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:17.626
the aim of the game here 

00:00:17.627 --> 00:00:18.800
is to fix up some of the bricks

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:20.280
where the mortar is cracked or missing

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.956
and it was surprisingly a lot like 

00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:23.632
decorating a fluffy vanilla sponge 

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:25.120
you know.. terrifying

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:26.160
after the mortar had set

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:27.798
It was time for me to try and make the bricks 

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:30.040
look like anything other than what they currently look like

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:30.735
And Iâ€™ll tell ya 

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:32.126
deciding on the best approach 

00:00:32.127 --> 00:00:33.240
to take with this coping

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.357
has been nothing short of 

00:00:34.358 --> 00:00:35.560
an absolute fkn nightmare

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:37.200
we had a bunch of spare bricks out back

00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:38.903
so we tested out a lot of different ways 

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:40.313
that we might be able to give this 

00:00:40.314 --> 00:00:41.120
a bit of a face lift

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:42.468
cause unfortunately 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:43.480
or fortunately 

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:44.560
depending on how you look at it

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:45.720
the coping is here to stay

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.440
been told it's basically impossible to swap it out for anything

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.355
and one thing about me is I do love the 

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:51.600
heritage that this home has

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:52.960
we settled on a lime wash paint

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:53.880
and while I got to work

00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:56.603
starting that, Mark was painstakingly cutting 

00:00:56.604 --> 00:00:58.320
and shaping hundreds of tiles

00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:00.585
I said it in the last part and I'll say it again 

00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:01.880
that spa has been a headache

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:02.640
on our test bricks

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:06.080
we also tried out a micro cement and also like a concrete paint

00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:07.967
and I liked the finished look because these 

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.040
bricks are pretty beat up

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:10.520
but it also made me quite worried

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:12.600
cause essentially it would just cover the bricks

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.040
and I kinda wanna make them work

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:16.280
but also most of my decisions are subject to change

00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:19.080
so today I'm just testing this out and seeing I like it 

00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:20.560
Okay undercoats always look a bit like shit

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:22.089
so don't judge me but I think I like the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.320
direction that this is heading in

00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:25.520
I'm gonna quickly paint it again and crack on with the grouting

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:27.072
so I'm so sorry but you need to come 

00:01:27.073 --> 00:01:27.870
back for the update
