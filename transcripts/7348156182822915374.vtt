00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.520
I was so nervous when I started dating this guy that I like

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:05.241
we've been dating now for over a year

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:08.041
I was so nervous when I started dating him because he had four kids

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:09.161
like he was fine with it

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:09.641
but then I was like

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:09.961
oh my god

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:12.241
what about when he still tells his family

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:13.201
what if they're like

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:13.761
oh my god

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:14.481
you're crazy like

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:15.121
what are you doing

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:15.641
blah blah blah

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:18.181
like some of the shit you do hear people say about single moms

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.580
um

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.900
his mom just sent my kids

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.040
each one of my children

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:25.061
all four of them

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.420
a little Easter card with $10 inside for all of them

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.820
so needless to say

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.440
it is not the end of the world to leave your marriage and start over

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:42.301
because there are lots of beautiful people in this world that

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.320
you know

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:47.121
see you for more than a single mom and see your children as more than a burden

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:49.881
and they're willing to welcome you and love you

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:52.941
and that's way better than being in a toxic marriage
