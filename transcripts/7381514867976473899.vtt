00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.200
as a mother of three

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.020
let me tell you why I absolutely love this parallel toy

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.400
firstly look at the terrain this thing covers grass

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:08.960
dirt sand gravel

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:11.480
we tested it on everything and it did not struggle

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:13.580
this is true four wheel drive

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.280
this is actually remote controls

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:16.960
the parent have full control of a baby

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:19.020
it even has a Bluetooth radio

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.600
so you can play your own music or the music that comes of it

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:22.920
and my son like that part

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:26.740
it actually has spring suspension so no harsh bumps

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.320
it has this cute little storage area

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:30.840
that my son likes to bring his snacks and teddy bears in

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.600
the bar lights actually do light up

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.440
and they're really bright LED lights

00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:35.920
and so does the head lamps in the front

00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:37.820
so you can definitely use this in the evenings

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.960
this Jeep had no problem in all the terrains on our farm

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:42.320
my other children also had fun

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:44.600
they were 4 and 7 and they also love to drive it

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:46.560
it can be driven by the steering wheel as well

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:50.920
it also had great suspension and had no issues going over these poles right here

00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:52.120
my son absolutely loved it

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:53.460
and your kids are gonna love it too
