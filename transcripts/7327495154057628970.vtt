00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.460
okay so Ryan Gosling just put out a statement

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.800
addressing the fact that he got a nomination in Barbie did it

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:06.761
when I tell you that

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:09.761
like I knew that Ryan Gosling was going to do this and I'm

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:11.021
like emotional

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.240
so in a statement

00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:14.801
he says that while he's honoured to be nominated

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:16.521
there is no Ken without Barbie

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:19.561
and there is no Barbie without Greta Gerwick and Margot Robbie

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:22.481
so what he's doing here is acknowledging the female labour

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:23.921
that is rendered invisible

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:28.841
but that was necessary for him to even be nominated for an Oscar today

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:30.861
and the reason why this makes me emotional

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.760
is that it is so rare for men to acknowledge the female labour that is required

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:41.521
for them to receive the accolades and the praise

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:45.801
that they disproportionately receive as men in a patriarchal world

00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:46.641
this is a man who

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:47.881
more than a decade ago

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:51.881
who called out Hollywood for giving an R rating to Blue Valentine

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:53.041
his movie with Michelle Williams

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:55.161
because she was receiving oral segggs in the scene

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:57.087
this man is my Roman Empire
