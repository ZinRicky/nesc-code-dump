00:00.000 --> 00:01.440
I couldn't sleep last night

00:01.441 --> 00:04.561
and realized that I had a head of Napa cabbage in the fridge

00:04.562 --> 00:06.521
and hadn't made kimchi in a while.

00:06.522 --> 00:09.561
So I decided to go downstairs and do exactly that.

00:09.562 --> 00:11.401
I cut my cabbage into quarters

00:11.402 --> 00:15.581
and took the core out before slicing it into smaller pieces,

00:15.640 --> 00:19.080
repeated that with each quarter and put them in a large bowl,

00:19.081 --> 00:21.761
sprinkle them with salt, massage my cabbage,

00:21.762 --> 00:23.601
and then topped it with water.

00:23.602 --> 00:26.561
I put a plate on top to make it a little heavier

00:26.562 --> 00:29.201
and then let that sit for about two hours.

00:29.202 --> 00:30.641
After about two hours,

00:30.642 --> 00:34.401
I poured all that water out and rinsed it a couple times

00:34.402 --> 00:36.801
before letting it sit in my strainer

00:36.802 --> 00:40.441
while I prep my marinade. I grated some garlic, ginger,

00:40.442 --> 00:43.221
put that back in the bowl with some fish sauce,

00:43.240 --> 00:48.100
sprinkle of sugar, and some red chili flakes for giving that a good mix.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.360
While that was sitting and getting to know each other,

00:50.361 --> 00:53.841
I peeled my daikon radish and sliced it into matchsticks

00:53.842 --> 00:57.281
before moving on to cutting up some spring onions.

00:57.282 --> 00:58.881
Once all my prep was done,

00:58.882 --> 01:02.661
I put all of my vegetables into my large bowl,

01:02.720 --> 01:04.840
started mixing that really well,

01:04.841 --> 01:07.681
making sure to get everything coated evenly.

01:07.682 --> 01:09.961
I then started filling it into my jar.

01:09.962 --> 01:13.481
I had to try a little bit just to make sure it was perfect.

01:13.482 --> 01:14.761
Then I screwed the lid on

01:14.762 --> 01:18.341
and let it stand for four days at room temperature. To ferment
