00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.480
This week is Sourdough Week

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:02.521
and I'm gonna be sharing with you

00:00:02.522 --> 00:00:04.421
some of my favourite sourdough recipes,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.220
starting off with this simple sourdough bread.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.160
I actually had a sourdough starter for years

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:10.361
before I actually made bread.

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:12.081
I'd use it for cooking and other things,

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:14.281
and I always was so daunted with bread.

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:16.281
But I finally started making this recipe

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.401
and it is the easiest sourdough bread recipe I found,

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:20.681
and it works every single time.

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:22.381
I've never had an issue with this recipe.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.760
I don't know if it's the oven or the Dutch oven that I use,

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:28.361
but the bread always comes out with a nice soft crust.

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:31.081
It's not too hard. I've made some other recipes before

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:32.441
where the crust just came out really hard,

00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:34.421
and my kids and my husband don't like that.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.680
I'm gonna leave the recipe below.

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:37.921
But it's such a simple recipe.

00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:39.461
It's flour, water,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.240
sourdough starter and salt.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.961
I start my bread in the evenings

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:46.681
and then I do my stretches and folds as the kids are taking a bath

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:47.721
and as we're winding down

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:49.221
ready to get ready for bed.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.400
Once I'm done with my 3 to 4 stretch and fold,

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:53.101
sometimes I only get two in.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.260
I'm gonna do a wet hand so my hands don't stick to the dough.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.960
Once I'm done with my stretching folds,

00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.521
I'll let it sit on the counter overnight

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:00.721
and then in the morning

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:03.521
I will shape the bread and put it into balancing Baskets,

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:05.881
or whatever basket or bowl that I have.

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:09.121
When I first started out, I didn't use fancy balancing baskets.

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:10.441
I just use little bowls.

00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:13.721
And I even found some little baskets at the target,

00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:15.161
like, $1 section at the front,

00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:16.701
and I use those for a few years.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
I always do my dough in batches of two loaves or four loaves.

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.641
So first I'm gonna cut the dough

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:26.161
into the amount of loaves I'm planning to make.

00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:27.081
And then I'm gonna shape it.

00:01:27.082 --> 00:01:28.581
I'm gonna first lay it out flat,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.280
fold it in half, and roll it up,

00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:33.441
up on itself. And then I'm gonna create tension on the top of the dough

00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:36.541
by sliding and pulling the dough towards me.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.540
My son does not having this part.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.720
Then I'm gonna lightly dust the balance in baskets.

00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:41.641
If I'm using a bowl,

00:01:41.642 --> 00:01:45.201
I'd just put a tea towel in the basket instead of this cloth.

00:01:45.202 --> 00:01:46.721
Once the loaves are in the baskets,

00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:48.321
they're gonna rise for one more time.

00:01:48.322 --> 00:01:49.561
You can either do this on the counter

00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:51.981
if you wanna cook the bread over the next hour or two,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.440
or you can put it this in the fridge.

00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:55.201
And they will last in there for a few days.

00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:57.081
So if you wanna put a pause on baking bread

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:59.521
and have them ready before dinner time at another date,

00:01:59.522 --> 00:02:00.801
you can just pop them in the fridge.

00:02:00.802 --> 00:02:03.001
I cover mine with the beeswax paper here.

00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:04.721
Or you can use shower Caps,

00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:08.201
plastic bags, anything to stop the dough from drying out.

00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:10.781
I'm gonna leave the bacon instructions down with the recipe.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.820
Happy baking
