00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.840
we bought this beautiful big sofa from Farmers recently

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.560
and it is legitimately my dream couch

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:06.720
it's called the Aspen and it's a modular sofa

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.440
so you can get different pieces and configure it however you like

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:11.960
and lately I've been on a bit of a mission to say the least

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:13.160
to overhaul this space

00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:16.720
and today I'm adding some personality with some new cushions from Farmers 

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:18.440
and right off the lounge is my dining room

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:20.840
and these shelves have just been crying out for attention

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:21.840
so when I was at Farmers

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.720
I picked up a few cute decor pieces to help tie it all together 

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:26.160
this is the room that we painted green

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.280
if you caught that Reno so I've used that tone within the decor pieces

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:31.800
because it tones really nicely with the mid-century wood

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:33.560
Iâ€™m really happy with how the shelves came

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:35.511
but my favourite find was the marble chess set 

00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:36.840
because we're a big games family

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:39.136
so I can just see us sit around after dinner and playing

00:00:39.137 --> 00:00:40.120
 back in the lounge room

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:41.480
it's time for the finishing touches

00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:43.800
and I can never resist a cute lamp for the ambiance 

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.960
and I'm starting to think that maybe this room might finally be done

00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:48.600
and if you've watched the progression of this room

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:50.280
you will know what a momentous occasion that is

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:52.440
it's feeling layered cosy and cohesive

00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:54.120
and the cushions really helped with that

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.760
all of these items are Farmers brand M&Co

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.942
 and I just know that they're quality to love for years to come
