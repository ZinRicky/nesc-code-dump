00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.040
OC is a national security threat

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.840
due to its parent companies ties to the Chinese Communist Party

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.980
and how user data is stored.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.440
The house passed a bipartisan Bill

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.440
that would require the popular app to be

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.520
sold by its Chinese parent company

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.020
or be banned on American devices.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.280
This is Alia James.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.720
Spoke to local content creators

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.820
about what this band would mean to them.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.440
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pushing for a Bill

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.360
that could be on the popular social media app TikTok.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.120
And I spoke with many influencers,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.740
and they told me that this could be a hard hit for the economy.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.240
Content creators here in the Low Country

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.200
are pushing back against recent efforts by lawmakers

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.440
to be on TikTok,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.900
a popular social media app where users can share videos.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.440
I think it's silly, in my opinion.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.800
I think TikTok is given something to people

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.220
in the way that social media maybe originally was supposed to be.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.920
The concerns are centered around the app's parent company, ByteDance,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.620
and it ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.440
Lawmakers say

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.020
the Chinese government could collect user data from American users,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.240
making it a national security threat.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.180
I can understand why.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.060
I guess the powers that be in government don't like the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.320
amount of person to person information sharing,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.640
but that's also why the people love it.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.140
You know, we've gotten to a point where we can't really, um,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.280
trust all of the things that are being said to us.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.340
But what I can trust is someone's POV.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.220
What I can trust is someone's heartfelt, lived experience.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.280
While creators on the app understand the security concerns,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.040
they're urging lawmakers to consider the negative impact

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.940
that banning TikTok would have on small businesses and influencers,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.800
many of whom consider it a main source of income.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.520
A lot of us get our revenue,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.120
you know, our money income from the platform.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.740
Being able to have a platform on TikTok and itself is a blessing.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.120
But when it comes to the whole actuality of it all,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.840
we have to remember that content creators

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.400
make money through their content

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.060
because you have brands that are looking at them.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.060
Most of South Carolina representatives voted to support the Bill.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.520
The Bill now heads to the Senate,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.420
where it faces an uncertain fate.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.640
Reporting him out. Pleasant.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.980
I'm Delilah James. Count on two.
