00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.700
let me tell you a story about my boyfriend and this broken lamp

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.800
a little backstory

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.001
I have four children

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.081
and I love crows

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:09.221
I got a crow tattoo

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.480
I have a bunny tattoo

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:13.321
like I just love birds and animals and outdoors and all that

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:15.241
and so when I saw this lamp on the TikTok shop

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:16.081
I was like oh

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.121
my god I would not shut up about it

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:20.761
pretty sure I bought it with my own actual money

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:21.281
I was like no

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:22.401
I love this fucking lamp

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:23.921
I'm so excited to get this fucking lip

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:25.821
I wouldn't shut up about the fucking lamp

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.120
and then I got the lamp

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:29.121
and I was so excited when I got the fucking lamp

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.321
I set it up on my

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:31.601
my kitchen table

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:32.001
and I was like

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:32.961
look at how cool it is

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:33.681
because the thing is

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:36.641
the crow is holding the electrical cord

00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:39.281
holding the light bulb up for you to see in its mouth

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:39.761
and it just like

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:41.061
looks really cool

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.140
and it's like a really good um

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.880
way to kinda not have the cord be a mess

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.801
like the cord is a part of the art

00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:50.561
so it's not I don't know

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:52.021
I just love the lamp

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.860
and I would not shut up about the lamp

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.720
he was here when it broke and saw my face

00:00:58.721 --> 00:00:59.481
was like ah I

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:02.341
I mean I had had the lamp for like

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.140
an hour before it broke

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.220
he bought me another one

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.900
it's the coolest fucking lamp

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.580
this is the crow

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.640
he just knew how excited I was about the fucking lamp

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:16.121
he was like not on my watch

00:01:16.122 --> 00:01:18.581
god damn it I'll get you another fucking lamp

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.860
okay but look

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.180
the crow holds

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.180
shut up

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.700
see isn't that cool

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.980
a really cool lamp

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.320
like he's bringing you the light

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:35.381
I don't know I just fucking love it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.620
and I know don't let it fall
