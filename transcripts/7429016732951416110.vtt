00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.440
One of our country's founding principles was by the people,

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:03.001
for the people.

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.881
But it really has not been for the people for quite some time

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:06.881
in the last couple of years.

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:08.761
Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:10.121
and anything extra

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:12.501
is just gonna break the backs of hard working Americans.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.600
As a Christian, I am incredibly worried about this election.

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:15.721
A Harris administration

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:18.641
would mean a lot of negative things for the Christian community.

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:21.721
And this is why Christians cannot sit this election out.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.001
As opting out as opting in to something.

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.241
This is why it is so important to vote.

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:30.401
More specifically voting early in person at your local county office.

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:30.961
Early voting

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:33.361
gives you the convenience of doing it on your own schedule

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:35.641
instead of on one specific day of the year

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:37.481
in case something would to rise or come up.

00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:39.521
Also ensures that your vote is secure

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.081
and not gonna be tampered with in the mail

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.241
or lost in the mail or any of those types of things.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:46.001
It helps reduce the stress on election pull workers

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.601
and helps you minimize human error.

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:50.921
Your vote matters in which direction this country is gonna go.

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:53.141
You cannot opt out this election.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.120
So early voting helps you keep your vote secure and safe

00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:59.491
and make sure it is counted. So get to the polls.
