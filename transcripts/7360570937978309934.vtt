00:00.920 --> 00:02.720
I don't have much of a voice right now

00:02.721 --> 00:04.481
cause I'm kind of losing my voice,

00:04.482 --> 00:07.661
but I wanted to give you all a Sunday recap.

00:08.080 --> 00:10.600
So this morning started out normal.

00:10.601 --> 00:11.681
We did chores,

00:11.682 --> 00:13.301
the boys milked the cows.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.580
We came inside the house and got ready for church.

00:17.160 --> 00:20.080
We were on our way to church and realize that Dottie R.

00:20.081 --> 00:22.341
Heifer was going into labor.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.960
She actually delivered a beautiful female calf,

00:25.961 --> 00:28.261
but unfortunately, it was a stillborn,

00:28.560 --> 00:31.060
which was so disappointing.

00:31.600 --> 00:32.680
After church, though,

00:32.681 --> 00:35.601
we started milking her.

00:35.602 --> 00:38.621
I got most of the colostrum out.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.400
She did really well for never being milked before.

00:41.401 --> 00:43.441
This is a heifer,

00:43.442 --> 00:45.281
so she's never had a calf before.

00:45.282 --> 00:47.061
This is her first time being milked.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.240
Then we went down to my mom's house in the yard. Looked so beautiful.

00:52.241 --> 00:53.901
We had dinner outside,

00:54.240 --> 00:58.020
and then I went inside the shop because we have a little

00:59.760 --> 01:02.760
spot in the shop now that we're selling some ballerina farm goods.

01:02.761 --> 01:06.821
We brought down sourdough kids and candles

01:07.480 --> 01:12.000
and all our wooden utensils and honey and seasoning and dish soap,

01:12.001 --> 01:13.661
granola, all of it.

01:13.760 --> 01:14.480
And then this week,

01:14.481 --> 01:18.961
we're also gonna be adding some meat and croissants down there

01:18.962 --> 01:20.601
as well, which is just so exciting.

01:20.602 --> 01:21.741
So if you're local,

01:21.760 --> 01:24.180
come by the flower shop because there's lots of goodies.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.680
And then we just stayed and hang.

01:27.681 --> 01:30.241
Hung out with cousins and spend time with family.

01:30.242 --> 01:34.697
And then we raced home and milk daddy Again for her evening, Milky
