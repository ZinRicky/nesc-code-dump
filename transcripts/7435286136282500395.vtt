00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
I'm a tribe wife. I got married at 18.

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:03.201
My husband is the main breadwinner

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.761
and I'm pregnant with our first child.

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:06.561
What would I do if my husband were to die?

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:07.761
I've been asked this question a lot

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.161
and I thought it was high time I made an in depth series on it.

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:13.381
So welcome to the third part of my Emergency Protocol series.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.720
Today I'm gonna walk you through exactly what I would do

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.341
if my husband were to die.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.720
First, our families,

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.241
his and mine,

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:21.781
would come and help me sort out the funeral and the burial.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.920
Some family would probably stay to help me with childcare.

00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:27.301
Packing up my life here. I would sell the house,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.040
this truck, most of our belongings.

00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.401
Do something like an estate sale

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:31.681
and I would move in with my family

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:33.281
and put myself under my father's roof.

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:35.601
My family has a guest house and campers,

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.961
so I would have my own house on their property.

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:41.241
My parents and grandparents both live there,

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:42.501
so they would help with Jane

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.200
and it wouldn't be hard for me to continue to work while raising her.

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:47.081
I'm already making a full time income on social media.

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:49.921
But if that were not to work out for some reason,

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:51.901
I would probably go back to wedding photography.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.120
However, I don't really see myself as having a lot of financial needs

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.761
because my family has already offered to provide for me financially.

00:00:57.762 --> 00:00:59.101
If my husband were to Die.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.160
And then as life goes on, I would be homeschooling our daughter Jane

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:04.801
and get involved in local church.

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:07.141
And eventually, I definitely do see myself remarrying.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.400
Living the rest of my life alone

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:12.041
is not something that I have everyone to do.

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:14.641
So while it's something that's very hard to think about,

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:15.961
if my husband were to die,

00:01:15.962 --> 00:01:17.961
I would like to get married again in the future

00:01:17.962 --> 00:01:20.281
and have that father figure for our daughter

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:23.061
and have that companionship that marriage has to offer.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.880
Let me know in the comments if you have any questions

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:26.442
to continue the series with.
