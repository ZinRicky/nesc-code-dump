00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.400
okay so imagine this

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.800
like alternate universe

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.480
and in this alternate universe

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:08.337
weÂ haveÂ neverÂ hadÂ aÂ maleÂ president!!Â ðŸ¤¯

00:00:08.338 --> 00:00:08.980
 right

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.080
all 45 women. not a single man.

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:16.100
finally we start having some male nominees right

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.840
if that was the case

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:23.300
the most unhinged possible thing women could start saying would be

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.300
â€¦.you really shouldn't vote for somebody just based off their gender

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.480
but in this universe where that is happening

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:34.640
that's literally what they're saying to us

00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:35.880
like that's again

00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:37.760
that's the most unhinged possible

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:39.780
stupid thing you could possibly say

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.200
like are you sure you're the person who gets to be lecturing on that

00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:49.600
who not only only voted for men for being men

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:53.580
but you also only allowed men to vote

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.160
and your god is a man and he had a son

00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:00.300
and his son had 12 male best friends

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.960
but yeah

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:01.640
you should like

00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:04.819
really not just follow people for their genders
