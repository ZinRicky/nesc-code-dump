00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.140
I ditched the USA 

00:00:01.141 --> 00:00:02.791
to go to this biohacking retreat 

00:00:02.792 --> 00:00:04.761
in Sayulita, Mexico for one week

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:07.001
and on our first day we sat in Temazcal

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.921
a traditional Mexican sweat lodge

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:11.455
it was treated like a psychedelic experience 

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:13.201
facilitated by a Mexican native

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:14.504
the whole retreat felt 

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:15.921
like a ceremony in itself

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.235
a container where I was able 

00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:18.641
to meet other like minded women

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:19.841
unlike anywhere else

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:21.033
and this time I was able 

00:00:21.034 --> 00:00:22.321
to bring my favourite human

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.881
during this week long adventure 

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:25.441
I kept saying to myself you know

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:26.617
you're lucky if you meet 

00:00:26.618 --> 00:00:27.887
even one incredible person 

00:00:27.888 --> 00:00:28.641
every five years

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:29.821
and that's if you're lucky

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.720
but in this case

00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:32.114
it's like meeting a lifetime 

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.507
of your brothers and sisters 

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:34.421
from previous lives

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.360
because everyone is already vetted

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:37.371
everyone already knows 

00:00:37.372 --> 00:00:38.601
what's going on in the world

00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:40.002
and everyone's health is their 

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:40.861
number one priority

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.077
most of these people also 

00:00:42.078 --> 00:00:43.681
heal themselves from chronic illness

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:45.581
because the medical system failed them

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.513
at one point most of these people 

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:48.561
were probably vegan

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:50.236
the main things we all have in common 

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:51.515
is the entrepreneurial drive 

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:52.001
for freedom

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:53.215
and the desire to have more 

00:00:53.216 --> 00:00:54.561
like minded people in our lives

00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:55.806
and this retreat was the 

00:00:55.807 --> 00:00:57.599
perfect container to facilitate that
