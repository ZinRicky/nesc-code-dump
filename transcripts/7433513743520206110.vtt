00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
James Sexton, one of the top divorce lawyers in New York City,

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:06.601
one of the most famous divorce lawyers here on TikTok,

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:08.721
has a video going outrageously viral,

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:12.441
almost 27 million views, where he starts out crying, saying,

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:14.901
she's gonna lose because she's poor.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.320
She's gonna lose because she's poor,

00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:18.081
because she doesn't have appropriate representation.

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:21.901
And he tells the story of how he's representing the father.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.400
The mother is represented by a very young attorney,

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:27.401
one that's probably much more affordable or potentially pro Bono.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:31.641
And because this young attorney doesn't know the proper terminology

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:32.761
to get something admitted,

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:36.281
because the court. Once you've spent some time in any court,

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:37.561
be it criminal, family,

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:40.441
anything, once you've spent any time understanding the law

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:43.941
and experiencing the law with your life,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.960
you realize it is truly a game of semantics.

00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:51.281
It's a game of technicalities.

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:55.601
It's not truly justice. It's not truly what's right and fair.

00:00:55.602 --> 00:01:00.001
That is so idealistic and baby faced

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.401
to think that any court system goes that way.

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:05.261
So all his fucking tears are crocodile tears.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.480
Did he profit from that win?

00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:09.241
Yeah. At any point,

00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:12.201
he could have stopped it and stopped the fucking game

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:14.561
and done something to change the system.

00:01:14.562 --> 00:01:16.361
If he can see how broken it is,

00:01:16.362 --> 00:01:18.321
and he has that much power and influence,

00:01:18.322 --> 00:01:21.001
he could absolutely do something to make change.

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.321
Talking on TikTok just gets him notoriety,

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:27.041
just gets him more fame, just gets him more clients.

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:28.801
But he still playing The fucking game.

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:30.841
He still collecting the fucking checks,

00:01:30.842 --> 00:01:33.081
he's still wearing the slick fucking suits

00:01:33.082 --> 00:01:36.281
while single mothers are out here still fucking struggling

00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:38.001
cause they can't pay for an attorney.

00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:39.841
So Mister Fucking Sexton,

00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:43.381
save your fucking crocodile tears and shove them up your.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.180
Use them to wipe your own ass.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840
Because nobody gives a fuck that you're crying

00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.761
while you're still collecting the fucking paychecks

00:01:53.762 --> 00:01:58.601
and participating in the corruption of the family court.

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:01.361
No one should be put in the fucking position

00:02:01.362 --> 00:02:04.601
that their families being ripped apart because of money

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:08.001
and you're fully fucking participating and benefiting from it.

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.401
Don't you dare fucking come on here and cry

00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:11.961
and act like you're a fucking

00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:14.141
so sorry or like a fucking victim.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.413
Do something about it!
