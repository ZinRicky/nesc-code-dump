00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.920
Wow. I hate how our society has brainwashed women

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:06.181
into saying crap like this.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.360
Staying home with your children is not always a privilege.

00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:12.681
If you read my comments, you will see how many women say,

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:16.601
I struggled my butt off, but I was able to stay home with my children.

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.701
I just made the necessary sacrifices.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.080
I understand not everybody can do that, honey.

00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.881
But let me tell you, if I could divulge every secret

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:27.961
and every sacrifice my husband and I made

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:30.301
so that I could stay home with my first born,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.500
you would be shocked. I won't get into the nitty gritty details.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.220
Diddy be Diddy. I digress.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.740
We lived in the smallest home.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.520
I co slept with my baby. It was one bedroom.

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:47.561
I had one bathroom. I couldn't even go in there to use the bathroom

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:48.841
when my child was sleeping.

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:50.461
So I used alternative measure.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.000
We didn't go on vacations.

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:53.321
I stopped getting my hair done.

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:56.001
I stopped doing my nail. I clipped coupons.

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:59.521
My husband shot an Elk, which we lived off for the last year and a half.

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:01.801
I had small side hustles I did on the side

00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:04.441
just so I could have a little extra money for baby toys,

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:07.681
whatever we needed. We got every single ounce of clothing

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:10.401
that my child has had since the beginning of his life

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:13.401
from a very common thrift store here in Texas called Just Between

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:14.881
Friends. Were beautiful,

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:18.761
well loved clothes. And my son Never looked untaken care of.

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:21.321
I breastfed as much as I could

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:25.441
because people have no idea the cost of daycare

00:01:25.442 --> 00:01:27.381
and not breastfeeding your own child.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.880
When I did try to go to work,

00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:32.521
all I ended up doing was paying to go to work because I.

00:01:32.522 --> 00:01:34.041
To pay my niece to come over.

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:36.761
And then I would run from the office as much as I could

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:37.721
just to be with him.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:40.361
And I would try not to leave him for longer than two hours at a time

00:01:40.362 --> 00:01:42.401
because I didn't even know all this information.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.921
It just felt wrong in my gut.

00:01:43.922 --> 00:01:45.241
But do not sit here and say

00:01:45.242 --> 00:01:48.721
it is a pleasure or a luxury for most people.

00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:49.601
Sorry. Not a pleasure,

00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:52.061
a privilege. Mom brain.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.800
Plus the amount of stress and pressure that my husband had to provide,

00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:57.561
which, by the Grace of god,

00:01:57.562 --> 00:01:59.921
we are doing so amazing right now.

00:01:59.922 --> 00:02:03.241
I don't regret any moment or any sacrifice

00:02:03.242 --> 00:02:04.681
or any coupon clipped

00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:08.321
that I had to do in order to make sure I stayed with my baby,

00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:12.101
because it is the smallest chapter in their entire lives.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.500
And as far as your guilt, I am so sorry that you feel guilty.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.440
But what I have Learned, even from my own personal experience,

00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:22.561
is that guilt and shame is your internal compass saying

00:02:22.562 --> 00:02:24.721
maybe something was off. Now,

00:02:24.722 --> 00:02:26.721
there are some women that have no husbands,

00:02:26.722 --> 00:02:30.141
no father in the picture, no ability to work from Home,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.180
no educational background,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.760
no family that they live with.

00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:34.161
Um,

00:02:34.162 --> 00:02:37.561
a lot of military families that I'm familiar with here are like that

00:02:37.562 --> 00:02:38.961
because they have no family here.

00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:40.481
But at the end of the day,

00:02:40.482 --> 00:02:42.661
I will not stop sharing this information

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.940
because it makes some people uncomfortable.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.680
Because, like I said before,

00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:49.401
if I can spare a mama

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:52.521
whose gut is telling her to stay home and make the sacrifices,

00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:54.321
because it's not always a privilege,

00:02:54.322 --> 00:02:58.801
as you state, I'm going to keep speaking for the betterment of her,

00:02:58.802 --> 00:03:01.241
her children, and our society.

00:03:01.242 --> 00:03:03.721
Because if you're wondering how we got here,

00:03:03.722 --> 00:03:08.201
it's because we have had generations that started us with this.

00:03:08.202 --> 00:03:09.401
Starting at the baby boomers,

00:03:09.402 --> 00:03:10.841
with mothers leaving us at home,

00:03:10.842 --> 00:03:13.401
going to work. We divided the nuclear family.

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:15.501
We taught women that men are trash.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.880
Women are taught to go work for big corporate companies,

00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:23.321
also run by men, and that sacrifices do not need to happen

00:03:23.322 --> 00:03:26.421
in order to rear their children the way they need to.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.600
I felt guilty, too,

00:03:27.601 --> 00:03:29.281
babe, after my first kid,

00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:31.901
and I still did as much as I could to be with him.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.240
That is why I speak on this,

00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:41.641
because nobody understands how detrimental our culture has made it

00:03:41.642 --> 00:03:44.121
for stay at home moms, for women in general,

00:03:44.122 --> 00:03:45.861
for mothers, for children,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.480
dropping them off to the government,

00:03:47.481 --> 00:03:50.201
paying daycare workers to take care of our children.

00:03:50.202 --> 00:03:55.281
Because I know some women who literally don't

00:03:55.282 --> 00:03:56.641
Wanna stop going on vacation.

00:03:56.642 --> 00:03:58.681
They don't wanna stop getting their hair and nails done.

00:03:58.682 --> 00:03:59.881
They don't wanna clip coupons.

00:03:59.882 --> 00:04:01.901
They wanna shop at the most expensive stores.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.140
And they will work so they can afford those luxuries

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.920
and choose not to stay with home with their children.

00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:08.281
So, no,

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:13.001
I'm not shaming anyone. I am just giving information so that we know.

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:16.441
Because our life here in America is about informed consent.

00:04:16.442 --> 00:04:18.281
And we have not been informed on this.

00:04:18.282 --> 00:04:21.621
In fact, there's a lot of bogus studies saying quite the opposite.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.600
So, no,

00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:24.961
I will talk about this. God,

00:04:24.962 --> 00:04:30.781
if people just knew some of the crazy stuff I did to stay at home,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.340
you would never, ever say that I was privileged.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.600
But last thing I will say is

00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:43.141
I was blessed enough and smart enough to pick a really good man

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.040
who supported us through all of it.

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:49.221
But like most people say, you need two incomes to run a home now.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.860
So obviously we had to make some type type of sacrifice.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.884
Not just some, like a lot. And I don't regret it.
