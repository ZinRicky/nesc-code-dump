00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.960
making yourself invisible isn't that hard

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.580
just when I thought you couldn't take up any more space

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.700

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.600

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.780
what do you want people to see when they look at your clothes

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.640
that they're capable of anything

00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:11.140

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.760
can make any outfit you want

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.360
but I don't deserve to wear them

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:17.160

your whole line

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.000
it breaks my heart

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.780
to know that you can't give yourself what you've given everyone else

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.060
free clothes

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.140
confidence

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.230
if you could have it any superpower in the world

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.760
