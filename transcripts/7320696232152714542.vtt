00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.920
so first of all

00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:02.400
despite the cute thing that my kids said

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:04.760
I absolutely have yelled at my kids before

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:06.480
I talked on here before about how

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.120
respectful parenting wasn't always my method of parenting

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:12.840
and I have found my way into it and have gotten better with it over time

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.720
to the point now that me yelling is such a rare occurrence

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.780
that they don't even remember that I've done it

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.480
so how do you teach your kids emotional regulation

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:23.460
honestly you teach yourself emotional regulation first

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.480
and how do you go about that well

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:27.300
you look at what triggers you the most

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.500
and you ask why it triggers you the most

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.300
and then you do a great deal of therapy and healing

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.860
because there's always a why

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.920
now beyond that

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.540
because I know that probably sounds super

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.780
um difficult to start doing that sort of journey um

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.320
modeling emotional regulation

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:44.720
is the best way to teach your kids how to emotionally regulate

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:46.520
so when I get super overwhelmed

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:47.280
which we all do

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.360
I'm neurodivergent

00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:49.200
I'm a stay at home mom

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:51.100
my kids are with me 24 7

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.200
we're going to get overwhelmed

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:55.980
I model things like taking a little break

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.720
doing some deep breaths

00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:00.020
just standing in my body and being like

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.800
before reacting

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.240
and when you model those behaviors

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:09.400
those are what you're teaching your kids to do when you get overwhelmed

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:11.880
which is why I get very angry at my husband

00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:14.200
who has less good emotional regulation skills

00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:16.360
and throws giant man tantrum sometimes

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:18.680
but if yelling is something you wanna stop doing

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:21.900
it's okay that it can still happen every now and then

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.880
as long as you apologize to your kids

00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:25.720
you have a conversation about why it's not like

00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:27.280
the appropriate response to something

00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:28.400
and you commit to do better

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:30.280
or try to do better in the future

00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:31.400
and then back it up

00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:33.220
it's okay for parents to be human

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.880
but we also have to be compassionate

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.600
I also highly recommend the book The Whole Brain Child

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:39.560
it taught me a lot about child development

00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:42.520
and their even ability to have emotional regulation

00:01:42.521 --> 00:01:45.260
and what kind of ages those things come into play

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.300
and the conversations you're gonna have about appropriate emotional responses

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.800
is gonna be different for the age of your children

00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:57.440
but we have had ongoing and repetitive conversations about how tantrums

00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:02.080
and outburst and yelling is the body's way of getting rid of all of the yucky

00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:03.560
big feelings that you're feeling

00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:06.720
and trying to throw them out into the universe so you can get rid of them

00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:10.840
but it really just gives them to other people and expands them

00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:12.440
instead of gets them away

00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:17.180
you cannot give your anger to someone else and expect it to get smaller

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.160
that's the conversation I have with my kids

00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:22.000
and you'll notice when you yell at your kids

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:25.300
you're not getting rid of your frustration and angry

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.960
you can almost watch it shut down the communication with your kid

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:29.600
and watch the

00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:33.080
your kid become more angry or more sad

00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:35.280
which is just big feelings turned inward

00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:36.680
everyone gets overwhelmed

00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:38.120
everyone gets ragy

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:41.340
everyone gets a short fuse every now and then

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.680
but practicing

00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:46.400
and trying to do better each time you get in a situation where you feel that way

00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:47.560
is the best way to do it

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:52.080
and the best way to get help in doing that is to search your own demons

00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.100
I hope this helps
