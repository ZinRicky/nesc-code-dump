00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.640
Oh, I absolutely called the police.

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.281
The police were here. I actually know the police

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:05.681
and have a really good report with the police,

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:07.921
because when I was a bartender at the little dive bar

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:09.541
where I met this piece of shit,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.120
the police came in all the time,

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:11.481
and it was, like,

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:12.961
my job to serve them and kind of, like,

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:14.821
like, keep the relationship with them.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.320
So I feel very, very safe in my community.

00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:19.161
Very, very safe.

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.161
I feel like the police did,

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:22.641
like, three police officers were here in SUVs.

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:23.641
Like, they were looking,

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:25.621
taking pictures, opening the car.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.960
They laughed, they listened to, like,

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.521
I told them where they live,

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:30.081
everything. And, like,

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:31.881
I don't have proof of this,

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:33.801
that it's these people. I'm just,

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:35.001
you know, two plus two is four.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.961
The math is mathing. It's making sense of who it is.

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:38.861
Do you know what I mean?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.200
So, no,

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.561
I never fucking stay quiet.

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:42.881
I'm never gonna fucking just be like,

00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:44.161
oh, no.

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:45.361
The police were called at me to report.

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:46.481
I gave them their names, their number,

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:48.241
their description, their fucking everything.

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:49.561
Told them where to find the car.

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:50.521
And the police went looking.

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:50.961
They're like, oh,

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:52.961
we didn't find the car. And then I'm like,

00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:54.081
well, I bet you the car is there now,

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:56.521
and the car was it. So we're on it.

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.041
The police were back talking to my neighbors.

00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:00.221
Like, it's not like I just take the shit laying Down!

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.740
I just want the whole entire world to see

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.760
what happens when alpha men get mad.

00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:11.521
They're so big and strong until a girl stands up to them

00:01:11.522 --> 00:01:13.081
and then they're all of a sudden a little bitch

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:14.581
and got a resort to bullying.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.760
And it needs to be highlighted

00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:18.081
in the same way

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:21.841
that Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski are just making fucking jokes,

00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:25.721
that 72 year old Bill Belichick is shacking up with a 24 year old.

00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:27.201
Her brain isn't even fully developed.

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:31.061
She is literally practically a fucking child

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020
and they just make jokes about it.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.720
This is what women have to stand up for. Women!

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.321
Women have to say what the fuck is going on?

00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:39.901
And this is how these fucking men treat women!
