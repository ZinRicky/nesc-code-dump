00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.040
I don't know about y'all

00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:03.881
but men who have no chill and text you,

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:09.741
or double text you if you take too long to respond are so attractive in my eyes.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:13.241
Itâ€™s adorable and it reminds me that you're thinking of me.

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:15.681
It means you can't get enough of me.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:19.921
But, if you as a man are nonchalant about texting or talking to me,

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:20.478
then bye.

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:22.521
 That means you don't care about me,

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.281
so why should I care about you?

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:27.185
In my eyes that's just not attractive.
