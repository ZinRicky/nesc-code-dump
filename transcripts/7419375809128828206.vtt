00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:01.641
Yeah. Like,

00:00:01.642 --> 00:00:03.521
do you wanna control what happens to your body

00:00:03.522 --> 00:00:05.481

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:06.561
I wanna control my own body.

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:07.241

Pop off! You don't know what reproductive freedom is?

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.121
It's the freedom for your body to have your own choice over your body.

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:26.681
Reproductive freedom. Oh, absolutely.

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:28.521
And do we support reproductive freedom?

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:29.201
Yeah, of course.

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:29.681
Yeah, we do.

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:32.241
Why do we support it? Guess a woman's right.

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:34.081
Absolutely. Pop off.
