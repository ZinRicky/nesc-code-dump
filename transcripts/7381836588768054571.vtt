00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.640
So many people have asked me what a tribewife is like,

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.441
what makes it different from somebody like me

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:07.001
who's like a stay at home mom or traditional homemaker.

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:10.001
And I think I finally come up with like a couple of qualifiers

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:12.401
because not every homesteading account is a tribewife account.

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.661
Not every home making or stay at home mom account

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.060
is a tribewife account.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.600
Starting off they have to be a stay at home mom or homemaker.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:19.881
But not just that,

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:24.081
they have to believe that that is the natural given role for women.

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:25.501
Number two is the aesthetic.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.800
Trad wives dress femininely,

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:30.081
wear dresses, have makeup on,

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:32.881
are not like the hot mess mom archetype.

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:36.421
They are the polished and put together mom again

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.720
because that is the image that they believe

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:40.481
women should be portraying.

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:42.721
Number three is like the religious undertones.

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:46.941
These women look at traditional homemaking as an offshoot

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.820
of their religious morality.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.760
And a lot of this gets wrapped up also with like purity culture.

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:53.201
And I wanna make another video on that

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:54.681
cause that's where the pipeline is.

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:55.821
And then class.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.000
Most trad wife accounts are middle class or higher.

00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.432
There's a lot to unpack there.
