00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.780
Alright. I don't know if y'all noticed, um,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.600
my stuff may have disappeared for a little bit,

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:10.301
so. Was not planning on that.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.120
Apparently,

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:14.981
there was some issue with some of the things that I was posting,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.580
IE, supporting women who want to stay home with their babies.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.920
Anyway, I got it back.

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:27.541
And I want to personally thank TikTok for understanding that

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.020
I am just here to support women

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.680
and I'm not shaming anyone,

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:33.681
and I love all my followers.

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:38.381
And I'm here to discuss my experience as a stay at home mom

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.980
and what I went through when I tried to go back to work. And,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.600
yeah, there's so much I wanna say,

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:48.081
but, you know,

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:52.341
caution tape. I'll get back to posting on Monday. Mwah.
