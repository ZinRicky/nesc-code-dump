Magnets on your fridge is like

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:05.521
the best way to add personality to an otherwise boring kitchen

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:08.021
sometimes. And I found these fridge beats.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.800
It's this magnet that looks like a little music tile

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.701
and it even has like the little circle green button.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.160
They are having a Black Friday and Christmas sale,

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:21.701
but it's 1995 for the classic and 2595 for the upgraded version.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.840
There's a ton of different designs too.

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:25.921
It doesn't have to be this multi grid of pictures.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.641
It's just the cutest thing ever.

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:31.820
I absolutely love it and it makes for the perfect gift.
