00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.360
Our family milk cow, Cora,

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:03.841
is officially dry, and we really hope she's pregnant.

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:05.881
Back in August, we took her over to a friend's house

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:08.041
who had a ball when we drove through the driveway.

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:10.521
She was so happy to see other cows

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:12.661
because she is a lone cow on our homestead.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.720
We saw the ball get the job done within the first few minutes,

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.881
but I left her there for a few days just to make sure the job was done.

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:20.321
So I took a blood sample from her towel,

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:22.781
and then I put it on this test strip I got from Amazon,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.200
and it's kinda similar to a home pregnancy test,

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.821
but you use blood instead of urine.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.480
The results take 20 minutes to appear,

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:30.461
so we hung out and played with some Turkey feathers.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.160
Now, I did show positive before the 20 minutes,

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:34.161
but I just wanted to make sure.

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:35.321
But this is at 20 minutes.

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:36.921
It definitely is a positive result.

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:39.781
So she is 12 weeks pregnant right now.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.360
She had her last cow in July of 2023.

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:44.841
So it's been over a year since she had her last calf.

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:48.001
And she won't have her next calf until July 2025.

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.781
So that would have given her a two year break between calving.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.280
That's something that's not super common in the dairy industry,

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:54.961
but in the homestead, you can definitely do that.

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:56.861
I've only just dried her up this week,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.480
so we had a long time of having Her a milk before

00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:02.681
we needed to dry her up. I just needed the break.

00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:06.001
She needed the break. She start her supply started to really drop.

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:08.921
But now she's gonna have a nice long break before she has her new calf.

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:10.581
And we all can't wait.
