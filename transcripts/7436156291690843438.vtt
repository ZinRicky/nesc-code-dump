00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
how is misogyny different than the patriarchy

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:05.240
and how are those different from sexism

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:07.160
and let's also talk about Shrek

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:09.480
the patriarchy women are subordinate to men

00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:11.280
there's like a gendered hierarchy

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:12.940
just like how in Shrek

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.800
the fairy tale creatures are subordinate to the human like characters

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:19.320
misogyny is the mechanism

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.720
it's like the tools that we use to sustain the patriarchy

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:25.680
it's how we keep people in line in Shrek and in real life

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:29.560
they're using laws they're using policies to enforce this subordination

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:31.080
social stigma and pressures

00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.440
and policing is also another mechanism

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:36.680
to ensure that people are acting according to their gender

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:38.960
or fairytale creature characterness

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:43.940
and sexism is the belief that is justifying the misogyny and the patriarchy

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.520
belief that ogres are just naturally smelly

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:49.760
they are naturally less than they naturally belong in swamps

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:53.280
weâ€™re using that belief system to justify keeping them in the swamps

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:54.560
and treating them differently

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:57.760
keep in mind that the misogyny that you face as a fairy tale creature

00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:01.940
may look very different depending on what type of fairy tale creature you are

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.040
I don't know I'm still going on with this analogy

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:06.240
basically women are not treated monolithically

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:09.080
so the type of misogyny that you face is going to look very different

00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:11.600
if you are a white woman or a woman of color

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.240
or you have a disability

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:16.240
or based on your class or based on your sexual orientation

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:16.960
things like that

00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:21.580
and feminism is an ideology that pursues the Equality of the sexes
