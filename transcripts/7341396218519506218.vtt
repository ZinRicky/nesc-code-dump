00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.400
I started building a career at 15 years old,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.520
and here's how I did it.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.640
When I was 14,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.880
I started a blog,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.360
and I soon realized that I needed a better camera

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.800
so I could take good pictures to my blog.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.640
I got a camera,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.560
and soon after,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.920
I realized that I prefer taking pictures of people

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.400
than I did a flat lace.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.320
So I had a friend who was graduating,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.520
and I convinced her to let me take her senior picture.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.680
I took her senior pictures

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.920
and she showed them to her friends,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.580
and one of her friends asked me

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.760
if I would take her senior pictures.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.520
At that moment,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.160
I realized this is what I wanna do with my life.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.680
I spent 15 and 16 graduating from high school,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.680
building a portfolio,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.640
doing discounted shoots for people,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.880
and developing a website.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.560
And my parents had paid

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.240
for me to take specialized courses in photography.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.980
Since this is what I wanted to do.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.200
I applied all the knowledge that I had gathered

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.120
and I started paying for Google ads.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.000
I booked a proposal.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.880
I was shooting lots of couples and families,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.880
and I was enjoying it so much.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.800
I started working as a second judor

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.120
for a wedding photographer in my area,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.320
and I got the experience of shooting weddings.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.440
And then I realized I want to do weddings.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.220
At 18, I booked my first

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.160
three weddings within a very short time frame.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.080
Then I got married

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.480
and Moved my business.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.880
I trained my husband to be my second shooter,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.400
and over the next three years,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.160
we traveled thousands of miles around the US

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.540
shooting weddings together.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.480
Finally, it became way too much stress,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.680
and my health just disintegrated.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.760
So I quit about a year and a half ago.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.480
But I gained so much experience,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.871
and I'm so thankful that
