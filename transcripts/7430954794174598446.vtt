One of my dad's favorite things to eat was pie.

00:03.801 --> 00:06.581
He loves sweet pies and he loves savory pies.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.740
So that was one of our fall dishes,

00:10.320 --> 00:12.720
was a savory pie. So that's what I'm making today.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.641
I'm making a beef pie with our beef soup bones.

00:15.642 --> 00:18.581
They're very meaty. Our butcher leaves on a lot of meat,

00:18.840 --> 00:21.940
so we seared those and got those slow cooking.

00:21.960 --> 00:26.660
Then I diced up some of our bacon and mushrooms and cooked those down,

00:27.040 --> 00:29.160
added those into the beef soup bones,

00:29.161 --> 00:32.261
and then we added some carrots and leeks,

00:32.440 --> 00:34.380
bunch of garlic, onions,

00:34.960 --> 00:36.760
and then we sauteed those.

00:36.761 --> 00:39.101
And then after that, we added flour,

00:39.280 --> 00:41.500
some maple sugar, a little bit of vinegar,

00:41.600 --> 00:44.160
a lot of apple cider, some bone broth,

00:44.161 --> 00:45.741
and then a bunch of herbs.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.440
And we added all that back into the pot with the soup bones

00:49.441 --> 00:51.821
to slow cook for a few hours.

00:52.440 --> 00:56.120
Then I got started on the rough puff pastry.

00:56.121 --> 00:57.901
So I added everything to the bowl,

00:58.080 --> 01:00.280
formed them into some balls,

01:00.281 --> 01:02.081
and let them sit for a little bit,

01:02.082 --> 01:03.661
and then we started rolling.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.940
So we roll out, we folds,

01:06.360 --> 01:08.820
then we roll out again, we folds,

01:09.200 --> 01:11.480
and then we roll out a few more times and fold,

01:11.481 --> 01:15.561
so you can achieve those beautiful crispy layers,

01:15.562 --> 01:21.001
flaky layers on your pie. And then the beef filling was done.

01:21.002 --> 01:22.401
The beef was fine off the bones.

01:22.402 --> 01:24.901
It was so good, it smelled incredible.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.120
So roll that a Rough puff pastry,

01:27.121 --> 01:33.021
laid that on top, we did a little egg wash and some scoring,

01:33.520 --> 01:36.920
and then into the oven it went for 35 minutes,

01:36.921 --> 01:40.381
or just until it was bubbly and golden brown.

01:40.680 --> 01:44.740
While that was cooking, we whipped up some mashed potatoes and peas,

01:44.840 --> 01:50.140
because the three of them are the ultimate fall comfort meal.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.240
Um, after we plated it,

01:52.241 --> 01:56.161
I sprinkled some of our French salt and pepper on,

01:56.162 --> 01:58.401
and it was the perfect finishing touch.

01:58.402 --> 02:01.263
Was so good. 10 out of 10. Perfect fall meal.
