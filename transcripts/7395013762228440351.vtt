00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
I think one of the top things that Democrats have to do

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:05.321
in the selection is reclaim patriotism.

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:06.361
Like, how are the people

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:10.661
who want to destroy the uniquely American things about this country,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.140
like freedom and liberty

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.240
to do whatever the fuck you want with your body?

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:16.701
How are the people who wanna destroy that freedom and liberty?

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.320
Why do they have a claim on patriotism?

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:20.921
If you want to make America better,

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:22.581
that's because you love America.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.942
That's patriotism. Don't let them steal that away from you.
