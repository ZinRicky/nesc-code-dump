00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Let's make some cottage pie

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.700
and let's talk through a few things I can do better next time.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.820
First I started with peeling and chopping my potatoes,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.540
and then I added water and salt and put them on the boil.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.780
Once fork tender, I drained them

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.240
and then I added butter, sour cream,

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:23.921
and milk. Here was my first mistake,

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:26.861
as the potatoes ended up crumbly from not enough dairy.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.220
I should have used more sour cream,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.920
some cream cheese if I had any,

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:32.821
and cream instead of milk.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.260
I set them aside while I browned my beef.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.940
I would have added onion if I had some.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.960
I added chopped carrots because I didn't have vegetable medley,

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:44.601
and then I added a half cup of flour,

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:45.921
but I needed a three quarter cup.

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:48.761
Actually added a quart of homemade bone broth,

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:52.601
Worcestershire sauce, onion powder and garlic powder,

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:53.941
and salt and pepper.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.460
I poured the mixture into my 9 by 13,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.000
and then I added a quart of canned green beans at the end

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.661
so they wouldn't get soggy.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.140
I then topped with my crumbly mashed potatoes,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.140
molding it together with my hands,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.440
and then I put it in the oven at 3:50 for 45 minutes.

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:18.121
I did add a tray underneath to catch the mess of it spilled over,

00:01:18.122 --> 00:01:20.681
which it did. Overall it was really good,

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:24.261
it just needs a few adjustments next time. Recipe in the caption.
