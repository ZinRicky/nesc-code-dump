00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.460
Only men. Predators is patriarchy.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.640
Y'all don't see that men are not predators.

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:06.561
What's a predator?

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:08.601
A predator is someone that hunts prey.

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:09.921
And what do they hunt pray for?

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:11.581
They hunt prey for food.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.260
And more importantly,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.020
they are not hunting the same species.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.460
They're hunting a different species.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.540
Your husband, when he goes on his boy trip and goes and,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.080
you know, gets a deer, and it feeds you for the winter,

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:27.541
that's a predator.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.400
That's a predator.

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:33.461
Calling men who victimize women and children predators

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.840
minimizes the severity of what they're doing,

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:41.221
because what it does is it ties their actions to their nature.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.460
It is not in man's nature to victimize

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.660
the female counterpart of his own species.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.560
If he is a lion and you are the lioness, and he hunts.

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:56.241
Actually, I think maybe the lioness hunts,

00:00:56.242 --> 00:00:57.941
but for the sake of this,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.640
the food, the deer,

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:00.721
the other species,

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:04.541
and brings it back to feed you and the children,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.180
that is a predator.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.240
A lion that terrorizes his own village and his own species

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:15.261
and the females in it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.000
is a monster. He is a freak of nature,

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:24.381
unfit for the company of his fellow species.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.540
He is.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.680
I don't know. We need to come up with a better name than predator,

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:30.901
because that's not a predator.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.260
That's a monster.
