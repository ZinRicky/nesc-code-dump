don't think you have to say brunette if you wanna try being blonde

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:04.880
simply because like

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:10.080
of my personal opinions about blonde as it pertains to the white beauty standard

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:12.720
because I found blonde okay

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.360
even if you can have criticisms or have like

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.040
observances about the beauty standard

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:18.720
doesn't mean that you also don't like

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:22.680
adhere to them because they are the standard practice of the day

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.260
and I just like changing my hair color cause it's fun

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.480
but you will notice

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:30.340
or at least like I've noticed as somebody who's changed my hair color a lot

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.120
um and other people can corroborate in the comments

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:35.020
if you've had a similar experience

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.020
you get more male attention with blonde hair

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.860
you just do so that's some food for thought
