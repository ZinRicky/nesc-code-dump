At church on Sunday,

00:03.320 --> 00:07.900
we started talking about how we can be better neighbors to each other.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.800
And someone chimed in and said that whenever she's sick,

00:13.801 --> 00:15.321
she knows that her one neighbor

00:15.322 --> 00:18.381
is gonna bring over her famous cabbage soup.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.540
And I just love that.

00:22.080 --> 00:22.640
First of all,

00:22.641 --> 00:27.301
I love the idea of being known for your famous cabbage soup.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.340
And I also love that this neighbour was taking over her soup

00:32.360 --> 00:34.380
to anyone that was sick around her.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.840
So when I got home, I knew what we were gonna have for.

00:37.841 --> 00:40.361
For lunch. It was gonna be cabbage soup.

00:40.362 --> 00:42.881
So we went to the garden, we yanked out all of our cabbages,

00:42.882 --> 00:44.921
we clean them, we sliced them.

00:44.922 --> 00:49.381
We also sliced up some shallots and garlic and diced those.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.120
And then we needed a protein,

00:51.121 --> 00:56.401
so we added our ground pork in a bowl with tons of spices and herbs,

00:56.402 --> 00:58.341
and we made a ground pork meatball.

00:58.440 --> 01:04.040
We cook those up, and then we sauteed our shallots and garlic.

01:04.041 --> 01:07.901
We added some bone broth. Then we threw in all our cabbage.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.880
I also used our paprika, Rosemary,

01:11.881 --> 01:13.361
French salt blend in the soup,

01:13.362 --> 01:15.241
and it was the perfect spice.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.281
It was so good.

01:16.282 --> 01:19.821
And then we threw in the meatballs at the end and let it simmer,

01:20.000 --> 01:21.560
and it turned out amazing.

01:21.561 --> 01:23.801
We had it for lunch, we had it for dinner.

01:23.802 --> 01:29.161
To serve, I put some sharp cheese and a hefty squeeze of lemon

01:29.162 --> 01:31.081
and some fresh Thyme. Which

01:31.082 --> 01:34.281
I feel like the lemon just brightened the whole soup up

01:34.282 --> 01:36.301
and made it so good.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.960
And I just want you all to know that I'm on my way

01:39.961 --> 01:43.061
to perfecting my famous cabbage soup recipe.
