00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
We start here at the cone.

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:03.201
This is an efficient, humane,

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.521
fast way to get it done.

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:06.961
We use garden snips and you can use a sharp knife.

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.881
I can't show you the actual process here.

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:10.281
You'll see his feet is still moving,

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:12.561
but he has passed on. Nerves, um,

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:16.061
built up in the tendons and muscles will still move after.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.980
Hence the term running around like a headless chicken.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.660
That process takes literally less than a couple seconds.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.960
Um, and the chicken had no idea what was coming next.

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:31.141
I'm gonna dip the chicken in 150 degree water with some dish soap.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.500
This helps remove the feathers so it gets into the skin.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.480
The temperature opens the pores

00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:40.741
and this helps the chickens feathers release from the skin.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.760
This is something we invested in

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:46.761
as we will be planning on raising more chickens for meat.

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:48.301
But you can also rent these.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.760
This makes removing the feathers pretty easy.

00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:54.041
This takes anywhere from a minute to five minutes to do each bird.

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:55.961
You can put multiple birds in here at the same time

00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:58.641
and that also helps them tumble around better. Here.

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.961
The feet skin didn't come off perfectly

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:04.361
because I didn't dip the feet in enough into the hot water,

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:05.321
which is fine.

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:08.461
I just wasn't particularly wanting to keep the feet of this bird.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.000
I give the bird a rinse off

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.121
and then I did notice

00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:13.401
this one had a little bit more fuzzy feathers underneath the wing.

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:16.861
Which happens sometimes, so I just removed those by hand.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.760
Now everyone has their own way of butchering a chicken.

00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:24.041
This is just the way I do it.

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:25.821
I start by cutting off the feet.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.080
To get the feet off

00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:29.901
you just need to cut the skin and tendons around from the joint

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.780
and then kind of they will just release once you got those tendons.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.400
Now a lot of people would think

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:36.921
what in the world would you do with a chicken foot?

00:01:36.922 --> 00:01:38.281
But you can definitely still eat them.

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:39.601
They're great for making broth,

00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:41.261
which you can then make soups with,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.920
so definitely not throw them.

00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:45.441
In a way. They also make great dog treats.

00:01:45.442 --> 00:01:47.961
There's no reason to waste any part of the chicken.

00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:50.201
You can pretty much use every part of the chicken

00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:52.001
except the intestines. Although

00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:54.561
I have seen in the comments that some people still eat the intestines,

00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:55.861
which is kinda interesting.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.000
Sounds kinda gross, but I know obviously that sausages are made out of,

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:01.341
um. Pig intestines.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.920
Um, so yeah,

00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:03.441
back in the day

00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:05.721
people used to use every part of the animal for something.

00:02:05.722 --> 00:02:08.441
I've just never heard of anyone actually using chicken intestines,

00:02:08.442 --> 00:02:09.861
but I will look into that.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.040
Now we're on to removing the crop.

00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:15.481
Now this is the most tedious part of the whole process for me.

00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:17.041
The crop is slippery, slimy,

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:18.161
and kinda hard to grab hold of.

00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:19.501
You need to remove it

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.360
and it's attached to the Breast and to the neck by membranes.

00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:24.921
And it's very hard to remove.

00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:26.001
But you don't wanna use a knife.

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:28.501
I'm just to run my fingers through here,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.320
try to get my finger between the, um,

00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:33.621
crop and the other parts of the chicken.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.440
And I'm pretty much just gonna use my hands

00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:37.241
and pressure to remove this.

00:02:37.242 --> 00:02:40.201
If you use a knife, you can risk punching in the crop

00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:41.741
and that just makes a mess.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.400
Um, it is pretty simple.

00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:45.761
It's just a process. I'm gonna pull on that crop

00:02:45.762 --> 00:02:47.721
and it did release from the organs inside.

00:02:47.722 --> 00:02:49.901
I snipped it off and put it in the gut bucket.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.040
Now I'm gonna move on to removing the internal organs.

00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:55.741
I'm gonna make a slight cut and have that knife facing outwards.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.420
And I'm gonna use my hands to rip over the cavity.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.080
This way I don't punch or any of the internal organs.

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:04.561
This is really important because this is where the bacteria,

00:03:04.562 --> 00:03:06.801
like salmonella is could be present,

00:03:06.802 --> 00:03:08.481
and I don't want that to go on the meat.

00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:09.641
I'm gonna gently

00:03:09.642 --> 00:03:11.841
but firmly grab hold of these organs and pull them out.

00:03:11.842 --> 00:03:12.561
They are attached

00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.201
and they have membranes kinda holding them to the cavity.

00:03:15.202 --> 00:03:17.861
I'm just running my hands through that to pull them out

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.500
and break up those membranes.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.960
There is the gizzard right there.

00:03:20.961 --> 00:03:21.961
Some people like to eat that.

00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:23.241
I'm now removing the heart.

00:03:23.242 --> 00:03:27.201
Now I'm moving on to cutting out the butthole from The intestines.

00:03:27.202 --> 00:03:28.841
This part is really important to not cut.

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:29.721
The intestine right there.

00:03:29.722 --> 00:03:30.601
It's full of poop right there,

00:03:30.602 --> 00:03:34.241
as you can see. I don't want that on my meat, um,

00:03:34.242 --> 00:03:36.621
cause that could contain salmonella or another bacteria.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.440
And then gonna remove that and put that in the gut bucket.

00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:41.241
I'm gonna get the chicken a good rinse here.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:42.521
This chicken still has the neck on

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:44.161
because I did end up parting out this chicken,

00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:45.441
so I didn't remove the neck.

00:03:45.442 --> 00:03:47.441
But most of my chickens, I do remove the neck,

00:03:47.442 --> 00:03:49.361
and then I place them in these bags.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.601
This is specifically made for chickens.

00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:53.941
And you can shrink and wrap them under hot water.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.360
I'm gonna make sure that the chicken neck bone

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.901
is not poking out the bottom,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.800
so the skin's flapped over that part so it doesn't pierce the bag.

00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:02.027
And then they go on ice.
