00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
About 2 months ago

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:03.137
I put some little baby seedings in the ground 

00:00:03.138 --> 00:00:04.040
for our Winter Garden

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:05.400
and I think it's time for an update

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.680
because I'm lowkey shocked at how well she's doing

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.960
I started by pulling some weeds and chucking them on the grass

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.229
cause they looked a lot like 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.586
my husband's problem for later 

00:00:12.587 --> 00:00:14.600
and we've been enjoying so much of this rocket

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:15.840
but it's officially bolted

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.800
which must be why they call it rocket right

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:18.880
I found some helpful friends

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.840
popped them back and restocked my baby rocket

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:22.960
which I think my American friends call arugula

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:24.560
and you might not know it just by looking at it

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:27.000
but we've actually been eating from this garden every single day

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.760
moment of appreciation for the cutest broccoli I've ever seen in my life

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.120
I've never grown broccoli before

00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:32.934
but I must admit it's the most exciting thing 

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:34.000
I think I've ever done ever

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.520
I harvested rocket silverbeet

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.360
Cavolo nero kale cos lettuce 

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:38.380
spinach and bok choy 

00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:40.520
before it was time to head inside and process

00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:41.720
and I don't know if it's just me

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:42.920
but even when I wear gloves

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:44.120
my hands still get dirty

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:47.000
as a mum of young children who loves to clean and get outside

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.160
I wash my hands so many times a day

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:52.080
and I have found some soaps in the past have irritated my skin

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:53.160
especially under my rings

00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:55.600
But Protex is full of Omega 3 flaxseed oils

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:57.900
which provides a natural antibacterial protection 

00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:59.981
while maintaining the moisture within my skin

00:00:59.982 --> 00:01:02.480
And Iâ€™ve found Protex to be gentle enough for everyday use

00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:04.113
by the way my green thumbed mother in law 

00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:05.280
taught me this trick years ago

00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:06.480
if you wanna get rid of a stem

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.960
turn the leaf upside down and hack sides on an angle

00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:10.360
it'll leave you with nothing but leaves

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:12.280
but some stems I like so take it or leave it

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:13.616
that's our garden haul for today
