00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.800
Get ready with me for a day at home.

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.401
I was influenced to buy these velvet non slip hangers

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:06.601
but I hate them so much.

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:08.561
It is so hard to get clothes on and off of them,

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:10.321
especially trying to do one handed.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:11.001
These overalls

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.401
with this shirt are giving Little House on the Prairie vibes,

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:14.841
but I'm not even mad about it.

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:16.521
And this deodorant from Primarily Pure

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:18.721
is the only natural deodorant that actually works.

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:21.201
Trust me on this. If you've tried all natural deodorant,

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:22.681
you know that that is a bold statement,

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:25.001
but I have three different scents and they all work great.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.921
I also use primarily Pure's cleansing oil

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:28.641
and purifying bar to wash my face.

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:31.241
Oops, and that happened anyway.

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:33.601
Back to low tox skincare products.

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:35.801
I've also been using dime beauty products.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.841
I love their skincare and their perfumes.

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:39.321
I have the work skincare system

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.121
and it works great on my sensitive skin.

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:44.541
Felt cute and Tuesday date night are my two favorite perfumes.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.960
Dime Beauty is the only perfumes I can use

00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:48.461
that do not give me a headache.
