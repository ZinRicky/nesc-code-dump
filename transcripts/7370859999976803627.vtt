00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.440
if you are heartbroken about what's going on in Gaza

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:05.240
there are ways that you can directly help families

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:06.520
there's a project called Olive Branch

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:07.520
which I'm sure um

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:08.880
many of you have been seeing in your feeds

00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:12.040
thanks to amazing creators who have been drawing attention to it

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:13.360
they have this incredible spreadsheet

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:15.760
where you can get involved in so many different ways

00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:17.760
what they're encouraging people to do

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:19.000
no matter what your following is

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.680
is to choose and sponsor a family and encourage people to support and uh

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.140
donate to their fund

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.760
in uh

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:27.640
their disability column they uh

00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:29.080
drew attention to Ibrahim

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:32.880
who is a psychologist who has worked with a lot of autistic children in Gaza

00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:34.280
he has an autistic daughter

00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:38.380
and I have decided to support their fund in order for them to escape

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.680
any of the donations are $5

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:44.800
so I know that people are really strapped right now

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:48.800
and I totally understand if you are not in a financial situation uh

00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:51.000
or position to make a donation

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.780
but every dollar counts

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.840
he is still trying to offer um

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:58.680
support to autistic children who are being displaced right now

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:02.100
his daughter needs medication and they cannot return to their home

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.840
even when he was trying to evacuate

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:08.080
he was still providing services for autistic children who are being displaced

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:10.660
and who as you can probably imagine

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.920
need so much support right now

00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:16.700
this is the centre that he created in Gaza for children with disabilities

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.800
they need our support in order to keep providing those services

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:21.200
if you can't afford um

00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:23.480
the donation you can go to his Instagram

00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:24.520
follow um

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:25.920
like and engage with his videos

00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:30.180
so that more people can come across them and support him and the center

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.480
I will put the link for the gofundme in my bio

00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:35.200
if you can't afford it right now um

00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:38.080
send it to someone who you think might be able to

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:41.140
so much that we can do in order to support children um

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.560
and families right now

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:43.480
so again uh

00:01:43.481 --> 00:01:44.680
go to Olive Branch

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:47.300
you'll find tons of ways of getting involved

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.590
thank you for listening until the end of this video I love you
