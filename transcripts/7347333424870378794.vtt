00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
Anyone else not enjoy going out anymore,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.400
like I'll have girlfriends call me up and say,

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:05.761
“hey girl,

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:07.121
what are you doing this weekend?”

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.821
I'm like nothing

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.480
They’re like “you wanna do something?”

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.561
Not really, in fact,

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:13.101
that's the last thing I wanna do,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.260
leave my house?

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.820
why why would I do that?

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.120
maybe it's because my social battery as an adult is now non existent

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:21.984
but I like staying home.

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:22.761
Maybe I’m depressed?

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:24.281
No, that's not depression.

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:27.161
I think it's because I don't like anyone else

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:30.581
besides my fiance and select close friends.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.720
if I go outside,

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:35.361
I see other people and people I don't know are scary.

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:37.201
maybe that's why?

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:38.681
I don't I really don't know?

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:41.629
but honestly I'm content chilling at home!
