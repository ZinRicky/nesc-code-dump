00:00.080 --> 00:02.840
I like going to the grocery store every two to three days

00:02.841 --> 00:05.881
instead of doing a big grocery shop once a week.

00:05.882 --> 00:10.141
Just helps me plan my meals better and also not waste as much food.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.960
I always start off in the produce section.

00:11.961 --> 00:14.121
It's my favorite section in the whole store.

00:14.122 --> 00:17.001
I usually go for five to six vegetables

00:17.002 --> 00:19.281
and obviously some herbs as well.

00:19.282 --> 00:21.681
Lately I've been obsessed with tomatoes,

00:21.682 --> 00:23.081
so I stocked up on those.

00:23.082 --> 00:25.001
And always on some avocado

00:25.002 --> 00:27.901
just to get some healthy fat into my diet as well.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.560
For fruit, I get whatever I'm craving or the kids are craving,

00:31.561 --> 00:33.161
but I always pick up bananas

00:33.162 --> 00:33.841
and then lucky

00:33.842 --> 00:36.921
wanted to try all of these different sodas in this queso.

00:36.922 --> 00:39.161
I also stumbled across some Swedish candy

00:39.162 --> 00:41.381
and obviously had to try that as well.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.600
And we made it over to the deli meat section.

00:43.601 --> 00:44.721
Got some salami,

00:44.722 --> 00:47.781
some cheese, olives for the kids to snack on.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.960
Since we still had milk and eggs at home,

00:49.961 --> 00:51.501
I didn't get any of that.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.520
I usually also go to the farmers market for those things,

00:54.521 --> 00:56.441
but we didn't make it this weekend,

00:56.442 --> 00:58.121
so the grocery store it was.

00:58.122 --> 01:00.521
After this, we headed over to Whole Foods.

01:00.522 --> 01:03.561
Forgot to get lemons and I wanted to make a recipe with lemons,

01:03.562 --> 01:04.841
so we got that.

01:04.842 --> 01:06.761
When I walk past this purple sweet potato,

01:06.762 --> 01:10.281
I had to get it because I love doing kimchi with sweet potato.

01:10.282 --> 01:12.281
They were all Sold out of a bunch of meat,

01:12.282 --> 01:15.601
so I didn't really get as much protein as I wanted to get,

01:15.602 --> 01:16.841
but I got some lamb,

01:16.842 --> 01:20.241
and then we stocked up on some miscellaneous things. Also.

01:20.242 --> 01:22.481
This yogurt, you guys is so good.

01:22.482 --> 01:23.961
With all the baking I've been doing,

01:23.962 --> 01:25.761
I needed to get some flour, too,

01:25.762 --> 01:26.841
and this is what we got.

01:26.842 --> 01:28.161
We got honey crisp apples,

01:28.162 --> 01:29.681
some lemon oranges,

01:29.682 --> 01:31.801
purple sweet potato and cucumber,

01:31.802 --> 01:34.761
papaya herbs. So this beautiful tomato,

01:34.762 --> 01:35.921
purple radishes,

01:35.922 --> 01:37.601
mushroom, leafy greens.

01:37.602 --> 01:38.621
Oh, cotto.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.560
And then for dairy,

01:39.561 --> 01:40.921
we got some yogurt,

01:40.922 --> 01:42.041
Parmesan cheese,

01:42.042 --> 01:44.041
feta cheese, and some cheddar.

01:44.042 --> 01:46.501
Also got some dates and blackberries.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.280
For protein, I got some lamb to roast deli meat.

01:49.281 --> 01:51.121
We love trying out new salamis.

01:51.122 --> 01:52.961
Been wanting to try these pickles,

01:52.962 --> 01:54.481
so I picked those up.

01:54.482 --> 01:57.621
And then I got a bunch of little random pantry items.
