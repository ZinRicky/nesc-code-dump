00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.440
okay I'm having a really bad

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:02.880
like sensory processing day

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:05.580
so let's get ready for a day at home with the kids

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.580
where I feel like I don't wanna crawl out of my own skin

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.000
I just got home from the gym

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.400
and this is what I was wearing

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.040
I could wear this but then I feel yucky

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:15.120
so I'm gonna go take a shower

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:16.300
and then we're gonna get changed

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.880
okay I put on this cute

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:20.900
comfy set I actually have this in three colors

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.640
I love it because it's loose

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:25.000
but it's very cute and once I add some accessories

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.240
you can totally run errands in this

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:28.600
I've done that before I also have some fuzzy socks on

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:30.640
so I'm gonna add it's really cold today

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:32.400
so I'm gonna add oh shoot

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:33.280
I should do my makeup first

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:34.500
I'm gonna do my makeup first

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.920
and yes

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:37.520
I will still do makeup on a day that I feel like shit

00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:38.920
because it just makes me feel better

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:40.000
um but I'm gonna do like

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:41.780
a light coverage like a CC cream

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.980
and just kind of do this with my hands

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.580
like aggressively

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.840
almost run out of this this is the Fenty Beauty matchstick

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:54.260
which I really like so do a little bit up there

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.060
they're not really into see it cause of the hat

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.580
a little concealer I always use Too Faced

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.120
but just like

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:03.140
a tiny bit just to cover dark circles in

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.280
a little blemish here but not full beat

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.280
a little goes a long way with this product too

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:09.280
you don't wanna overdo it

00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:11.760
same thing goes for these liquid blushes from Rare Beauty

00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.240
they a little tiny dot goes a long way

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.720
but I really love this color

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:17.240
this is uh

00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:18.480
it's called hope ah

00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:19.720
we could all use some of that

00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:22.580
I'm do a little bit of a wing because it's just my thing

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.000
alright hats back on

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.360
and then it's amazing what like

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:29.580
a pop of a lip color can do to make people think you've got your shit together

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.400
surely she can't be having a mental breakdown

00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:34.440
she has red lipstick on now

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:36.460
to serve a little extra count today

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.600
I'm gonna add on this absolutely gorgeous necklace

00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:42.060
that I got for my birthday this year

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.360
stunning right

00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:45.900
it's my first piece of like

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.560
maybe not my first piece

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:52.040
but that's one of the first pieces of real big girl jewelry that I bought myself

00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:52.840
which

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.140
I was very proud of although I do usually need my husband help me get it on

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.380
there we go isn't it just stunning

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.420
it's that ombre Topaz I love it

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.440
so yeah

00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:08.180
now I feel cozy and comfortable

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.140
but I could still leave if I needed to run errands and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.780
getting ready does make me feel better motherfucker
