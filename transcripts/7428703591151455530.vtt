My husband doesn't cook, but he bakes.

00:02.201 --> 00:03.681
When we got home late last night

00:03.682 --> 00:05.721
and I asked him to make me some cookie dough,

00:05.722 --> 00:06.681
he said he would

00:06.682 --> 00:09.601
only if I made us some vanilla ice cream to go with it.

00:09.602 --> 00:13.681
So after I agreed, he got started on mixing white and brown sugar,

00:13.682 --> 00:15.681
adding some soft butter, an egg,

00:15.682 --> 00:17.361
baking powder, baking soda,

00:17.362 --> 00:20.241
some salt. Can't forget about the vanilla.

00:20.242 --> 00:22.281
He gradually added flour and oats,

00:22.282 --> 00:24.761
and obviously a bunch of chocolate chips.

00:24.762 --> 00:27.881
This dough was so I couldn't help but snack on it.

00:27.882 --> 00:29.041
While that was set aside,

00:29.042 --> 00:33.161
I got started on making some vanilla ice cream by combining milk, sugar,

00:33.162 --> 00:34.681
heavy cream, and some vanilla,

00:34.682 --> 00:38.361
letting that heat up on the stove while I made my egg mixture.

00:38.362 --> 00:40.841
Once that came together, I tempered my eggs,

00:40.842 --> 00:42.241
poured that back into the pot,

00:42.242 --> 00:46.161
and let that heat up before straining it through a fine mesh strainer.

00:46.162 --> 00:49.081
Set that bowl on top of some ice to cool it down,

00:49.082 --> 00:52.461
and then popped it in the freezer so it would cool down quicker.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.800
This point, lucky started baking off the cookies

00:54.801 --> 00:57.241
and batches for about seven minutes.

00:57.242 --> 01:00.361
Once they came out, he transferred them over to a wire rack.

01:00.362 --> 01:02.521
While the last batch of cookies were baking,

01:02.522 --> 01:05.781
I churned my ice cream until it hit soft serve consistency,

01:06.160 --> 01:09.860
added some warm cookies, and this was the perfect midnight snack.
