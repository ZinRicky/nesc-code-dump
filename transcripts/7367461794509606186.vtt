00:00.000 --> 00:01.480
It's crazy to think about that

00:01.481 --> 00:04.401
I gave birth to our third baby not even a month ago,

00:04.402 --> 00:05.721
so our afternoons,

00:05.722 --> 00:08.481
evenings, and nights look so much different now.

00:08.482 --> 00:10.841
I always used to think that this phase never ends,

00:10.842 --> 00:14.561
but now I'm just learning to embrace it and find happiness in it.

00:14.562 --> 00:16.881
Today was one of the first hot days this year,

00:16.882 --> 00:19.561
so we decided to go swim in the pool.

00:19.562 --> 00:23.001
The babies have been obsessed with anything that crawls or flies,

00:23.002 --> 00:26.361
so they always need to catch whatever bugs they find.

00:26.362 --> 00:27.881
When dinner time rolled around,

00:27.882 --> 00:30.881
lucky gave the toddlers a bath and got them dressed in pajamas

00:30.882 --> 00:33.101
before we started making some dinner.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.080
Today was a really hectic and hard day,

00:35.081 --> 00:37.441
so we decided on something really simple,

00:37.442 --> 00:40.321
which was just some rice and some ground beef

00:40.322 --> 00:42.661
fried up with some vegetables and avocado.

00:42.720 --> 00:43.800
While I was making dinner,

00:43.801 --> 00:45.361
the kids needed a little snack,

00:45.362 --> 00:49.341
so I peeled some clementines for them just to tie them over.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.560
Lately, I've been cooking really quick dinners,

00:51.561 --> 00:53.561
and this is one of Lucky's favorites.

00:53.562 --> 00:55.281
This point, everyone was really hungry,

00:55.282 --> 00:57.161
so we sat at the table and ate

00:57.162 --> 01:00.401
before heading upstairs and getting the kids all ready for bed

01:00.402 --> 01:01.781
and tucking them in.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.520
I'm usually the one that cooks,

01:03.521 --> 01:05.361
so Lucky's the one that cleans.

01:05.362 --> 01:06.721
That's just how we always do it.

01:06.722 --> 01:08.721
Whoever cooks does not have to clean.

01:08.722 --> 01:09.761
He cleaned the kitchen,

01:09.762 --> 01:10.721
took out the trash,

01:10.722 --> 01:13.961
and then I headed Upstairs to nurse whimsy,

01:13.962 --> 01:15.961
and after that, get in the shower.

01:15.962 --> 01:17.721
I always need to shower at night.

01:17.722 --> 01:19.881
There's never a night that I can

01:19.882 --> 01:22.721
go to bed and unwind without taking a really,

01:22.722 --> 01:23.801
really hot shower.

01:23.802 --> 01:26.601
I like to keep it simple in the shower, and then when I get out,

01:26.602 --> 01:29.281
I lotion my body and do my skin routine.

01:29.282 --> 01:32.041
My eczema has been flaring up really bad lately again,

01:32.042 --> 01:35.361
so I try to use really gentle products on my skin.

01:35.362 --> 01:39.081
I also always slather my face in Vaseline before I go to bed.

01:39.082 --> 01:42.321
At this point, I remembered that I didn't feed my sourdough starter,

01:42.322 --> 01:44.281
so I rushed downstairs and did that

01:44.282 --> 01:46.701
and also took my postnatal vitamins.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.960
Got back upstairs,

01:47.961 --> 01:49.961
got little whimsy ready for bed,

01:49.962 --> 01:51.361
made sure to nurse her,

01:51.362 --> 01:53.961
and then it was my time to unwind,

01:53.962 --> 01:56.341
read my book, and head to bed after.
