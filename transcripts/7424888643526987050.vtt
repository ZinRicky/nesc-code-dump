00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
I am shocked and incensed,

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:03.161
and rightfully so.

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:06.261
I've spent the last four months in a hell with some called pregnancy

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.220
while I have been bedridden and too sick to care for myself.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.480
Too sick to take a shower or get my own food,

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:14.121
if I can even eat. I've had to rely on the care of others

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:15.681
while I lay helpless on the couch

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.561
day after day, unable to leave my home.

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:20.321
I've had nurses come to my house repeatedly

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:22.181
to give me IVs for dehydration

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.380
caused by days of non stop vomiting

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.600
after struggling with chronic illness and then struggling to conceive.

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.041
I've experienced trial in my life,

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:32.661
but this pregnancy is the hardest thing I have ever been through.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.760
Why am I incensed? I have been met with ableism,

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:37.441
derision, and condescension,

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:38.881
and I have realized through this experience

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:41.321
why so many women feel alone in motherhood.

00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:43.321
Because from the minute you get pregnant,

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:46.521
and even before you are met with the insensitive opinions of others.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:49.281
I've been told to just get a hobby and I'll forget about the nausea.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:50.921
I've been told if I struggle with pregnancy,

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:53.161
then I don't know how you're gonna be a mom.

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:55.181
I have been told that I am lazy,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.480
entitled, ungrateful,

00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:57.801
taking advantage of my husband,

00:00:57.802 --> 00:00:59.881
and insensitive to those experiencing infertility

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:00.481
because apparently

00:01:00.482 --> 00:01:02.741
you can't struggle with both infertility and pregnancy.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.680
I am not saying all this to complain about internet trolls,

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:06.201
but instead

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:10.021
to validate every woman who Feels guilty for struggling in pregnancy

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.120
because at the end of the day,

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:13.321
no matter how much you want that baby,

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:15.501
your struggle is still valid.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.860
It is not insensitive to share your journey.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.560
You deserve care and compassion.

00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:22.821
We all have the ability to lift people up and tear them down.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.240
I can't control my symptoms,

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:26.121
but I can control how I use my experience,

00:01:26.122 --> 00:01:28.321
and that will be to make other women feel seen,

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:30.073
and not alone for struggling.
