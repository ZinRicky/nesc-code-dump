00:00.120 --> 00:03.480
One of my very favorite trips that I've ever been on

00:03.481 --> 00:05.541
was a Mediterranean cruise

00:05.880 --> 00:08.500
that Daniel and I took when we were very first married.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.120
Because still to this day,

00:10.121 --> 00:13.661
we talk about the euros that we had.

00:14.120 --> 00:17.800
They were so good. And there was so. Yeah,

00:17.801 --> 00:19.121
the meat, the veggies,

00:19.122 --> 00:20.361
the feta, it was also good.

00:20.362 --> 00:22.621
So today I'm making a homemade euro.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.480
Getting started on my meat.

00:24.481 --> 00:27.581
So I put tons of herbs, bread crumbs,

00:27.920 --> 00:31.580
some spices, and then I put it in a loaf pan and baked that.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.660
Then while that was baking,

00:33.760 --> 00:37.100
I rolled out my sourdough pita.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.580
And pita is literally so easy to make.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.440
I started this morning. It's already ready to go.

00:43.441 --> 00:45.401
You just roll them out, put them in the hot skillet,

00:45.402 --> 00:46.641
and then as soon as they're done,

00:46.642 --> 00:49.701
you brush them with melted butter so they stay soft.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.800
Then last night, I soak some garbanzo beans overnight.

00:53.801 --> 00:57.201
Then we cooked them in garlic and sage and some salt,

00:57.202 --> 00:58.941
and then we made our homemade hummus,

00:59.480 --> 01:02.180
which was so creamy and so good.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.280
And then, um,

01:04.281 --> 01:06.281
the meat was done. I sliced it thin,

01:06.282 --> 01:09.361
and then we sauteed it in some butter,

01:09.362 --> 01:11.421
and then we just cut all our veggies,

01:12.120 --> 01:14.760
all the tomatoes, cause they're so good right now.

01:14.761 --> 01:15.521
And then we assembled this.

01:15.522 --> 01:17.541
We got our pita, homemade hummus,

01:17.600 --> 01:18.960
loaded the veggies, meat,

01:18.961 --> 01:19.481
and, of course,

01:19.482 --> 01:20.501
lots of feta.

01:21.680 --> 01:22.360
Oh, man.

01:22.361 --> 01:24.201
And you guys. So good.

01:24.202 --> 01:27.701
It's our favorite. It's Both Daniel and I's one of our favorite foods.
