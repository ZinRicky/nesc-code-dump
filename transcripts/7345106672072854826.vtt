00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.960
Get ready with me

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.920
for the last day of Charleston Wine and Food Festival.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.000
This has been a whirlwind weekend,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.560
and honestly,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.280
the staff has had to pivot a couple of times

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.740
because of terrible weather here in Charleston.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.280
But that doesn't rain on our parade,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.560
because we are still going to the day party today,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.880
and we're gonna have a great time.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.400
This is my first year covering

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.640
the Charleston Wine and Food Festival as an influencer,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.520
and I couldn't be more excited.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.360
One of my favorite things about living in Charleston

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.480
is the food.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.320
In all honesty,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.000
if there's ever an event where they're like, hey,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.920
you can show up and drink wine and eat food,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.300
and it counts as work,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.600
I'm there today.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.520
My husband is coming with me to the day party,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.120
which is going to be held in Mount Pleasant

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.200
on the waterfront.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.440
Hopefully it's not gonna be too windy,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.920
because I have this cute little strawberry

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.900
hat that I've been wanting to wear all festival.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.500
You know your girl loves a theme.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.320
Besides all the fabulous food and drinks,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.240
I have really been enjoying meeting and hanging out

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.320
with some of my favorite influencers here in Charleston.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.680
There is such a sense of community amongst all of us.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.840
It is awesome to see.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.880
So although I'm tired,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.580
let's rally and have a great day.
