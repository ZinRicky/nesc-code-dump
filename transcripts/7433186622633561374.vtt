00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.960
your body wasn't designed to survive three Trump elections

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:06.000
but here are five really good reasons to remain hopeful

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:10.640
coming in at number one there is an unprecedented female voter turnout

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.640
everyone was saying this is a boy versus girl election

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:13.680
there's gonna be a huge gender gap

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:14.920
well as it turns out

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:16.760
women are outnumbering oh

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.660
women are outnumbering ha ha

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.460
it's a hard word women are outnumbering men by 10 points

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.780
and who are women more likely to support

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.700
Kamala Harris coming in at number two

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.240
the silver surge Pennsylvania voters

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:33.360
where I am talking to you from right now

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.280
especially our elders the seniors

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.720
have come out in droves to support Kamala Harris

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:41.660
even though as a demo they tend to lean Republican

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.040
grumpy old white man for the win

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:45.020
number Tres

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.600
No. 3 historical black voter turnout in Georgia

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:54.400
almost half of the state has already voted

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:57.180
which is good news for you guessed it

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.660
not the racist guy number quack cat

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.400
Pama Harris is closing in on Trump even in some deep red states like Texas

00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:05.880
she is in fact

00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:08.160
doing so well right now that she is positioned to have

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.880
the strongest democratic presidential performance

00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:12.680
since 1992 lastly

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:15.000
remember Tom's Coachella for racist rally

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:16.600
well in Pennsylvania

00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:21.180
there are half a million Puerto Ricans who will be voting

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.920
and reports are showing that uh

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:23.720
apparently uh

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:26.040
a lot of people don't like being called garbage

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:27.160
you know the comments are really racist

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:29.240
when Donald Trump acknowledges that they are racist

00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:31.548
so consider this list your mental health toolbox
