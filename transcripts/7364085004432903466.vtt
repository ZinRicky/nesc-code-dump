00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Hey, it's now a good time to talk.

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:05.481
I know we kinda argued before bed, and we, like,

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:06.601
tried to make up,

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:10.041
but it feels kinda like I feel now this morning.

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.321
Kinda like I just squashed some of my feelings

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:13.361
to kinda make it go away,

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:15.401
but they're still kinda bothering me.

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:17.981
And I was wondering if we could just talk, you know?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.140
So you're saying you lied to me last night?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.520
That's the real fucking issue.

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:26.821
You're constant fucking lying.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.680
You told me everything was okay.

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.121
You told me you forgave me,

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:32.121
and now we gotta bring it back up again.

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:34.121
Now we gotta do it all over again,

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:36.041
you know? You're never fucking happy.

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:39.481
I work my ass to the bone for this family,

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:40.621
and what do you do?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.120
Fucking complain all the fucking time?

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.321
Why don't you stay sitting on your ass all day

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:46.601
like I know you're gonna.

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:48.261
Well, I fucking work.
