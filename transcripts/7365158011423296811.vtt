00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.480
men don't understand women

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:02.201
and here's why

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:05.481
women are told to not be so demanding or she's called bossy

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:08.641
women are told to not be too loud or she's obnoxious

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.201
we're told not to be too much

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:14.121
we're afraid of causing bigger problems by stating our honest opinion

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:15.361
we're people pleasers

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:18.521
we're afraid to be Frank with someone and be honest with them

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:20.241
because we don't wanna hurt their feelings

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:21.481
might be generalizing here

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:25.281
but oftentimes women are raised to be polite and agreeable

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:29.161
that's why what we say doesn't actually mean what it does half the time

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:32.321
and that's why men find it so challenging to understand us

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:34.441
women are not necessarily playing games

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.441
we just find it hard to communicate with men

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:39.401
because we have been raised to be that way

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:41.621
afraid of using our voice

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.280
you as a man find it challenging to understand a woman

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:48.641
understanding this basic knowledge of a woman will get you so far in life

00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:50.601
you further than any other man really

00:00:50.602 --> 00:00:53.601
understanding that this is how women are raised

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:55.401
and this is why we're not straightforward

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:58.681
will help you when you want to understand a woman better

00:00:58.682 --> 00:01:01.281
I know we often want you to be mind readers

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:05.201
but I'm telling you exactly why we are the way we are

00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:06.601
why we're not straightforward

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:07.981
why we're not direct

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.060
not to be agreeable and nice

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.320
just like men are raised to be tough guys

00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:15.161
well women are raised to be nice and agreeable

00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:16.621
you don't understand a woman

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.659
reflect on this
