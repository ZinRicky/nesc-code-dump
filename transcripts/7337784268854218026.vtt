00:00.160 --> 00:02.480
The Asian grocery store is one of our favorite places.

00:02.480 --> 00:04.960
We just don't get to go a lot because it's so far.

00:04.960 --> 00:05.840
But when we do go,

00:05.840 --> 00:06.720
we stock up.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.080
So we always start in the produce section.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.480
I need to get papayas,

00:10.480 --> 00:11.440
some mushrooms,

00:11.440 --> 00:13.840
and then I browse all the green leafy vegetables.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.360
I decided to get some Guy Lawn today.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.400
I also got some bean sprouts and garlic.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.200
And then Lucky's always in charge of the meat.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.580
He always likes to stock up on some wagyu.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.600
And lucky needed to get this soda

00:24.600 --> 00:26.740
cause it looked really intriguing to him.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.920
We made it over to the ramen section,

00:28.920 --> 00:31.120
and there's two ramens we like to eat,

00:31.120 --> 00:32.600
so we got normal tonkatsu

00:32.600 --> 00:34.200
and then black garlic tonkatsu.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.400
And then I've been seeing these buldak ramens

00:36.400 --> 00:37.800
all over my for you page,

00:37.800 --> 00:40.020
but they didn't have the flavor I wanted,

00:40.160 --> 00:42.720
so I moved on and got some cucumber kimchi

00:42.720 --> 00:43.760
and normal kimchi.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.200
Also stocked up on some frozen udon.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.160
These spicy pork dumplings are so good.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.700
Stocked up on some gyoza

00:50.720 --> 00:53.400
and then some essential sauces that we ran out of.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.520
I was trying to find Boba ice cream

00:55.520 --> 00:57.760
and this viral mango ice cream.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.200
Couldn't find either of those,

00:59.200 --> 01:00.960
so we ended up leaving without it,

01:00.960 --> 01:02.540
which I was sad about.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.100
But this wraps up our trip.
