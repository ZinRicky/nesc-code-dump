00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.560
I see all the time those stories where people are like,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.440
oh, we were married for all these years,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.880
we broke up,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.600
got divorced,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.640
and then 15 years later we got remarried again.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.340
I do not ever see that happening in my situation. Ever.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.160
I don't believe in going in the past. I don't.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.580
I don't give a fuck what common thread we have together.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.800
We tried it,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.920
it didn't work.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.940
I don't know.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.080
No. Also for the confusion it would potentially cause

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.480
my children.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.600
I would never wanna have to put them through that twice.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.200
Do you know what I mean?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.640
So like, we were married,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.080
we had kids,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.560
we had a family,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.160
we broke up,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.360
everybody healed from that.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.680
To then get back together.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.480
At the risk of

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.200
then what if you break up again?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.060
Putting your kids through all that again?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.800
No, it's done.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.700
Enclosed. We're done,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.520
done, done, done.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.560
I hope one day we can be friends in cordial.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.000
Cause that would just be easy

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.200
since we literally have children in common.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.160
But as far as

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.060
ever being in a relationship with that person again,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.040
literally never.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.500
Over my fucking dead body.
