00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.160
stitch this and please explain to me what you mean by marriage is hard

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:06.880
I've touched on this topic so many times

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:09.120
that I have a playlist about marriage in my profile

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:10.520
I've been with my husband for 12 years

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:11.320
married for 10

00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:13.240
and my marriage is not hard

00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:15.080
life is hard

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.840
we've gone through UPS and downs with finances

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:18.920
we've gone through having three babies together

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:22.080
we've gone through me having postpartum anxiety and mental health issues

00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:23.200
we've gone through injuries

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:25.320
we've moved and renovated houses

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:26.040
but not once

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.480
during all of those hard moments

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:29.100
did I ever think gosh

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.280
being married is hard

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:31.280
in all honesty

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.680
if I hadn't been married

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:34.840
all of those things would have been about a million times harder

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:36.540
the caveat I think though

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.640
is that people get married for all sorts of reasons

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.640
and I have found that the relationship that I have with my husband

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:41.400
is the exception

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:42.040
not the rule

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.200
for one reason or another

00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:47.280
people marry people that they have a really hard time cohabitating with

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.160
and coexisting with for long term

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:52.320
and maybe their relationship was a struggle from the beginning or maybe

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:52.920
I don't know

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:54.000
people change and grow

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:54.920
and they don't grow together

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.640
they grow apart

00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.160
and that is totally possible

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.960
but the most beautiful thing in my life is my marriage

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.680
we have grown together through each stage of being together

00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:04.120
and I hope we have nice

00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:06.320
long lives that we continue to grow and change

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:07.460
and support each other

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.360
because we are each other's best friends and biggest supporters

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:14.360
and there's nothing better in this life than going through it with somebody who

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:16.800
you know is always going to be your person

00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:20.126
so no I can't relate to marriage being hard either
