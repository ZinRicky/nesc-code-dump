My husband's about to go on a 25 hour road trip,

00:02.881 --> 00:06.001
so I decided to make him some bubblegum lollipops

00:06.002 --> 00:08.041
as a little treat on his drive.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.081
Started out by making my bubblegum

00:10.082 --> 00:12.881
by spreading some powdered sugar on some wax paper,

00:12.882 --> 00:14.561
melting down my gum base,

00:14.562 --> 00:17.581
transferring that into the middle of my mounts I created.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.120
I added some apple flavor to one of them

00:20.121 --> 00:23.001
and added some vanilla extract to the other

00:23.002 --> 00:25.121
to make two different kinds of flavors

00:25.122 --> 00:27.921
before kneading in my powdered sugar.

00:27.922 --> 00:29.841
Once a good portion of them was absorbed,

00:29.842 --> 00:32.801
I cut them up and formed them into little gumballs

00:32.802 --> 00:37.181
before putting them aside while I got started on making my lollipops.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.440
Obviously had to try one and make sure that it was the right

00:40.441 --> 00:42.341
consistency, which it was.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.480
Then moved on to making my lollipops

00:44.481 --> 00:47.001
by combining some sugar and syrup in a pot

00:47.002 --> 00:49.601
before placing that on my stove to boil.

00:49.602 --> 00:50.201
In the meantime,

00:50.202 --> 00:53.081
I put my gumballs on top of my lollipop sticks

00:53.082 --> 00:56.201
before checking on my sugar mixture on the stove.

00:56.202 --> 00:59.481
Wanted to keep a close eye on it to make sure it reached the right

00:59.482 --> 01:02.081
temperature for adding in some more apple syrup

01:02.082 --> 01:03.321
and green food colouring

01:03.322 --> 01:06.181
since I was making apple flavoured lollipops.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.160
Once it reached the hard crack stage,

01:08.161 --> 01:10.641
I transferred it over to my silicone molds

01:10.642 --> 01:13.521
before placing my lollipop sticks inside.

01:13.522 --> 01:15.001
Speed up the cooling process.

01:15.002 --> 01:16.241
I placed them in the fridge

01:16.242 --> 01:18.521
and then had lucky Get them out of the molds,

01:18.522 --> 01:19.801
because I couldn't,

01:19.802 --> 01:20.921
for some reason.

01:20.922 --> 01:23.841
Got them out and couldn't contain his excitement.

01:23.842 --> 01:27.421
So he tried one of them and absolutely love them.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.256
Wrapped up the other one so he could take them on his road trip.
