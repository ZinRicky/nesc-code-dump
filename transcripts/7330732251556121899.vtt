00:00.160 --> 00:00.680
The other day,

00:00.680 --> 00:03.600
I tried putting on some denim that I would always wear,

00:03.600 --> 00:05.940
and it wouldn't even come past my thighs.

00:06.040 --> 00:09.120
That's how I know that I've hit 30 weeks pregnancy,

00:09.120 --> 00:11.760
and I don't fit any of my clothes anymore.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.480
We used to get dressed together a lot,

00:13.480 --> 00:17.400
so I'm back to show you one of my pregnancy outfits.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.520
I checked on this white blouse and some white

00:20.520 --> 00:22.240
stretchy pants. Obviously,

00:22.240 --> 00:24.480
I've been obsessed with wearing my Birkenstocks.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.080
And then I layered my jewelry

00:26.080 --> 00:29.180
and popped on this brown leather Bottega bag.
