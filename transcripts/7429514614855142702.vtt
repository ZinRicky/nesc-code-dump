00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.040
they were looking at the research that has demonstrated that in this election

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.000
young men are increasingly leaning right

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:12.800
while young women are increasingly leaning left

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:15.440
and how young men but not young women

00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:17.260
are gravitating towards religion

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.960
and they were like oh

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:19.840
why could this be like

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:21.520
I'll give you a hint 

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:22.720
it rhymes with 

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:23.760
schmishogony 

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.240
then they interview a lot of these 

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:27.240
young men and women to learn more about like

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.360
tell us about your politics

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.960
what issues are important to you

00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:33.400
and they draw out that one of the key themes amongst these young men

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
meanwhile the women were like

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:48.280
I'm really worried about sexism

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.320
I'm worried about the rhetoric

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm worried about them taking away my rights

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.240
I'm worried about my health care

00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:53.000
and the episode 

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.920
treated these like these were two separate things

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.880
they were like well

00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:58.280
the young women are really concerned about sexism

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:00.920
and young men today just don't really know their place

00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:02.760
and their longing for traditional values

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:08.480
since when have we rebranded misogyny as traditional values

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:11.120
these young men were pretty blatantly like

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:15.020
I want a woman to stay home like the good old days

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.740
does no one know anything about history

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.480
why women needed to be with men

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:22.420
why all women were in the home

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.040
why all of them were doing unpaid domestic labor

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.520
I'm not at all knocking stay at home parents

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:29.040
but they weren't saying

00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:33.120
we should have an economy where one of the parents can stay home

00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:38.260
they were all very specific about how that person should be a woman

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.440
and how JD Vance

00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:43.240
and Trump are running this traditional values campaign that really values that

00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:46.620
it's like it it's just misogyny???

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.120
literally saying on the one hand

00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:51.480
we wanna force women to do reproductive labor against their will

00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:56.300
and also we're really longing for that time when all women were in the home
