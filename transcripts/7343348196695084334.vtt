00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.040
Being a stay at home mom is a job.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.720
Being a stay at home wife is a job.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.600
Taking care of the house

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.160
while your husband provides for you is a job.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.760
So when a woman stays at home

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.560
while her husband provides for her and isn't working,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.440
she is working

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.360
and her husband is covering the cost of that work.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.360
When you pay a nanny to take care of your kids,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.000
when you drop your kids off at daycare

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.880
and pay the daycare,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.160
when you pay a housekeeper,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.920
a house manager,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.040
to take care of the house,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.560
that's considered work.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.360
All of the work that those people are doing

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.320
is considered work.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.000
But when a woman who stays at home does it,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.680
it's not work.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.840
No, very much is work,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.439
and it's hard work.
