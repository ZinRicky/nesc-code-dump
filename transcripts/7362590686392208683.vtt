00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.440
So I just got back from a girls trip to Charleston,

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:06.941
South Carolina and while I had a really great time,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.620
I was astounded by the amount of non masculine men

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.120
that I was surrounded by the whole time that I was there.

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.121
I'm not saying there weren't any masculine men,

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:22.721
but there were so many and I'm not used to that.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:27.621
I'm from a farm community where men are very masculine and capable

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.220
and you know I felt so unsafe.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.760
And I don't mean because I hate them,

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:34.941
that's not what I mean.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.120
But if something catastrophic were to happen I just felt like who.

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:46.701
Who's gonna step up to the plate and like um, be responsible?

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.480
Who's going to be brave and like

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:52.021
stand up if something bad were to happen?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.100
And I just felt like it just felt scary in a way to me. And

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.700
I was just thinking about it like

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.240
I am not gonna go to another female

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:09.481
when something bad or scary happens in my life.

00:01:09.482 --> 00:01:11.481
I'm not gonna want them helping me.

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:12.681
I want a strong,

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:13.401
capable,

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:18.421
brave masculine man that I know can get the job done there to help me.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.800
And it was so relieving to come home to my own wonderful husband

00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:26.201
and just be here in this farm community again

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:29.061
where I know that's the way of life.
