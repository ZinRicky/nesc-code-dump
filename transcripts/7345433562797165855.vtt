00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.800
Let's make my blue collar husband's lunch.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.400
I'm making a chicken Alfredo sandwich with bacon.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.680
And one way to make sure the breads does not get soggy

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.880
is I toast it in a cast iron skillet.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.240
They do is just take shredded chicken,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.160
some Alfredo sauce

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.400
and slap your mama seasoning and mix that all together.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.320
Chop up your bacon and add it to the mixture.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.460
Assemble together your sandwich and you're good to go.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.040
Lunches really do not have to be gourmet.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.720
They really can be as simple as this.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.140
And man, are they delicious.
