00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.000
when people want to make women feel small or to shut them up

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.201
they will attack their looks

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:11.101
because they believe that a woman's power is solely tied to her appearance

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.720
now in some ways they're right

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.001
because in the world we live in

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.481
beauty absolutely is a currency of power

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.141
but the funny thing is

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.440
women are taught from a young age not to take ownership of that power

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:25.201
I always think of that one direction song

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:26.841
she don't know she's beautiful

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.421
that's what makes her beautiful

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.040
because we don't want women to feel or own their power

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:35.681
a woman's beauty and her sexuality actually also should be given to her

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:38.841
or bestowed upon her by the opinions of others

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.021
a resource for someone else to yield

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.800
after all a beautiful wife is a status symbol for her husband

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:45.041
is it not sorry

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.461
I'm rewatching Bridgerton

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.740
so I really think that the most powerful thing a beautiful woman can do

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.800
is know that she's beautiful

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:56.101
because when your beauty is self defined

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.480
it can stop being used as a weapon to be used against you

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:00.321
because truly

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:01.041
in an argument

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:03.301
if somebody starts going after your looks

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.740
they've already lost the point anyway

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.640
and they're trying to make you feel less powerful

00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:09.401
so they can get the upper hand again

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:15.581
after all someone else's opinion on your appearance doesn't matter
