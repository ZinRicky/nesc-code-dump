00:00.400 --> 00:02.120
I think it is interesting how

00:02.120 --> 00:04.000
men can watch their favorite athletes

00:04.000 --> 00:05.360
compete in all kinds of sports

00:05.360 --> 00:07.320
and cheer for them and be inspired by them,

00:07.320 --> 00:09.360
but when women see other successful women,

00:09.360 --> 00:12.000
we tend to see them as a personal attack on us.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.880
Like, I've never heard of a man watch the NBA

00:14.880 --> 00:15.760
and then complain

00:15.760 --> 00:18.480
that the players are setting unrealistic expectations

00:18.480 --> 00:19.640
of how men should look

00:19.640 --> 00:20.960
and that men should be a certain height.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.440
But when it comes to Hannah from Ballerina Farms,

00:23.440 --> 00:25.780
I get so many comments from people saying, well,

00:25.920 --> 00:28.160
she's setting unrealistic expectations for women.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.360
Like, what does that even mean?

00:29.360 --> 00:30.960
We have this thing in this day and age

00:30.960 --> 00:32.200
where we feel like we are

00:32.200 --> 00:34.160
entitled to look out into the world,

00:34.160 --> 00:35.880
to look on social media,

00:35.880 --> 00:37.240
to look in the regular media,

00:37.240 --> 00:39.760
and see ourselves reflected back to us.

00:39.760 --> 00:40.920
Like, we personally

00:40.920 --> 00:43.660
need to be represented in every area of life.

00:43.680 --> 00:44.680
And if there is a woman

00:44.680 --> 00:46.320
who is doing something different than us,

00:46.320 --> 00:48.980
if she is more successful at us in a certain way,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.580
um, then that is a personal attack on us,

00:51.680 --> 00:54.280
and it is setting unrealistic expectations for us,

00:54.280 --> 00:56.120
and it's just designed to make us feel bad.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.840
And it's such a narcissistic

00:57.840 --> 00:59.880
and just miserable way to view the world.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.400
Like, you don't have to think that way.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.160
It's very freeing to let go of that

01:03.160 --> 01:05.080
and to just let people be successful

01:05.080 --> 01:06.040
and find it interesting.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.560
That some people are born,

01:07.560 --> 01:09.680
you know, seven feet tall and can play in the NBA,

01:09.680 --> 01:10.280
and that's cool,

01:10.280 --> 01:10.920
and I'm not,

01:10.920 --> 01:11.734
and that's okay.
