00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.200
My husband has been asking me to make him Oreos for a while now,

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:05.161
but I finally decided to make some

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:07.721
because I wanted my kids to know what an Oreo is.

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:09.681
I don't trust any of the ultra processed

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:11.481
snack foods for my growing children's health,

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:13.281
which is why I'm making them from scratch

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:15.521
using an ancient wheat as the base of the cookie cookie.

00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:18.161
I'm using iron corn wheat because it has so much flavor,

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:20.841
satisfies, and hasn't been altered in the lab like modern wheat.

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:23.681
I gradually added in my flour and black cacao powder

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:25.241
to ensure the cookies would be black

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:26.121
rather than brown.

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:29.641
Since I used only four tablespoons of unrefined coconut sugar,

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:31.261
the dough wasn't sweet at all,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.840
but that's fine because the filling would be rather sweet.

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:37.441
After rolling it out between two pieces of unbleached Parchment paper

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:39.161
to a 1/4 inch thickness,

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.601
I used a circular cookie cutter to shape each cookie.

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:43.681
I then carefully peeled off the leftover dough

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:45.641
and used it to make the remaining cookies

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:49.201
while those baked at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 13 ish minutes.

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:52.781
I prepared the filling using 100% pasture raised raw butter

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.280
homemade on my parents farm,

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.361
combined with maple sugar and vanilla to make a fluffy such a filling!

00:00:57.362 --> 00:01:00.241
Now don't let anyone tell you that homemade frosting isn't better!

00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:01.761
The final part of this recipe

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:02.121
included

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:05.861
piping the frosting into the center of my fully cooled Oreo cookies.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.200
This part was really exciting

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.801
But I had to contain myself since the cookies were fragile.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.641
I had just picked the girls up from school,

00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:13.481
so they were keen to try the Oreos, too.

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:15.321
And I couldn't help dancing to Backstreet Boys.

00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:17.821
That my five year old somehow is into right now.
