00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.120
I wanted to open up a discussion,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.080
open up a dialogue,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.380
I think, on the track wife culture.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.000
And this stems primarily from Founders Ministry

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.240
last week had,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.980
or at least posted a video, um,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.240
of a snippet of their content,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.580
of their panel that they did with Ali Best Ducky.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.480
And this is not.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.520
I'm not dissing Ali best Becky,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.680
but I do have some things to say.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.960
So her primary goal was to say that tradwave, um,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.220
content is not biblical womanhood or biblical wifehood,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.600
which is true,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.400
and if she would have just stopped there.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.520
Hundred percent true.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.320
It's not. Oh, it.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.540
They're not always conflated together. Um,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.480
you can be a Christian

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.400
and you can be a traditional wife,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.360
but there's also traditional wives

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.200
who aren't Christians.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.360
However, she goes into the fact that tradwife aesthetics

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.200
are merely just cosplaying,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.660
or at least she insinuated that.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.560
Aesthetics or just cosplaying.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.720
But I would like to say,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.740
like, my life that I post on here

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.520
most of the time,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.960
unless it's like

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.120
a specific type of content,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.440
is 100% what I am doing throughout the day.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.600
I wear dresses

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.360
and I do bake bread quite often

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.940
or bake goodies quite often,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.560
and I make content. Um,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.620
revolving that,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.260
she then went on to say that,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.880
you know, your favorite influencer is telling you that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.040
if you don't make sourdough,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.060
you're a bad mom.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.520
Not once has I,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.280
have I ever seen somebody flat out say that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.400
if You don't make sourdough,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.360
then you're a bad mom.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.880
And honestly,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.120
if you are saying that,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.960
that's ridiculous

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.480
and you just stop.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.880
It's kind of lumping

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.800
the entire niche into one single category,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.640
which I don't think is okay to do.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.080
Other things in the Tradwife movement

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.640
that are not necessarily biblical

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.880
and could be corrected

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.240
absolutely 100%.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.280
But that is with anything.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.400
And it is such a fringe topic to be attacking

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.560
at a Founders Ministry thing.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.600
I would like to argue that most Christian women

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.500
are not in danger of becoming a traditional wife.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.780
Quite the opposite.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.700
But every other niche has an aesthetic.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.840
And no one else says anything about the other topics

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.240
that have aesthetics to them.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.960
Aesthetics are a way of showing beauty,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.680
and it's a way of showing God's beauty

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.840
and within the home.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.240
If you want relatable mom content

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.640
where women are in messy buns and like

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.560
an Adam Sandler outfits,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.080
that's great.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.880
That's out there

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.860
and that is available to you.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.460
Um, if you want the more

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.120
quote unquote

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.480
relatable content,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.120
a lot of beauty in the home

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.080
that is so easily overlooked

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.960
and is so easily dismissed.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.080
And so a movement like the tribe by movement

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.180
who is promoting these feminine beauty aesthetics,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.280
there's nothing inherently wrong with that.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.160
And no one is saying

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.020
this is the standard you have to meet.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.260
If someone is making you feel

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.360
on social media

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.960
as like if they are the creator

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.520
and they are making

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.860
You feel like you have to live up to their standard.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.720
That is not on the creator.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.280
That is you putting standards on yourself

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.800
that are perceived.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.280
And I tell you right now,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.660
if you have that,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.920
ever felt that,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.760
go and ask your husband

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.380
what his expectations are of you.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.800
Because I personally

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.400
like sharing things I do in my home

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400
as encouragement.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.640
Not ever to be like,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.200
oh, look at me,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.000
I'm superior to you.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.080
That is never, ever,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.040
ever what I wanna get across.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.160
It is just simply to encourage you

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.600
in the excellence of the home.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.880
There's so much diversity

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.520
between each and every one of our lives.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.640
We each have our own style.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.560
We each have our own aesthetic

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.000
within this own aesthetic,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.060
if that makes sense.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.880
And your life does not have to look

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.860
like somebody you see on social media

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.040
is what happens

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.780
is that the mainstream media takes

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.000
images of people

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.120
and portrays that as the face of the tribe

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.680
by movement,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.300
when in reality, it's not.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320
And that's a media issue

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.800
that's not on the content creator.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.520
Anyways, I would love to hear your thoughts,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.360
comments, ideas, um,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.280
about this topic.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.620
And also, if you want to go listen to

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.120
the, uh, panel,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.611
I highly recommend doing that as well.
