00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.560
Comparing women to men

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.060
is like comparing almonds to cows.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.960
Stay with me.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.200
Calling it chest feeding is like calling it almond milk.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.860
It's almond juice.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.380
Juice from an almond?

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.500
Since when did nuts have nipples?

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.540
Oh yeah, you can milk anything with nipples.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.020
They are confusing you as a consumer

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.200
and ill informed consumer

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.640
to consume juice from an almond

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.580
as if it is the same damn thing as the milk from a cow.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.300
Because we all know they don't want us eating real food.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.920
But what we don't realize is

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.000
us women are constantly being mine.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.500
F by wordplay.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.500
Feminism degrades the out of women.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.920
If a man can just choose to be a woman,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.760
choose to breastfeed a child,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.600
if this he says their milk is just as viable as ours,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.880
then what the hell are women good for? Y'all?

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.640
I just can't.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.320
It's too late.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.580
My brain is just blue.
