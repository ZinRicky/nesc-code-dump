00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Is anyone else deep into Nail TikTok at the moment?

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:05.001
Specifically gel x Nail TikTok?

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:08.521
Because I am and I'm also extremely fucking delusional.

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:10.681
So I don't need encouragement

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:14.641
to try and learn something that I'm not remotely qualified to do

00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:17.361
after watching hours and hours of these girly pops

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:20.681
doing the most gorgeous nails from the comfort of their own home.

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:21.481
And can I just say

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:23.841
they sold me at the fact that they don't have to leave the house

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:26.721
because one thing about me is I genuinely don't like doing that.

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:29.841
That's why you don't get fun Errands day vlogs from me because errands,

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:32.161
I think that they're a chore and I don't really like that.

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:32.681
One night

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.321
I went on to Amazon and I bought everything that I needed to do

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:37.361
to do my own gel X at home.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:39.801
The first set that I did was just a plain one colour.

00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:43.681
I just wanted to take it easy and learn the process and they were okay.

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:46.461
I definitely had some areas that I could improve it. Anyway,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.760
I fell in love with mermaid nails.

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:50.841
I don't know if you've seen those,

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.361
but they're just ethereal.

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:56.401
My inner child screams with delight every time I see them and I'm like,

00:00:56.402 --> 00:00:58.461
I want those on my hands.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.240
And so the other night I decided to give them a go.

00:01:01.241 --> 00:01:04.121
And this is your sign if you're thinking about doing your own gel X,

00:01:04.122 --> 00:01:05.561
doing them at home because this

00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:07.081
Is my first attempt at nail art

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:10.661
and I feel like it's only gonna get better from here

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.760
and I lowkey aye like these nails make me so fucking happy

00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:19.601
and I think that that is the point right

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:21.301
they might not be your cup of tea

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.440
they might not even be my cup of tea in two weeks

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:26.001
I'm gonna wanna change them because that's what I do with nails

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.641
I get sick of them but for today I'm so happy okay

00:01:29.642 --> 00:01:30.481
I will show you what I did

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:33.041
because I'm proud of myself for trying these things

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:34.961
I did an aura now with chrome

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:37.841
and then we've got the water droplets with the nail glue

00:01:37.842 --> 00:01:39.801
then this one is blooming gel

00:01:39.802 --> 00:01:42.041
I've done a little swirl moment with a few different colours

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:43.701
and we've also got the water droplets

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.120
this one is a blooming gel with a chrome moment and there is um

00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:49.201
sorry for pulling the fingers

00:01:49.202 --> 00:01:50.161
there's a pearl at the bottom

00:01:50.162 --> 00:01:53.361
this one's just like a plain pink with a couple of pearls

00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:56.501
couple of water droplets and a starfish stop

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.400
and then I'm quite happy with this one

00:01:58.401 --> 00:02:01.801
it's mainly chrome but then I did some blooming gel down the bottom

00:02:01.802 --> 00:02:03.841
and we've got water droplets and we got starfish

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:08.801
and honestly these just make me feel like a magical sea creature

00:02:08.802 --> 00:02:11.601
and why wouldn't you wanna feel like that?

00:02:11.602 --> 00:02:15.001
I've linked everything that I used in my Amazon storefront

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:16.101
but honestly

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.340
if you Have been thinking about trying your own gel X at home.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.680
I think you should. I think you should fucking go for it

00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:23.801
because the amount of compliments I've had on my nails as well,

00:02:23.802 --> 00:02:25.461
I'm like, really?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.900
Thank you. I did them myself.
