I bought this dress back in January

00:02.121 --> 00:03.961
with the intention of wearing it for summer,

00:03.962 --> 00:05.761
and now Summer's here.

00:05.762 --> 00:07.721
Best thing I've ever gotten off of TikTok.

00:07.722 --> 00:10.721
It's so cute. I'm 5 foot 5, and it's very,

00:10.722 --> 00:11.321
very long on me.

00:11.322 --> 00:12.001
I'm wearing these,

00:12.002 --> 00:14.461
like, big heels just so I can show you.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.420
Super cute. Ignore the neighbor's dog.

00:17.640 --> 00:18.240
They're, like,

00:18.241 --> 00:19.521
playing out there and barking a bunch.

00:19.522 --> 00:21.761
But amazing dress.

00:21.762 --> 00:24.441
I love it. It ties right here.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.201
And you can change it so you can, like,

00:26.202 --> 00:27.161
tie it a different way.

00:27.162 --> 00:27.961
I've seen girls do it,

00:27.962 --> 00:29.701
like, up the middle.

00:29.760 --> 00:30.880
Um, yeah.

00:30.881 --> 00:32.081
I just love it so much.

00:32.082 --> 00:34.041
I think every girl needs it for summer.
