00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
if you've been following along with this series

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:03.303
and you've ever wondered why it's 

00:00:03.304 --> 00:00:04.281
taking me over a week

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:05.739
to deep clean my entire kitchen 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.241
this is why

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:07.401
this is how I left it last night

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:09.081
and this is how we're looking this morning

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:10.641
granted I did have my nephew and niece 

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:12.201
staying alongside my own three children

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:14.241
but still I'm literally pushing 💩 up hill here

00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:15.121
I feel like every day

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:16.837
I've been showing up in this kitchen and 

00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:17.801
taking one step forward & 10 steps back

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:19.721
but that's okay

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:21.279
it's not like my sanity is hinging 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.481
on the progress that I make

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:23.521
in this room or anything

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:24.401
So quick backstory

00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:26.501
I've decided that this month is gonna be the 

00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:27.761
ultimate reset month for me

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:29.961
getting around to all the jobs that have been on my to do list

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.281
and I am deep cleaning

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:34.521
deep cluttering and organising every space in the main area of my home

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:35.761
I started off with the bathroom

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:36.841
we have one bathroom

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.921
which we're sharing at the moment between five of us

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.361
and that took me hours

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:41.081
hours and hours

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.756
but it was worth it because now we have 

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:44.181
some systems and some organisation

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.760
and then I set my sights on the kitchen

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:46.761
I started with the fridge

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:48.001
and I did that one afternoon

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:48.521
the next day

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:50.161
all I managed to do was the freezer

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:50.881
the day after that

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:53.041
I deep cleaned the pantry and pulled everything out

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:53.921
and the following day

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:55.881
I managed to restock and put it all back together

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:56.561
the day after that

00:00:56.562 --> 00:00:58.641
I deep cleaned the exterior of this kitchen

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.281
and that involved taking everything off

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:00.961
every surface

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:02.841
and then steaming it within an inch of its life

00:01:02.842 --> 00:01:03.881
we're on the home stretch now

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:06.105
because the only task left to do is to clean out 

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:07.241
20 drawers and a cupboard

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:09.040
then put them all back together again 

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:09.561
so you know

00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:10.201
not that much

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:11.641
and how am I feeling emotionally?

00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:12.761
thank you so much for asking

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:13.561
well last night

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:15.681
those five kids just would not go to sleep

00:01:15.682 --> 00:01:16.401
for the life of me

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:17.681
so I'm feeling quite tired

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:18.481
I'm also feeling like

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:20.721
I'm really looking forward to the school term starting again

00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:22.681
they've been on holidays for 36 days

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:24.041
and we've got 15 more to go

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:25.841
not that I've been counting or anything

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:28.601
and I'm also getting pretty sick of just standing here in this kitchen

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:29.121
if I'm honest

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:29.921
so I've decided

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:31.041
come hell or high water

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:33.041
we are getting this job completed today

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:34.161
to set the scene for you

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:36.161
it's a really hot day here in Aotearoa 

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.281
New Zealand and currently

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:40.041
all I can hear is the beautiful songs of native birds,

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:42.021
cicadas and the whooping and hollering of 

00:01:42.022 --> 00:01:43.201
my brother and my husband

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:45.281
who are two different people by the way

00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:46.681
while they're playing outside

00:01:46.682 --> 00:01:48.161
carefree in the pool with the kids

00:01:48.162 --> 00:01:49.201
and all I can think is

00:01:49.202 --> 00:01:51.521
I'm standing in this hot kitchen with my sore feet

00:01:51.522 --> 00:01:53.001
sweating my non existent 🍒 off

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.441
you bastards

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:55.401
I'm mostly joking

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:58.201
but also how nice would it be to be a dad for just like one day

00:01:58.202 --> 00:01:59.161
anyway inevitably

00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:01.121
somebody's gonna tell me that my drawers are really full

00:02:01.122 --> 00:02:02.761
and I have a lot of stuff and like

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:03.441
you're not wrong

00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:05.561
but also this kitchen is smaller than my last

00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:06.721
so we built this little cabinet

00:02:06.722 --> 00:02:08.281
and today I'm gonna finally stock her

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:09.881
but first I'm gonna have a little sit down 

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:10.961
because I'm literally cooking

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:12.161
When restocking the glasses

00:02:12.162 --> 00:02:14.241
I realised just how many have been broken lately

00:02:14.242 --> 00:02:15.441
We’ve hosted a lot lately

00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:17.081
and I feel like every time people come over

00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:17.881
something gets broken

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:20.681
but I didn't realise just how many until I restocked that drawer

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.610
so I'm definitely gonna add “buy cute glasses”

00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:23.785
 to my list of things to do 

00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:24.121
question

00:02:24.122 --> 00:02:25.441
do all of your mugs match each other?

00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:27.161
or have you got an eclectic mix like me?

00:02:27.162 --> 00:02:27.721
I kinda like that

00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:28.561
they're all different though

00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:31.281
because I can pick any of those up and tell your story about it

00:02:31.282 --> 00:02:33.521
like there's one mug in there that my husband had as a baby

00:02:33.522 --> 00:02:35.681
and there's another mug in there that I bought 12 years ago

00:02:35.682 --> 00:02:36.881
when my first baby was a baby

00:02:36.882 --> 00:02:38.241
and that's why I can't part with them

00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:39.361
because they're sentimental

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:40.601
I like things that have stories

00:02:40.602 --> 00:02:42.121
I actually just like stories in general

00:02:42.122 --> 00:02:43.081
I'll tell you another story

00:02:43.082 --> 00:02:44.961
so that you're not too worried about me standing in this

00:02:44.962 --> 00:02:45.801
hot kitchen all day

00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:47.121
because full transparency

00:02:47.122 --> 00:02:49.321
this whole day did take me about seven hours

00:02:49.322 --> 00:02:50.441
so when I was about halfway through

00:02:50.442 --> 00:02:51.761
I decided I was really hungry

00:02:51.762 --> 00:02:53.121
and so I made a sandwich

00:02:53.122 --> 00:02:55.161
but we had absolutely no bench space right

00:02:55.162 --> 00:02:57.001
all of the stuff that I pulled out of the drawers

00:02:57.002 --> 00:02:58.241
immediately went onto the bench

00:02:58.242 --> 00:02:59.921
so I had to make a hand sandwich

00:02:59.922 --> 00:03:01.601
not to be confused with a ham sandwich

00:03:01.602 --> 00:03:03.524
but a hand sandwich is a sandwich that you 

00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:05.001
have to make and hold in one hand

00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:06.081
holding it and building it

00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:06.601
and eating it

00:03:06.602 --> 00:03:07.761
and I was making such a mess

00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:08.521
but oh my goodness

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.881
that sandwich was the best sandwich I think I've ever had

00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:11.721
she hit the spot

00:03:11.722 --> 00:03:13.641
and then I snuck away and put my togs on

00:03:13.642 --> 00:03:14.681
and I say snuck away

00:03:14.682 --> 00:03:16.161
because those three kids I mentioned

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:17.481
if they see me in my togs

00:03:17.482 --> 00:03:18.719
you are guaranteed that they are gonna 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.641
wanna hop in the pool with me

00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:21.481
and this sounds kind of selfish

00:03:21.482 --> 00:03:22.401
and I don't mean it to be

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:22.961
but honestly

00:03:22.962 --> 00:03:24.121
I was so hot and bothered

00:03:24.122 --> 00:03:25.161
I just needed a minute

00:03:25.162 --> 00:03:26.241
I needed to cool my core

00:03:26.242 --> 00:03:26.801
temperature down

00:03:26.802 --> 00:03:28.401
decompress and be left the hell alone

00:03:28.402 --> 00:03:30.681
so I stole a minute for a solo swim and my God

00:03:30.682 --> 00:03:31.161
it was amazing

00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:32.001
but then when I got back

00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:33.481
the taragon decided to test me

00:03:33.482 --> 00:03:34.681
so that was fun anyway

00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:35.481
so I'm trying to label

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:36.681
all of these little jars right

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:38.441
and I'm debating whether or not to tell you this

00:03:38.442 --> 00:03:39.801
because it's quite embarrassing

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:41.321
but also it's real life so go on

00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:42.681
so I've had these little jars

00:03:42.682 --> 00:03:43.801
for over 3 years

00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:45.281
and I have never labelled them 🙈

00:03:45.282 --> 00:03:46.241
so when I'm cooking

00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:47.041
I just rifle

00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:48.901
throw and sniff them all until I find the

00:03:48.902 --> 00:03:50.081
 one that I'm looking for 🙈🙈

00:03:50.082 --> 00:03:51.681
and it is not an effective workflow

00:03:51.682 --> 00:03:54.161
so I'm so pleased that their job is finally done

00:03:54.162 --> 00:03:55.201
you're allowed to judge me

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:56.241
it's fine I'm judging

00:03:56.242 --> 00:03:57.241
on the topic of labels

00:03:57.242 --> 00:03:59.601
somebody commented on my label making video that they were

00:03:59.602 --> 00:04:00.641
concerned that I put the labels

00:04:00.642 --> 00:04:01.121
on the bottom

00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:02.441
and that I wouldn't be able to see them

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.241
but I can see them on the bottom in the pantry

00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:05.421
just not in the spice drawer 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.400
which is why I labelled

00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:06.961
them on the lid

00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:07.801
so that when I open it

00:04:07.802 --> 00:04:09.041
I know what the fkn I'm cooking with

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:09.601
oh my goodness

00:04:09.602 --> 00:04:10.321
I think we're done

00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:12.321
and I'm so happy with how this cabinet turned out

00:04:12.322 --> 00:04:13.161
Got my fancy plates

00:04:13.162 --> 00:04:13.921
fancy glasses

00:04:13.922 --> 00:04:14.921
and some servingware 

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:16.081
alongside my cleaning stuff

00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:17.201
because they don't fit in the drawer

00:04:17.202 --> 00:04:17.841
and on this side

00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:18.601
we've got a cocktail

00:04:18.602 --> 00:04:19.201
making section

00:04:19.202 --> 00:04:20.361
and my small appliances

00:04:20.362 --> 00:04:22.241
so that I don't need to try and jam them into the drawer

00:04:22.242 --> 00:04:23.641
and if you're like me

00:04:23.642 --> 00:04:25.001
which I'm assuming that you are

00:04:25.002 --> 00:04:25.681
if you watched

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:26.481
until this point

00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:28.681
then I don't need to tell you how good this feeling is

00:04:28.682 --> 00:04:29.161
just knowing

00:04:29.162 --> 00:04:30.081
that every surface

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:31.161
has been sanitised

00:04:31.162 --> 00:04:31.721
every cupboard

00:04:31.722 --> 00:04:33.361
and every drawer has been organised

00:04:33.362 --> 00:04:34.801
the pantry has been done

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.736
the freezer and it's not gonna last 

00:04:36.737 --> 00:04:37.161
obviously

00:04:37.162 --> 00:04:38.081
but for right now

00:04:38.082 --> 00:04:38.921
it has scratched my

00:04:38.922 --> 00:04:40.281
brain in just the right way

00:04:40.282 --> 00:04:41.641
I asked my husband to do the oven

00:04:41.642 --> 00:04:42.961
because I thought he could do something

00:04:42.962 --> 00:04:43.899
and looking at it now 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.521
I'm gonna have to do it again aren't I

00:04:45.522 --> 00:04:47.001
and if you've made it to the end of my

00:04:47.002 --> 00:04:47.801
longest ever TikTok
