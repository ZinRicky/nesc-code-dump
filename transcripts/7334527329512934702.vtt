00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.760
Everyone to make sourdough bread,

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.720
but just totally overwhelmed

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.100
with how complicated it seems.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.240
On fermentation.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.400
Banatin basket,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.820
sourdough hydration.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.480
Something. A different language here.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.400
That must have items that you need to make sourdough.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.180
Something to stir your bread with,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.300
something to weigh your dough.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.320
I wouldn't recommend using cups,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.620
because it's not accurate enough.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.120
Some sort of bowl to mix your dough.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.520
Now, whatever.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.800
Starter. Now,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.960
this might seem dolting,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.400
but it's just water and flour

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.380
that's fermented. Put a salt.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.400
My water comes out the faucet.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.480
Nasty and full of chlorine.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.840
So I use filtered water.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.880
Flour. I'm using bleach.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.040
Walnut Valley flour,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.660
because I can.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.560
You don't need to buy fancy flowers

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.480
when you first starting out.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.960
And this is the flower I have right home right now.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.160
So that's what I'm gonna use.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.200
I'm gonna 0 it out,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.480
and I'm gonna make sure we're in ground.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.500
I'm gonna measure 650 grams of water.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.420
The dog hair in here.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.760
Life was just dog hair.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.120
Then I put 200 grams of starter in there.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.660
This is my sourdough starter.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.100
Smells like paint stripper,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.580
and it's nice and bubbly.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.040
People will say that you use.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.560
You need to use sourdough starter.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.080
At its peak. Um,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.320
I've used sourdough starter.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.760
Out the fridge.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.600
Has been sitting in the fridge for four or five days.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.080
I've used sourdough starter ice bag.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.240
Just an hour before.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.320
I've used sourdough starter.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.440
That I haven't felt for a few days.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.000
And just sitting

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.920
Out on the counter.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.640
Um, to me, it hasn't really made that much difference.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.480
You just need a.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.180
An established sourdough starter.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.760
2:11, 2:12. As I said,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.800
I'm not trying to get it as close as possible,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.520
but it's. It's fine.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.200
It's gonna be okay.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.720
Now I'm just gonna mix this up a little bit

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.040
just to incorporate the sourdough starter in this.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.720
I just remembered that I'm using a bowl of

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.660
way too small,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.420
cause I'm doubling the recipe.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.520
I'm actually double in the back

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.320
to making two lives.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.200
So I always make two lives at once.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.840
And I don't know why I grabbed this bowl for this.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.900
450 grams of flour from here,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.920
9:56. I put a little bit too much water,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.080
a little bit too much starter on it,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.480
so that should be working.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.540
The 20 grams of salt. Oh,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.040
the salt in. 20 grams,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.940
21 grams, 22 grams.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.340
But I never got it just perfect, so.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.060
And then we're gonna mix.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.160
Mix the salt in on top

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.960
right there.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.360
And this is the part where

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.720
a lot of people use their hands.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.680
I can absolutely

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.920
cannot stand having dough under my fingernails

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.120
and in my hands.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.760
It's just something I just

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.740
really don't enjoy. So, see, wow.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.080
This is the consistency you're gonna get

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.880
with just mixing it,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.300
like with the stick thing, spatula.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.520
And that's about the same as

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.400
you're gonna get with your hands.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.460
You do not need to put your fingers in here. This.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.040
If you leave this on the counter

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.760
or you leave this in the sink to wash later,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.000
this is gonna turn into concrete.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.720
The salad I mix,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.820
so I put on this,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.800
the dough is gonna Harden,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.080
and it's gonna be horrible to get it off.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.280
So I'm gonna rinse this off.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.400
I'm gonna cover this with an olive flour sack.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.240
Now Joanna gangsters pour out her Magnolia line.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.100
Hurry up. I bought this. That's all.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.660
Doesn't have to be airtight.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.080
It stops the dough.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.160
Anything from getting into the dough,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.560
and it stops the dough from

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.120
kind of getting a hard skin on the top.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.320
Now we're gonna do the stretch and fold.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.440
This part is super easy.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.800
Do not be intimidated.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.580
I'm gonna use wet hands

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.560
so the dough doesn't stick to my fingers.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.860
Scoop around the side,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.500
and I'm just gonna lift it up and pull it back down.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.280
Normally use two hands for this,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.320
but baby on my lap.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.020
Then we just gonna keep doing that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.180
every 30 minutes,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.560
three to four times.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.720
Never stretch and folded four times.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.700
I think the most I've ever done is three.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.660
I'm only do two,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.180
and it's normally at least

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.460
an hour between stretching and folding.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.720
The lazy way I like to do it is start making my dough

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.080
as after I cook dinner

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.560
and I'm about to start getting the kids ready for bed,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.620
I make my dough,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.720
let it sit, and as I'm putting the kids To bed,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.360
getting their bags,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.160
whatever I'm doing.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.160
I'm coming into the kitchen,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.240
stretching and folding.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.860
Then before I get ready for bed,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.360
I might remember to do one last stretch and fold.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.200
And then I will leave it covered like this overnight.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.480
Now, when I wake up in the morning,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.320
it will be ready.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.440
It will be arisen.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.920
It would have been.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.880
It's both ferment

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.960
and it will be ready to shape and put into baskets

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.680
or smaller bowls

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.940
or whatever you wanna use.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240
Shape it ready to bake.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.960
Thanks for that.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.140
You just. Thanks.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.480
At this point,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.260
the dough is starting to get really smooth,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.300
so I can get a really good stretch.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.600
Now we'll leave it to bulk for men,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.460
and we'll be back.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.960
Fast forward the next morning.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.000
And now I'm shaping

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.980
and getting the dough ready to put in the baskets.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.240
Here, I'm kinda tucking the dough underneath itself

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.240
and pulling it towards me.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.640
And this gives the top nice and tight,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.900
which helps with the ride.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.240
This is a basket I actually got from target, and, like,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.920
the dollar section,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.340
I got three of them for, like, $4, I think.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.060
And I really like this for shaping dough.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.960
Then I'm gonna just wrap this up in this

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.000
flour stack towel and put it in the fridge.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.880
I'm gonna leave this in there for at least a day,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.680
and it'll be risen

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.720
ready for me to bake. This one,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.420
I'm gonna put in this cute Basket I got from IKEA.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.120
I really like this basket,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.120
and I wanna let this one sit on the counter for, like,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.460
four hours until it's risen and ready to bake.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.080
Now, I'm gonna use a preheated Dutch oven.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.080
This one's a speciality one for bread,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.000
but you can use any regular Dutch oven.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.880
Just use Parchment paper

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.040
if you use a regular Dutch oven as this deep

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.460
and it's easy to get it out.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.340
There she is.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.740
Lazy sourdough bread.
