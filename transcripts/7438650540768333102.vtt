00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
so I like to make sure that I show the good

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:06.160
bad and ugly of state of motherhood and motherhood in general on my page

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:09.040
and today is a really hard fucking day

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.360
and I just wanna talk about a little bit

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:12.440
because I know I'm not the only person who feels this way

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:15.040
I feel like I'm failing at everything

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:18.960
that I'm stretched so thin that I'm not accomplishing anything super well

00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:23.600
I feel like I'm being dragged behind semi truck that's going 100 miles per hour

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:24.800
but there's no one at the wheel

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:28.040
and I'm just holding onto a rope at the back of it and just

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:29.240
it's not getting away from me

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.000
but I'm definitely not in the driver's seat

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:35.400
and I think I potentially stretched myself so thin trying to be good

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:39.100
and on top of everything that I'm on top of absolutely nothing

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.040
and I logically know the part of this is

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.920
because we just got done with my daughter's birthday

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:45.120
it was a lot of work it was a lot of effort

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:47.440
it was like two days of not good sleep

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:50.440
and I'm starting Monday kind of behind the aimball because of it

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:52.120
but I feel completely drained

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:53.660
I feel completely drained

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.720
and I've so much to do and I feel paralyzed that I can't do anything

00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:00.420
because I'm gonna choose the wrong thing to focus on

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.280
and then everything else won't get done

00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.740
that actually might be my add

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.860
I've also been out of my meds for days because they had supply issues

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.040
so instead of being on my adderall and like

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:11.160
being able to think clearly

00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:15.680
I've been raw dogging this entire fucking weekend with extra shit to do

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.200
and it is not going well my friends

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:22.220
and today it just seems all so fucking impossible

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.160
cooking and taking down Halloween

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:27.040
and cleaning and doing laundry and getting everybody ready for cold weather

00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:29.960
and homeschooling the kids and making sure that they're learning cursive

00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:32.280
because all their friends in school are learning cursive

00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:33.760
even though I think it's fucking stupid

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:35.280
and they're not gonna need cursive

00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:37.040
usually I talk to my husband about all this

00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.320
but he's losing his shit too

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:41.640
because we are just trying to figure out the next chapter of our life

00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:42.840
and he is working so hard

00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:45.680
and he is burned out so we can't be lifting each other up

00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:48.880
because we're both dragging ourselves behind the semi truck

00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:50.040
and on top of everything

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:54.000
I'm finally at a point where I think I just feel numb about the election

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.000
and my fears for what's going forward

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.960
I'm watching Donald Trump pick a cabinet that looks more like some sort of

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:05.540
like super villain Batcave of egotistical piece of shit men

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.960
um and I

00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:08.200
I just oh

00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:10.580
my god happy Thanksgiving

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.260
I need a vacation

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.960
and maybe a coma but like

00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:18.740
a small one just enough to feel really well rested
