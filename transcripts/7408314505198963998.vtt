00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
It does happen. Of course there's happy marriages.

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:05.121
Things work out. Sometimes it does work out.

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:07.641
I'm just saying that's not the norm.

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.641
That's not, you know,

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:09.961
that is

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:14.021
those one off success stories that everyone is trying to cling to,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.880
pretending like that could be their reality.

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:18.521
So for the people that it does work out for,

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:20.781
I'm super happy for you. Genuinely,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.680
genuinely, like,

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:23.081
that's beautiful. I love love.

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:24.201
I'm happy that love exists.

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:25.621
I'm happy that love is real.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.800
I know for me, sometimes it.

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:29.721
It doesn't matter that it's been 25 years.

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:30.881
I've met women. I was a bartender.

00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:32.921
I met women that were married for 28 years,

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:34.401
and it fell apart. 35 years,

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:36.921
and then it fell apart. So until these people, like,

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:39.261
truly take their last breath,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.560
and after they're gone,

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.801
there's no ugly stories of the second family that the dad had

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:47.421
or whatever the fuck, you know,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.400
I'm here for it. I love it.

00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:51.121
I encourage it. It's great.

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:53.321
That's not that usually how it turns out.

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:55.641
Most relationships end.

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:58.081
I've never had a relationship that lasted forever.

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.521
I've never, you know,

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:01.001
that's never been my reality.

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:02.781
I've never seen it in anybody.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240
The people that I know that have lasted their whole

00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:06.321
entire life and died together,

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:09.421
they weren't happy. So,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.980
um, you know, sometimes.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.600
Sometimes

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:16.681
when I hear women talking about their marriage and how happy they are,

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:18.521
I mean, they're describing the same kind of marriage.

00:01:18.522 --> 00:01:19.561
I meant, I Was in.

00:01:19.562 --> 00:01:23.141
They're just okay with it.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.520
Some of the women that I've talked to that have.

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:27.341
That have these long lasting relationships,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.560
they are still oblivious to the shitty parts of their own life.

00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:34.561
They're just okay with it.

00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:35.981
You know what I mean? Like,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.540
even a pig likes to swim in shit.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.240
So there are some people that like it,

00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:44.921
and they're therefore. And for whatever reason,

00:01:44.922 --> 00:01:46.721
if you're happy, you're happy,

00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:49.681
and I'm happy for you, I'll share in that happiness.

00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:51.781
I just, um,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.120
have a strong, burning feeling inside that more often than not,

00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:58.421
that's not the case.
