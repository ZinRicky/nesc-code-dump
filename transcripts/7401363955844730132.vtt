00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.320
as macabre as it may sound

00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:02.090
this night right here

00:00:02.091 --> 00:00:03.595
 is probably gonna be what I think about 

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:04.440
when I'm on my deathbed

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:05.440
but before I made it here

00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:07.287
the day started in winter fkn Wonderland 

00:00:07.288 --> 00:00:08.640
at the top of the Crown Ranges

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.760
At at 69 kilometres long and going up over 1,000 metres

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.640
this road is definitely aiming to please

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:15.440
and it doesn't just have impressive dimensions

00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:17.120
it's beautiful too but be warned

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.665
it does get icy and it’s slippery when wet 😏 

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.800
 made it over to Wanaka for Puzzling World

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:22.920
which boasts its been keeping it weird since ‘73

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.880
and I've been keeping it weird since the 1900s

00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:26.320
so I feel totally at home here

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:28.640
and if you ever wondered what the inside of my mind feels like

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:31.120
I feel like this room is a pretty accurate depiction

00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:32.800
I haven't been here since I was about 16

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:35.240
and there's heaps of new wacky shit to buzz out over

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:37.880
we made our way through the exhibitions before heading out to the maze

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:39.840
the kids keep running off in three different directions

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:43.120
so I had to dislocate my joints multiple times just to keep up

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:44.921
It’s a good thing my pain receptors were removed 

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:45.840
alongside my frontal lobe

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.480
made our way to the famous Wanaka tree

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.200
which was.. fkn underwhelming actually 

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:52.520
did still have an impressive congregation of worshippers at its base

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:53.440
so that's good at least

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:55.480
 then it was time to head back across the mountains

00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:57.040
cause we had a date with Coronet Peak

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:58.240
I've never night skied before

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:00.440
in fact I hadn’t even heard of it until we came to Queenstown 

00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:02.400
but apparently on Wednesday and Friday nights

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.818
you can come up here and ski this mountain in the evening 

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:05.360
truth be told

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:07.360
we weren't actually planning on skiing in the evening

00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:09.145
we were trying to make it here during the day 

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:10.000
I don't know about you

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.080
but I find with three kids it's hard to be on time for anything anyway

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.960
my day plans going out the window was actually a blessing in disguise

00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:17.720
because this was such a fkn vibe

00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:19.680
Mark and I took turns tagging in and out on the kids

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:21.800
so that we could have some time skiing by ourselves

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.040
and that was actually really nice

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.160
when it was time to take a break

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:27.240
we found that they'd set up a DJ station, they’d lit a bunch of fires

00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:29.960
there was a dance floor and we of course has some mulled wine

00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:32.480
we got the kids a snack for the price of a full meal

00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:34.200
and everyone was just having such a good time

00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:36.200
we saw the most picturesque sunset and honestly

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:36.960
its days like this

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:39.335
where I just feel so grateful to be able to call 

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:40.160
Aotearoa my home

00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:41.840
by the way I know I still sound a bit snuffly

00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:43.040
so I apologise for that

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.360
but I learnt a fact this week and I just have to share it with you

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:46.040
but did you know that

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:50.000
some of the oldest archaeological evidence of skiing is over 8,000 years old

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:50.920
kind of wild to think

00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:52.489
such an overpriced sport has such 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.920
practical and humble beginnings

00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:55.360
anyway this was a day for the books

00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:56.980
but tomorrow we're going home
