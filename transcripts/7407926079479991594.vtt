00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.640
With all the chickens coming in from outside,

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:04.121
I've been continuously making some sort of stock,

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:06.041
and I haven't been able to use that stock straight away.

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:09.761
So I need to can it. And I'm gonna use these wet jars to can now.

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:11.241
I've been canning for years.

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:13.921
Um, a few upgrades I've been having lately

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:16.521
is this amazing digital pressure can

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:17.901
I bug it? Back to that in a minute.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.040
But I recently started using wax jars

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:21.721
and they're pretty popular right now.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.001
I feel like I see them all over

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.761
of people using them for sourdough and storage and stuff

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:28.101
for leftovers or doing overnight oats.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.000
But the best thing about these jars is that you can just cam with them.

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.781
You can reuse the seals. Are like normal pens

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.200
cutting jars, you have to.

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:41.061
Or any other brand of like that kind of style cutting jar.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.080
You need to keep continuously buying new lids every time.

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:46.221
You can save the rings, but you need to buy new lids.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.620
With these jars,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.760
you can keep using the lids, um,

00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:54.041
and then you just keep reusing that rubber seal, um,

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:55.401
to reseal the jars.

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:59.241
You can continuously reuse these until the seal starts to deteriorate,

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:00.901
then you could just replace that seal.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.000
These jars are really nice and thick glass.

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:05.521
The lids are nice and thick.

00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:07.081
I feel like it's very sturdy.

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:09.721
There's also a decent selection of different types of lids

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:11.561
you can get for them. You can Get push on lids.

00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:14.041
Wooden lids. I've seen quite a few different ones

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:15.201
that I'm gonna try and get some for,

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:16.201
like, leftovers,

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:20.681
but right now all my wet jars have stock in them in the pantry.

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:22.521
So am I gonna have to get some more jars

00:01:22.522 --> 00:01:24.261
or I'm gonna have to start using some more stock?

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.880
So to remove the lid,

00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:29.401
you just pull this tab and then it just releases that seal

00:01:29.402 --> 00:01:32.961
and then it's good to go. I would also recommend this digital canner.

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:35.361
It's definitely a nice upgrade from a regular one,

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:36.160
but definitely not necessary.
