00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.109
taking my front step from dero to hero 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.200
wasn't exactly on my bingo card this week

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.114
But once I start something I struggle to stop 

00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:07.280
and at this point of my life

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:09.260
I've given up trying to fight the impulses 

00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:10.320
and I just let them win

00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:11.960
it certainly keeps life interesting

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:13.760
so I water blasted everything I could see

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:15.380
Potted a new plant for the front step 

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:17.000
and things were starting to take shape

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.560
but I knew we were far from done

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:19.640
cause for some reason

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:21.189
I thought it would be a good idea to 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.320
paint my own front door mat

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.600
and it was significantly harder than I anticipated

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:25.583
but still heaps of fun 

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:27.720
It would have been a lot easier if I'd made a stencil

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.720
but my printer decided it didn't wanna print

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.372
and it didn't wanna print because I didn't 

00:00:31.373 --> 00:00:32.680
wanna pay the subscription anymore

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:34.615
so despite the fact that I own the printer 

00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:35.200
and I own the ink

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.066
apparently I have to pay a subscription 

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:38.280
every month just to use it

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.680
and that type of capitalism really fks me off to be honest

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:42.320
but that's the story for another day anyway

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:44.299
you've really got a layer the paint onto this 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.720
and I'm talking layers and layers

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.000
I tried to free hand a font and then I did a border

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.640
and I've added some flowers for a little bit of decoration

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:52.240
when it dries I'll spray it with a sealer

00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:55.040
but while I was waiting I got distracted by shiny things

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.680
or rather the lack thereof

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:57.920
and I'm sure there are other people

00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:59.617
out there that suddenly find themselves in 

00:00:59.618 --> 00:01:00.960
the middle of the most random task

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.928
but I noticed that all of the door hardware 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.360
was super dirty and aged looking

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:07.040
so I took to it with some barkeepers friend and a scrub daddy

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:09.000
and this combo always works wonders for me 

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.960
it was taking years of her life like honestly

00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:13.080
she was ageing backwards and by the time I was done

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.127
they were quite shiny and I was feeling quite 

00:01:15.128 --> 00:01:16.240
accomplished to be honest

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:16.840
and like yes

00:01:16.841 --> 00:01:19.160
I probably could have gone out and just bought new hardware

00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:20.280
and maybe one day I will

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:23.040
But I always say I don't mind if it's old so long as it's clean

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.000
and I personally get immense satisfaction

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.740
out of restoring something that's been in my 

00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:27.915
home for a long long time 

00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:30.720
hanging out with the door for so long was probably my downfall

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.760
because it was really hard not to notice all of the chips in the paint

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:37.160
and my toxic trait is that I gaslight myself into believing that a project

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.120
is gonna be a lot quicker and easier than it normally turns out to be

00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:42.040
but it's that kinda delusion that gets shit done

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:43.300
so I'm not mad at it 

00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:45.760
side note but have you ever seen a woman sanding in her slippers

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:47.233
cause it was the first for me 

00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:48.560
and hopefully a last anyway

00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:50.880
I sanded through the grades on the door and the door frame

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:53.040
and then I decided to paint cause why not

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:56.300
I was actually amazed to see how yellow the original paint was

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.560
compared to the new stark white that I was laying over

00:01:58.561 --> 00:01:59.800
and with any project like this

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.600
it's really hard to know where to start and stop

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:03.520
so I did the entire frame inside and out

00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:05.240
then it was time to turn my attention to the door

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:06.680
and I actually really like the blue

00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:07.616
it just needs refreshing 

00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:08.440
Thereâ€™s it's still a bit to do

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:09.703
so come back for the reveal
