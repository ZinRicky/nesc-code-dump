00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
while we're all waiting for the pool to fill up

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:03.201
I thought I would just quickly 

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.080
renovate the kitchen

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:05.240
and one of my specialties is

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:07.051
gaslighting myself into believing that a 

00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:08.200
project's gonna be quicker

00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:09.880
and easier than it turns out to be

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:11.605
and honestly if I didn't have that blind 

00:00:11.606 --> 00:00:13.120
delusional faith driving me each day

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:14.880
I probably wouldn't attempt anything

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.880
and the plan here is just to give her a wee facelift

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:18.680
because functionally there's nothing wrong with her

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:20.640
but aesthetically it's not for me

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:22.680
we started the same way we did the pool really

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.560
by removing all of the old tiles

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:26.548
and then the boys from architectural stone 

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:28.120
came and removed the old benchtops

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:29.240
and installed the new ones

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.680
I chose a beautiful piece of Dekton from Cosentino

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:32.781
which I'll show you soon 

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.280
before the sink and the tap went in

00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:35.680
and now the hard work really begins

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.200
because I basically wanna tile as much of the kitchen as

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:39.189
as humanly possible 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.080
if you're new here

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.880
we've spent the last year and a half restoring our beautiful

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:44.640
but kind of beat up mid century home

00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:47.000
and we've tackled a few projects that involve tiling

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.880
and I have surprised myself with how much I enjoy doing it

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:51.240
I mixed up some tile adhesive

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.160
which is much like baking a cake except

00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:53.742
you know 

00:00:53.743 --> 00:00:54.520
a lot easier

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.800
popped up the tile trim and then notched the adhesive

00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:58.360
as if I actually know what I'm doing

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:00.560
and then I got to work positioning the tiles

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:02.520
and these are the Kreuz tiles in Matte White

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.010
which is a porcelain Japanese Kitkat tile 

00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:05.840
from TileSpace

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:07.200
one thing I love about these tiles

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:08.640
aside from how cute they are

00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:11.560
is that they come with a mesh backing so they're so easy to apply

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:13.470
so much easier than the pool tiles that had 

00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:14.600
that adhesive on the front

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:16.808
I have a bit of a crazy vision with where and 

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:18.200
how I want these tiles placed

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:20.280
and at this point I'm feeling kinda nervous

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.360
only because I want them kind of everywhere

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:24.120
and I hope it's not gonna be too much

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:26.800
but the vision for this project is just to lighten and brighten

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:28.720
The natural light in here already isn't great

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.320
but having all of those dark finishes

00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:32.700
just made it feel a lot dingier than it needed to be 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.880
if you've seen any of my other room renovations

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:36.378
you will know I love using colour

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:38.012
 but for the kitchen I wanna go for 

00:01:38.013 --> 00:01:39.203
clean natural and textured 

00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:40.880
we took the tiles right to the ceiling

00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:43.880
but then this extractor fan was really getting to me to be honest

00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:45.200
and some people might like this look

00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:46.520
it's not terrible I suppose

00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:48.600
but for me I just fkn hate looking at it

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:50.945
and I am very fortunate to be married to a 

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:52.200
man who's easily bribed

00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:54.200
once I corrupted him he built me a box

00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:55.920
added some moulding so it seamlessly 

00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:57.640
blended with the ceiling and tiled it

00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:58.640
I would have done it myself

00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:00.419
but the ceilings are actually really high 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.860
and I said I couldn't reach, so.. 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.640
he cut some slits into each side for ventilation

00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:05.720
and then it was time to grout

00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:06.773
which was terrifying 

00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:08.680
I started with a sample of light grout

00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:11.200
but we kinda lost the shape and the impact of the tile

00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:12.360
and it made them throw yellow

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:14.120
which just looked like stained teeth

00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:14.697
if I'm honest 

00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:16.760
I never actually thought I'd be a dark grout girly

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.560
but here we are and I think it was the move 

00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:20.606
and I'm so sorry but full reveal in the next part
