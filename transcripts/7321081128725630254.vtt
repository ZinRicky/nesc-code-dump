00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
If you've been wondering how to help the people of Gaza

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.840
without your money or resources falling into

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.080
the hands of people who use it to promote violence,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.160
I would like to suggest doctors without borders.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.920
It's an international organization that is focused on

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.620
helping citizens caught in crisis and in violence.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.200
I think, especially if you're a Jewish American

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.000
like I am, it's really important to remember that

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.240
the dozens did not ask for this,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.560
and they're having entire communities be wiped out.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.440
That their citizens are just as worth protecting

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.540
as those in Israel.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.560
Without a prolonged ceasefire and aid,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.960
these people are being sentenced to death

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.640
for a crime that was committed by a select few.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.640
A select few, mind you,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.200
that will probably weather this

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.820
a lot better than the average family.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.800
Hamas has the resources and the organization

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.000
to get out of dodge

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.740
in a way that the average family can't.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.280
Don't believe

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.400
will destroy Hamas

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.540
by murdering a bunch of innocent people.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.560
If you believe, like I do,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.800
that Hamas wants the destruction of the Jewish people,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.480
then we have to be so careful.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.760
We have to hold on to our belief

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.160
in the sanctity of human life

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.780
and not let their hate infect us in turn.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.760
Haven't always been able to articulate this well.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.480
Don't believe civilians are collateral damage.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.320
I can dismiss

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.400
stand with the Jewish community,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.420
but I also stand with
