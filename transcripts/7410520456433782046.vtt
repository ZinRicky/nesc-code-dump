00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.520
every family is different

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:03.720
and that means every homeschool is gonna be different too

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:06.800
the beauty of homeschooling is that you get to do whatever works for your family

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.040
and of all the homeschool families you see online

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.800
no two are gonna be exactly the same

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.680
sure you might have the same resources or curriculum as someone else

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:15.840
but how you use them is totally unique to you

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.120
our child it's why I started sharing our homeschooling journey

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.340
but also why I started following other homeschool

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.760
I truly love seeing and learning what other people are using in their homeschool

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:26.200
my areas of weakness are someone else's strength

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:28.720
and there's so much value in watching and learning what they're doing

00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:30.880
I am really good at creating hands on lessons

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:32.040
especially for math and reading

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.480
but I am terrible at history

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:35.240
art and music

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:38.080
so I tend to follow people who are posting that kind of content

00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:39.040
because when I follow them

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:41.662
I'm learning from them and I'm strengthening my weaknesses
