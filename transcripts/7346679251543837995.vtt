I've been craving Nando's all throughout my pregnancy.

00:02.760 --> 00:05.080
When I found out they had a location close to us,

00:05.080 --> 00:07.800
I made lucky get in the car and drive us there.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.760
I've been to a lot of Nando's locations all over the world,

00:10.760 --> 00:13.140
so I'm really excited to try out this one.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.960
Favourite one was in South Africa, so see how this one compares.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.240
We looked at the menu, then lucky placed our order and paid.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.520
You got two different lemonades?

00:21.520 --> 00:23.880
Mine was a mango orange one which was so good.

00:23.880 --> 00:27.420
And then he got a lavender one which was very strong but very good.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.520
Shortly after our food came out,

00:29.520 --> 00:32.080
lucky immediately knew that we had to order some more

00:32.080 --> 00:33.840
cause it was not enough food for him.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.680
We got the chicken thighs,

00:35.680 --> 00:40.220
halloumi, peri peri fries, and chicken legs to share a salad,

00:40.240 --> 00:42.300
and got the kids some Mac and cheese.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.240
I took a few bites,

00:43.240 --> 00:45.720
I looked over and lucky was already done with his plate.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.640
Oh, he was thinking of what he wants to order.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.760
I tried the salad.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.360
The salad was very mediocre.

00:50.360 --> 00:51.400
I didn't really like it.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.600
But the Brussels sprouts were so good.

00:53.600 --> 00:57.240
Peri peri fries could have been a little crispier, but we ate it all,

00:57.240 --> 00:59.520
stacked the plates, and then ordered round two.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.480
We just got our favorite things again.

01:01.480 --> 01:05.440
Honestly, the peri peri sauce isn't as spicy as I thought it would be.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.000
Even the hot was kind of mild.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.480
Picked out All the Brussels sprouts without the ranch on top,

01:09.480 --> 01:11.600
because lucky doesn't like creamy sauces.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.960
And we wrapped it up.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.440
Needed something sweet after,

01:14.440 --> 01:15.880
so we got some ice cream.

01:15.880 --> 01:18.320
They had the most interesting flavors.

01:18.320 --> 01:22.120
We taste tested a bunch and then decided on what we were gonna get.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.960
Lucky got guava and olive oil,

01:23.960 --> 01:25.680
while I got vanilla and.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.040
And raspberry lychee.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.420
I love the combination of getting a sorbet and something creamy.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.120
Always do it. It's so good.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.500
This was perfect.
