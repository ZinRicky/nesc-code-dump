00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
I'm very pleased to rise today for the third reading of Bill 38

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.061
and act respecting child and Family Services,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.940
Indigenous Jurisdiction and other amendments.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.620
This is a historic piece of legislation.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:22.160
This paves away legislatively in Manitoba for once and for all

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:24.461
decolonizing child welfare

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.100
and ensuring that children are in there with their families,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.480
in their communities, in their nations,

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.581
being raised by their families,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.800
being raised in their culture and their traditions,

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.941
being raised in their language,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.300
being raised on their lands.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.440
I don't know if many people can truly

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:49.161
appreciate how important this legislation is today

00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:52.701
when we look at the colonial history of Canada

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.960
that has more often than not

00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:58.721
been waged on the bodies of children,

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:03.061
of indigenous children, first by way of residential schools,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.400
then by the 60 scoop, and then,

00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:11.581
as most would suggest, the continuation in child welfare.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.900
I'm so proud to be a part of a government that is actively pursuing

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.840
this path, that's actively pursuing decolonizing child welfare

00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:26.261
and reinstating

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.420
where the welfare of our children should have always been.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.160
That had always been for thousands of years and many,

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:37.701
many, many generations.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.980
It always rested with our people,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.500
in our territories, in our lands,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.840
with our grandmothers, with our mothers,

00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:49.061
with our aunties, with our fathers.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.680
We have always known how to care for our children.

00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.261
And today writes that wrong

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.200
or is at least the beginning steps of writing that wrong.

00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:02.541
I want to say a profound Meguitch

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.860
to all of the folks that have contributed

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.180
to these legislative changes.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.940
Of course, my team in families,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.360
I say it all the time,

00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:17.881
I have some of the most extraordinary team members

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:21.001
and I'm so honored to be the minister responsible

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:24.741
to work alongside such a dedicated,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.040
smart and committed individuals

00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:33.161
and advancing jurisdiction and decolonizing child welfare.

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:35.341
I want to acknowledge the leadership,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.420
all of our indigenous leadership.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.320
I want to acknowledge and say

00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:42.361
Miguel to all of the mothers

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.721
and grandmothers

00:02:43.722 --> 00:02:48.581
and aunties who have fought to decolonize child welfare.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.040
For as long as I've been doing this work,

00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:54.081
not necessarily as the minister of families,

00:02:54.082 --> 00:02:57.961
but as an indigenous woman in the community fighting for our rights,

00:02:57.962 --> 00:03:00.341
including changes to child welfare,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.700
it has always been LED by women.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.080
It's always been LED by our matriarchs and our grandmothers

00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:10.441
and our elders that have sought to decolonize child welfare

00:03:10.442 --> 00:03:13.821
and bring our children home where they rightfully belong.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.680
And so today, I say a profound migwhich

00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:20.461
to each and every one of those phenomenal women,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.680
including our own special advisor on indigenous women's issues, uh,

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:28.641
Cora Morgan. Cora Morgan was the, uh,

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:31.001
Family Advocate at AMC's, uh,

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:34.421
First Nations Family Advocate Office for seven years.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.720
And her

00:03:35.721 --> 00:03:40.521
and her amazing team did phenomenal work at reunifying families

00:03:40.522 --> 00:03:42.521
and bringing families together

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:46.441
and also did work, spiritual and cultural work

00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:49.841
here on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly

00:03:49.842 --> 00:03:52.361
back in October of 2020. Uh,

00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:53.881
when The former government

00:03:53.882 --> 00:03:57.141
sought to legislate the rights of indigenous children away.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.020
They set up camp and for weeks on end had individuals that fasted.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.200
In fact, I was one of the individuals that fasted

00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:10.561
alongside one of our colleagues as well.

00:04:10.562 --> 00:04:16.741
And they provided that cultural and that spiritual foundation

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.000
to be able to do this work in a good way.

00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:25.721
And I wanna dedicate Bill 38 to indigenous children.

00:04:25.722 --> 00:04:29.401
This legislative framework is in honor of you.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:32.141
It's in honor of your journey.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.380
It's an honor of everything that you've been through.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.920
But it's also an honor of a path forward.

00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:43.121
Our government has a sacred commitment to you

00:04:43.122 --> 00:04:48.681
to do all that we can to ensure that these systems aren't needed,

00:04:48.682 --> 00:04:51.101
that our families are healthy,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.420
that our families are thriving,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.940
that our families are together,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.580
that our families know and see how beautiful

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.020
and strong and loving that they are,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.140
and that the next generation of children,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.040
indigenous children, grow up in our strength.

00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:16.561
As indigenous peoples, I always talk about that our people,

00:05:16.562 --> 00:05:20.941
our children, our women deserve everything good,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.500
everything good that these lands have to offer everybody else.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.080
Our people deserve nothing but the best.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:34.161
Our children deserve nothing but the best.

00:05:34.162 --> 00:05:38.981
They deserve to be loved and to be safe and to be seen.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.640
And they deserve to be with their families

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.781
in their communities and in their nations.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.480
And my solemn commitment and my sacred responsibility is to ensure,

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.981
as minister Responsible is to ensure,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.200
but I'm doing everything that I possibly can to ensure that

00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:58.941
that is the path forward here for Manitoba.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.178
Make watch.
