My sister has been staying at her house for a few weeks now

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:06.201
and she usually does not have a preference on what we eat

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:07.981
as long as it's vegetarian,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.400
but today she told me she was craving potato gnocchi,

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.381
so I obviously had to make her some right away.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.400
I baked my potato until soft,

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:19.081
grated my tomatoes, chopped up some onions,

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:20.521
sliced up some garlic.

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:24.201
I sauteed my onion with some basil until it was soft,

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:27.321
added in my garlic, and let that go for a couple more minutes

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:29.621
before adding in my grated tomato.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.480
I seasoned with some salt, pepper,

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:35.561
Italian seasoning, let that simmer while I mashed up my potato.

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:37.601
I made sure there were no clumps,

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:39.761
and then it was time to get my gnocchi going.

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:42.201
I combined some flour with the potatoes,

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:43.481
some eggs, salt,

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:45.121
and as soon as it came together,

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.441
lucky needed it until it was smooth.

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:51.601
Once it came together, I cut it into smaller pieces to roll out.

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:53.641
I rolled out my dough into little ropes

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:56.001
before cutting it into bite size pieces

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:59.161
and transferring it over to a flowered baking tray.

00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:01.321
I let them boil for about a minute or two

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:02.921
until they floated to the top,

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:05.261
toss them in my sauce, and they were done.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.880
This dish is so simple but so good.

00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:12.061
I top it with a bunch of Parmesan cheese and it's absolutely divine.
