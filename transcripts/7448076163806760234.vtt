00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
My husband's favorite cookies are Milano,

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:03.561
so I asked our Bella if she would make him some

00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:04.881
while I did my red light therapy.

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:06.241
So I got started right away.

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:09.841
I started by making my cookie dough consisting of all purpose

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.721
regeneratively grown flour,

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:12.441
unrefined salt,

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:15.321
and got my Kitchen Aid stand mixer set up with a paddle attachment.

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:18.521
I then sifted maple sugar using a fine mesh sieve

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:19.861
for a soft consistency.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.840
I press the sugar through while sifting constant to my mixer.

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:25.921
I added in the sifted maple sugar room temperature butter,

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.161
one egg, two whites,

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:30.021
and vanilla. Lastly the flour and salts.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.880
Great! Next

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:34.081
I added my cookie dough into a piping bag

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:36.241
to create the oval Milano cookies.

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:38.921
I fill a baking sheet by piping 2 inch cookies

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:39.761
and let those bake

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:42.001
while I get started on my chocolate ganache filling.

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:43.081
Using a double boiler,

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:45.841
I first melt the good ingredient dark chocolate chips,

00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:47.561
then stir in some raw cream.

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:50.401
Consistency is smooth and silky and perfect.

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:52.281
Cookies come together effortlessly

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:55.001
by spreading ganache on the bottom cookie first,

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.641
then pushing the top cookie down.

00:00:56.642 --> 00:00:58.121
I've never had a Milano before,

00:00:58.122 --> 00:01:01.081
but this looks just like the cookie my father described to me

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:02.361
from his childhood dreams.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.001
As a kid, he would dunk them in milk

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.921
and let them soften before consuming the entire packet.

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:08.241
Which doesn't surprise me

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:11.221
because they're also processed and highly addictive.
