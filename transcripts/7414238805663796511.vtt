00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.080
Stories like this are the reason why I think

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:06.561
women should think twice about having children,

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:10.321
because children are not, are not given, like,

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:13.241
the respect that they deserve in the world.

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:14.201
People don't. Look,

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:16.401
the society in general is, like,

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:17.721
really annoyed at kids, like,

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:20.141
but he thinks it's really funny to just, like,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.120
not accept kids and laugh at how stupid kids are,

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:26.801
how annoying kids are. And it's kind of like the sentiment,

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:29.841
like, when you go out in public with children,

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:32.161
they are looked at like, so annoying.

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:35.121
You are looked at like, oh,

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:37.321
my god, somebody brought kids.

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:40.941
Fucking gray. And it's like,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.120
just really, like.

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.121
I mean, even the grocery store you get looks like,

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:46.761
why are there fucking kids here?

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:49.001
Like, you're supposed to have children.

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:52.521
But then children aren't really allowed to exist anywhere or be kids.

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:53.601
And, like, they.

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:58.521
It's a learning process. They have to learn how to behave in public by

00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:00.361
kind of being shitty in public sometimes.

00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:03.281
And it's our job as a community,

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:05.241
as a society, and as their moms to, like,

00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:08.441
do that, but it's not really welcome.

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:13.241
People are going way too far with the hate they have for kids,

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:15.761
which makes it really fucking hard to be a mom,

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:18.881
and it makes you feel really unsafe for your children.

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:20.721
I just think being a kid is hard,

00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:23.908
and being a mom of those kids is also really hard.
