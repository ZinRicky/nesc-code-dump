00:00.200 --> 00:00.800
Okay, ladies,

00:00.800 --> 00:01.720
I'm gonna tell you something

00:01.720 --> 00:03.040
that the rest of the world won't.

00:03.040 --> 00:05.680
You don't need to have a hoe phase.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.600
I got a DM from a girl that's kind of like my age,

00:08.600 --> 00:11.280
and she asked me if I thought that that was, like,

00:11.280 --> 00:12.520
a necessary part of life.

00:12.520 --> 00:13.960
All her friends are telling her, like,

00:13.960 --> 00:15.400
this is the time of your life to, like,

00:15.400 --> 00:16.200
sleep around,

00:16.200 --> 00:17.460
be promiscuous,

00:17.680 --> 00:19.200
not get emotionally attached to guys,

00:19.200 --> 00:21.200
just, like, hop around from one guy to the next.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.140
And she's like,

00:22.400 --> 00:23.800
am I. Do I need to do this?

00:23.800 --> 00:26.380
Um, my opinion is no,

00:26.480 --> 00:27.720
nobody needs to do that.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.480
In fact, I think there are a lot of downsides

00:30.480 --> 00:32.520
to the whole hookup culture in general,

00:32.520 --> 00:34.880
and this idea that before you can settle down,

00:34.880 --> 00:35.280
you need to,

00:35.280 --> 00:36.780
like, go crazy.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.440
And I think it's really ironic that the, like,

00:39.440 --> 00:41.200
postmodern feminist movement right now

00:41.200 --> 00:42.800
kind of seems to be pushing this idea of

00:42.800 --> 00:43.920
like, you know,

00:43.920 --> 00:45.840
women should be promiscuous and like,

00:45.840 --> 00:46.640
cause it, you know,

00:46.640 --> 00:47.840
makes them feel more, like,

00:47.840 --> 00:48.720
equal to men.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.660
I don't think that that's true.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.720
I think that hookup culture,

00:52.720 --> 00:54.320
according to the studies that I've looked up,

00:54.320 --> 00:55.760
um, harms women,

00:55.760 --> 00:59.520
and it doesn't fulfill what women really want.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.920
It fulfills what toxic,

01:00.920 --> 01:03.100
like, non committing men want,

01:03.480 --> 01:04.000
but for women,

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
it usually, um,

01:05.000 --> 01:05.960
doesn't do much.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.040
Regarding hookups,

01:07.040 --> 01:07.520
men and women

01:07.520 --> 01:09.480
were both asked the same kind of questions,

01:09.480 --> 01:11.960
and the reason for hookup

01:11.960 --> 01:16.520
Regret for women was that they felt used a lot of times,

01:16.520 --> 01:17.280
and they, um,

01:17.280 --> 01:18.560
kind of regretted that.

01:18.560 --> 01:19.240
And for men,

01:19.240 --> 01:21.560
their biggest regret was that the woman they were with

01:21.560 --> 01:23.100
wasn't attractive enough.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.600
How is this empowering for women

01:25.600 --> 01:27.280
to tell them to just go, like,

01:27.280 --> 01:28.440
sleep with these kind of guys?

01:28.440 --> 01:29.320
Like, that's not.

01:29.320 --> 01:30.760
That's not empowerment, honey,

01:30.760 --> 01:31.446
you don't need to do that.
