00:00.000 --> 00:01.480
For the ladies present today,

00:01.481 --> 00:03.661
congratulations on an amazing accomplishment.

00:03.680 --> 00:04.920
You should be proud of all that you have achieved

00:04.921 --> 00:06.561
to this point in your young lives.

00:06.562 --> 00:09.041
I want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you,

00:09.042 --> 00:11.761
the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you.

00:11.762 --> 00:12.921
How many of you are sitting here now,

00:12.922 --> 00:14.201
about to cross the stage

00:14.202 --> 00:15.921
and are thinking about all the promotions and titles

00:15.922 --> 00:17.221
you are going to get in your career?

00:17.240 --> 00:19.440
Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world,

00:19.441 --> 00:22.081
but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited

00:22.082 --> 00:22.841
about your marriage

00:22.842 --> 00:24.621
and the children you will bring into this world.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.480
I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel,

00:26.481 --> 00:28.721
would be the first to say that her life truly started

00:28.722 --> 00:31.581
when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.520
I got my bachelor's degree when I was 21,

00:33.521 --> 00:35.081
and I was about eight months pregnant.

00:35.082 --> 00:37.741
And I would have loved to hear this kind of speech on my graduation.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.320
I loved my college experience.

00:39.321 --> 00:40.161
It was incredible.

00:40.162 --> 00:41.201
It was so much fun.

00:41.202 --> 00:42.321
I worked really, really,

00:42.322 --> 00:44.241
really hard those few years,

00:44.242 --> 00:46.641
and I love that I was supported in doing that

00:46.642 --> 00:49.761
and also being coming a mom and being able to say,

00:49.762 --> 00:50.121
you know what?

00:50.122 --> 00:50.801
I have a degree,

00:50.802 --> 00:51.721
I have an education.

00:51.722 --> 00:54.281
It was great, but there's nothing compared to motherhood

00:54.282 --> 00:55.921
and this Is really why I'm here.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.341
Doesn't mean I can't do both.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.280
But it was nice at my graduation

00:59.281 --> 01:01.721
to be supported by my friends and my family

01:01.722 --> 01:05.681
and knowing that my main priority was not going to be

01:05.682 --> 01:06.881
going to a nine to five,

01:06.882 --> 01:07.761
you know, office job.

01:07.762 --> 01:09.401
It was going to be being a mother.

01:09.402 --> 01:13.321
We hear so much praise for women who have careers,

01:13.322 --> 01:15.401
and we're constantly told how important it is

01:15.402 --> 01:17.681
and how wonderful it is for women to get,

01:17.682 --> 01:18.121
you know,

01:18.122 --> 01:21.801
really good degrees and to be CEOs and to be heads of companies,

01:21.802 --> 01:22.641
and that's, like,

01:22.642 --> 01:23.801
the most important thing you can do.

01:23.802 --> 01:27.161
But if somebody dare suggest that something else is more important.

01:27.162 --> 01:28.161
Ever canceled?

01:28.162 --> 01:29.281
You cannot say that.

01:29.282 --> 01:29.921
But to be honest,

01:29.922 --> 01:31.001
some of us really,

01:31.002 --> 01:33.401
really appreciate that kind of encouragement.

01:33.402 --> 01:35.381
And I know all the news organizations,

01:35.440 --> 01:36.960
everybody's freaking out right now. Like,

01:36.961 --> 01:39.201
this is just so horrible.

01:39.202 --> 01:42.841
This man preaching biblical things at a Catholic school.

01:42.842 --> 01:44.161
Like, how dare he?

01:44.162 --> 01:46.561
Doesn't he know that he needs to fall in line

01:46.562 --> 01:48.621
with what society has deemed

01:48.720 --> 01:50.560
appropriate for women to celebrate?

01:50.561 --> 01:52.800
Actually thought it was really sweet, and I liked it.
