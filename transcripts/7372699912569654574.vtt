00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.000
Meet Kalpanotavla, the first Indian born woman to go up to outer space.

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.401
Kalpano was an engineer,

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:07.561
pilot and astronaut

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:11.041
who immigrated from India to the United States to study aerospace

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:12.921
engineering. After graduating,

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:15.001
Kalpano became a researcher at NASA

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:16.641
and joined the NASA astronaut core

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:19.881
after officially becoming a US citizen in 1995.

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:22.881
Two years later, she was ready to go on her first space mission,

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:26.061
making her the first Indian born woman to go up to space.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.480
Kapana embarked on her second space mission in 2003,

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:33.501
helping to conduct nearly 80 experiments studying earth and space.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.460
Tragically, when her space shuttle re entered Earth's atmosphere,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.600
damage to the shuttle caused the spacecraft to fall apart,

00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:43.001
unaliving Kalpena and her fellow astronauts.

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.441
Today, Kalpena's legacy lives on

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:48.141
through her contributions to aerospace research.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.440
She posthumously received the Congressional Space Medal of honor

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:53.001
and has had various streets,

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:56.581
buildings, and even asteroids and satellites named after her.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.143
