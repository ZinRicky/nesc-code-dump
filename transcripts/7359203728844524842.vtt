00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.920
I wanna talk about the dangers of being a stay at home mom

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:04.841
as a stay at home mom in a Bravo fan

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:08.381
and we're gonna relate this to Bravo Summerhouse and Kyle and Amanda

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.000
I have always said that being a stay at home mom

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:11.841
is a very dangerous position to put yourself in

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:15.041
and it really really really does relies on your partner

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:17.881
their ego and their sense of power dynamics

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:19.961
catch you up to speed about Kyle and Amanda

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:21.321
Kyle started his own company

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:24.281
Lover Boy and as that company started game momentum

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:26.041
he asked his then fiance

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:30.321
now wife to quit her job to come help him full time at Loverboy

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:30.681
she now

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:34.201
I believe is the director or creative director or the director of marketing

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:35.601
maybe both however

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.081
fast forward to present time

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:39.161
they've been married now for a year or two

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.241
and they're starting to be cracks in the marriage

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:45.381
and one of the things I'm starting to notice is that Kyle resents Amanda

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.240
for depending on him for an income

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:53.801
he also resents her and belittles her because he thinks he has full ownership

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:57.061
full money making capabilities and this company is his own

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.840
even though he asked his wife to leave her other paying job

00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:05.241
to come join his business that they would build together

00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:08.061
he clearly doesn't see it as both of their businesses

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.400
my husband is a business owner

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:13.321
I have never like gone to work with him in a full time capacity

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:16.401
but I have dabbled here and there and he watches the show with me

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:18.561
and we were deconstructing this and he was like

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:22.801
there is such a reality that money comes with entitlement

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:24.521
even if you don't want it to

00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:26.121
you almost have to check yourself

00:01:26.122 --> 00:01:29.441
because my husband has gotten in really busy times of his business

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:32.721
where he feels that he is working so hard or making so much money

00:01:32.722 --> 00:01:35.421
that he feels entitled to an easier time at home

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.560
we've talked through that and he's a very emotionally mature human being

00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.081
so like we're fine

00:01:40.082 --> 00:01:41.601
but Kyle and Amanda are not fine

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.521
because you're watching this power dynamic

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:46.661
dissolve the relationship into disgust

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.200
into resentment

00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:50.121
and it is eating away at the affection

00:01:50.122 --> 00:01:52.161
that both of these people have for each other

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:54.781
if they want this to continue in a healthy way

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.800
Kyle needs to admit that he couldn't do this at all without Amanda

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:01.061
and give her her fair due and respect necessary

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.200
and realize that just because you're bringing home the bacon

00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:06.401
doesn't mean you get to drop all of your responsibilities as a husband

00:02:06.402 --> 00:02:07.741
and a potential father

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.040
and Amanda needs to make sure that she is willing to deal with this man's ego

00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:15.041
and doesn't wanna have her own little pot of gold on the side

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:18.521
where she can get the respect and monetary compensation

00:02:18.522 --> 00:02:20.161
that she may need one day

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:21.581
when Mister Kyle

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.600
she's sick of dealing with him

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.881
is a classic cautionary tale for stay at home moms

00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:29.721
for people who could end up in a financial abusive situation

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:31.561
with money comes entitlement

00:02:31.562 --> 00:02:32.621
comes power

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.080
and if there's too much of an unequal power dynamic within a relationship

00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:38.941
that is a right possibility for abuse
