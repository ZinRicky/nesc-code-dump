00:00.080 --> 00:02.560
Here are some things I prepped to make my week just a little bit

00:02.560 --> 00:04.320
easier. I'm close to giving birth,

00:04.320 --> 00:07.360
so I made some homemade chicken stock to pop in the freezer.

00:07.360 --> 00:10.120
I let all of that simmer for about three to four hours

00:10.120 --> 00:12.200
while I prepped all of my other dishes.

00:12.200 --> 00:15.180
I started off by making some raspberry crumble bars.

00:15.360 --> 00:18.880
I baked my crust while I got started on my raspberry topping.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.040
Once the crust was baked,

00:20.040 --> 00:21.560
I spread all of that on top,

00:21.560 --> 00:24.000
sprinkled some of my oatmeal mixture on top,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.200
and then let that bake for a little longer.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.280
Once that was cooling,

00:27.280 --> 00:29.820
I decided to prep some smoothie bags.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.880
I did a heavy metal detox one with banana, cilantro,

00:32.880 --> 00:33.880
wild blueberry,

00:33.880 --> 00:35.240
and then I've been loving mango,

00:35.240 --> 00:37.280
so I made some mango ones as well.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.760
I made a quick vanilla peach puree

00:39.760 --> 00:41.760
and just let the peaches simmer on the stove

00:41.760 --> 00:43.620
while I made my oatmeal bake.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.920
This is a staple in our house.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.200
We have this a lot.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.520
So I made a double batch,

00:47.520 --> 00:50.900
baked that for 30 minutes, and then let that cool as well.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.080
When prepping salads,

00:52.080 --> 00:53.920
I make sure that they store really well.

00:53.920 --> 00:56.640
So today we did a Brussels sprout and kale salad.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.080
I shaved some Brussels sprouts

00:58.080 --> 01:00.360
and then added all my other ingredients to a bowl

01:00.360 --> 01:03.540
and top that with a miso Calabrian chili dressing.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.520
I also like having protein on hands,

01:05.520 --> 01:09.080
so I seared off some skirt steak That I marinated the night before,

01:09.080 --> 01:12.600
and let that rest while I moved on to making my last dish,

01:12.600 --> 01:14.580
which was a Thai fried rice.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.720
Used up a bunch of veggies we had in the fridge,

01:16.720 --> 01:18.120
so it was Napa cabbage,

01:18.120 --> 01:20.560
some broccolini, scallions, chili.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.360
I just scrambled some eggs,

01:22.360 --> 01:23.400
took those back out,

01:23.400 --> 01:25.200
and then sauteed all of my vegetables.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.700
Before adding my rice and my sauce.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.720
Give that good mix,

01:28.720 --> 01:30.480
and obviously had to taste test.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.280
I blended up my peach puree,

01:32.280 --> 01:35.720
and then bagged up my raspberry crumble bars.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.040
These are so handy to have just throughout the week as a little snack.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.920
I leave my oatmeal bake in the tray,

01:40.920 --> 01:42.600
just cover it with plastic wrap.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.120
My steak. We had half of the fried rice for lunch,

01:45.120 --> 01:48.080
so I backed up the other half, and then moved on to my salad.

01:48.080 --> 01:48.880
In the meantime,

01:48.880 --> 01:51.360
lucky was straining my broth for me,

01:51.360 --> 01:52.520
so I put that away.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.280
And I don't like prepping a lot of food,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.720
because I get over the flavor of things really quick,

01:56.720 --> 01:57.610
so this was perfect.
