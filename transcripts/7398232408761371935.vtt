If you got these super cute lights from the TikTok shop,

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.841
when you get them, remember,

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:07.501
you need to press them down in the middle

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.920
to kinda help them splay out and be cute.

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.161
Otherwise you just have like,

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:14.841
a little ball, a cluster of lights,

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:16.941
and instead of the kinda cute

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.920
whimsical look that they're meant to give.

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:21.681
So just a little tip, you just give them a little help,

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:26.341
press them, and then that's when they become kind of floppy in the wind.
