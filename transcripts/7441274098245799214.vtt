00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.240
We can't have sugar for breakfast this time.

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:05.801
No. You want them?

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.601
You can have them for a snack later today,

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:10.381
but for breakfast, you can have an egg and yogurt and bananas.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.080
Yeah, that's how it's gonna have to be.

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:13.841
Today is Monday,

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:16.761
so Mondays I do a reset of the house because I take Sundays off.

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:19.341
So let's get started. Today I made these brownies,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.160
and they are so good.

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:23.801
My husband took half of them to work with him today

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:24.841
because they are just that good.

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:26.441
And it is from time and tenderness.

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:29.861
Victoria on here. Her recipe is phenomenal.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.640
One

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.660
fire at a time.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.700
I'm a red pajama waiting. Waiting for his mama.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.020
My blanket.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.649
It's a jingle bell. Jingle bells.
