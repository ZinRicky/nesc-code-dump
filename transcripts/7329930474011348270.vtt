00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.520
Now we're gonna have a little lesson in critical

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.760
thinking skills.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.320
I did not compare being a stay at home mom

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.780
to doing math.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.540
What I said was,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.440
if my friend is going to make a bad choice,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.380
I'm going to let her know, hey,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.900
I think that's a really bad choice.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.180
So in the same way that being a stay at home mother

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.800
and choosing to give up

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.360
all participation in the real fucking world

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.500
so that this other person can excel in that world

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.520
with no fucking protections for yourself,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.000
that's a really stupid fucking decision.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.920
I don't support that.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.220
Not for one second.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.080
Same thing if my friend came to me

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.120
and had another stupid decision that she was gonna do

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.360
that could have negative effects on her life.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.680
It's called an analogy.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.200
Sometimes people make metaphors.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.840
It is not a direct comparison.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.040
It is a similar event

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.400
to show you where the similarities lie.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.680
Is a stupid fucking decision to be a stay at home mom

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.440
and give up everything to support somebody else equally

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.440
as much as it's a stupid fucking decision

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.180
to give up your whole life for drugs.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.680
It's called critical thinking.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.020
Let's get on it, okay?
