00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.040
There's nothing like having to enjoy dessert

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:03.161
that's filled with corn syrup

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:04.801
and way too much refined sugars.

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:05.561
I don't know about you,

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:08.081
but I like to enjoy dessert that makes me feel good afterwards,

00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:09.161
adding to my vitality

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:11.681
rather than potential diabetes or chronic disease.

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:15.001
This pecan pie. I'm starting out by making buttery crust from scratch

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.641
using glyphosate free, regeneratively grown primitive wheat.

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:20.681
I'm killing two birds with one stone by making double crust.

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:22.121
After chilling the dough for one hour,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.721
I roll it out on a flowered surface,

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.881
rotating each time to avoid sticking.

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:26.961
Although I was meticulous,

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:29.201
I rolled it out too thin. This crust was a shame,

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:31.521
so I stuck it back in the fridge and used my second crust,

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:33.441
which went quite well on round two.

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:36.121
Using my rolling pin, I unrolled the crust onto my pie dish,

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:37.801
then crimped the edges using my thumb,

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:40.201
and placed the crust pressed into the freezer for one hour.

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:42.401
During this time, I chopped the pecans for the filling

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:44.161
and made my syrup of browned butter,

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:45.361
maple syrup, and cream.

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:48.521
Next, I created the remaining filling of coconut and maple sugars,

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:49.961
pasture raised eggs, vanilla,

00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:52.241
and salt. I carefully drizzled in the hot syrup

00:00:52.242 --> 00:00:54.561
while whisking constantly to avoid curdling the eggs.

00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:57.041
I added my chopped pecans to my frozen pie crust,

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:58.161
poured the filling over top,

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:00.361
and decorated with pecan halves before baking.

00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:01.481
After cooling overnight,

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:04.601
we cut into this delicious pecan pie with nourishing ingredients.

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:05.921
This crust was flaky and buttery,

00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:08.156
and the filling was crunchy and slightly chewy.
