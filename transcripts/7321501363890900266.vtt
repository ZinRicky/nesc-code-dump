00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.640
I don't know who needs to hear this

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:03.761
but they're not your soulmate

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:04.561
you're just bored

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:05.361
they're not perfect

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:07.281
you just have to clean your fridge for three hours

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:09.441
and do a deep clean of your apartment um

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.521
start playing guitar

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:12.321
develop a hobby that's not really on your screen

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:12.921
get off your phone

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:14.381
you've been on your phone for too long

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.960
get off get off

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:17.761
it's warping your perspective

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:20.121
sometimes it's just really not that deep

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:22.081
just give your brain something else to do

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:24.639
don't let your crush turn you into an iPad kid
