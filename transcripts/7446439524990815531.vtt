00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.120
It's Monday morning. This is usually my reset day.

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:04.921
I got really shitty sleep last night.

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:07.841
Very tired. I'm very over, um,

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:10.521
leaving my house. I'm gonna cave for the next several days.

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:13.881
But I wanted to pop on here and talk about my last video,

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:16.601
which was basically being kind of surprised

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:19.121
how many people are shocked and offended

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:23.801
by other people celebrating the death of the United Healthcare CEO.

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:26.481
So I wanted to explain my position a little bit further.

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:29.281
I'm not personally celebrating this man's death.

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:30.601
Let's get that out of the way.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:32.881
I don't think I would ever personally celebrate someone's death.

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:34.621
Hmm. There's a few exceptions.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.120
However, my previous video wasn't about my Celebration.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.601
It's about me understanding why people are celebrating.

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:43.221
And let's be serious for a second.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.640
This is historically accurate.

00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:48.801
This has happened before. Right off the top of my head,

00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:51.861
I'm thinking the bullshit revolution and the French Revolution.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.980
When you allow greed at the high level of class systems,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.560
whether that be monarchy or,

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:00.921
in this case, capitalism,

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:05.421
when unchecked greed leads to the suffering of a mass populace,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.360
the populace will rise up.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.921
And I grew up around wealthy people,

00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:12.441
and I still am afforded a,

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:14.081
like, a really comfortable life.

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:15.741
Okay, I don't wanna live through revolution.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.880
But in order to maintain the status quo,

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:21.641
in order to maintain your position at the top of a social system,

00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:23.921
like a class system, um,

00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:25.681
you can't just shit all Over everybody.

00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:27.721
Constantly over time,

00:01:27.722 --> 00:01:31.161
over and over. Because eventually people will have nothing to lose.

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:34.221
And that's where you're seeing the people celebrating

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.360
instead of being smart and maintaining a thriving middle class

00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:40.621
where people can work for a good wage

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920
and afford the things that they wanna afford,

00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:44.641
maybe have some good time off,

00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:47.081
maybe a vacation once, twice a year.

00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:50.721
The unchecked and unregulated greed of some of these corporations,

00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:53.861
and in specifically the healthcare industry,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.080
which directly contributes.

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:58.361
Directly, not like in between.

00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:02.501
Middle man directly contributes to the death of people in this country.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.720
The created. They created the monster that's going to eat them,

00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:11.141
which is angry people who have suffered for a long time.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
Do you hear the people saying,

00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:16.841
we have seen this before? Which is why I'm not surprised,

00:02:16.842 --> 00:02:20.181
I'm not shocked. This is kind of what I saw coming.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.400
And I think a lot of people have seen this coming.

00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:24.061
And I don't think it's over.
