00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.400
so I'm getting a lot of comments like this that are like okay

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:04.820
but what do we do though

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.280
and I'm not gonna pretend that I have a step by step plan

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:09.080
for how to overthrow the patriarchy

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.600
all I was saying in that last video

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:15.820
is that we're not gonna actually end violence against women by like

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.120
creating a “female only” whatever the fuck that means

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.360
um society or like

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:25.000
“female separatism” as one of my comments said like

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.320
this concept of like

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:32.080
the only way to protect women is to just completely separate women and men

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:34.280
like that doesn't make any sense

00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:36.720
but I will tell you with 1,000% certainty

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.360
even though I don't have like

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:40.800
a laid out step by step plan

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:44.560
for what we in America can do today to overthrow the patriarchy

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:50.280
I will tell you that as long as capitalism exists um

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:52.860
the patriarchy will also exist

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.280
like capitalism is the thing that allows men to oppress women

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.520
the class that the gender binary deems to be man

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:04.220
you know and the class that is deemed to be woman

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.080
um this is something else

00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:07.800
the gender binary like

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.000
this whole concept of the gender binary and why

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.240
like queer liberation and like

00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:15.860
the liberation of women um

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.800
these things actually go hand in hand

00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:21.000
they're one and the same because the sheer concept of like

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:21.840
the gender binary

00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:26.080
the concept of heterosexuality and of being a heterosexual versus a homosexual

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:27.280
like these were all

00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:31.760
things that were created to maintain the hierarchy of man over woman

00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:34.320
um they were created to maintain this

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:35.840
like nuclear family unit

00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:38.900
this traditional system of marriage um

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.840
which you know

00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:45.600
it's an explicitly Marxist belief that the traditional marriage system is like

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:46.640
a form of like

00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:49.240
bourgeois social control anyway

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.680
sorry I don't wanna ramble and ramble in this video um

00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:53.480
so I'm gonna put on the screen like

00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:54.600
a list of like

00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:56.120
explicitly Marxist feminist

00:01:56.121 --> 00:02:00.080
like anti capitalist feminist readings and um

00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:03.040
you guys can leave comments and I can make smaller

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:05.000
shorter videos um

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:05.776
okay bye
