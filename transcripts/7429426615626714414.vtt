00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
So this is officially my second fall date night outfit.

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:05.641
I went out last night.

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:09.321
I wore these both times because I thought they were gonna be a gimmick.

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:09.761
These, like,

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:12.301
fleece line tights looking leggings.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.440
They are not. I love these things.

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:17.201
I'm gonna wear them all the time apparently.

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:19.241
But I'm getting ready to go out with my hubby

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:21.221
and now I'm gonna be toasty warm.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.500
so I'm going with like this headband and some matching earrings.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.920
And then I need to pick out the purse.

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:30.281
I've got this one by Fable England.

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:33.481
Really cute. Very much color matches the top.

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:36.661
And then we just have a vintage Louis Vuitton.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.480
So we're gonna have to find out.

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:40.561
I decided to go with the fable England

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:42.841
because I think it just ties all the colors together.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:46.981
And that's full day night.
