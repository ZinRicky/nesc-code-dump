00:00.080 --> 00:03.120
Here are the things I prepped to make breakfast a lot easier

00:03.121 --> 00:04.601
and quicker in the mornings.

00:04.602 --> 00:06.901
Started off by prepping some bagels.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.960
I made my dough earlier that morning and let it rise.

00:09.961 --> 00:10.921
Once it was done,

00:10.922 --> 00:13.041
I punched it to release all the air

00:13.042 --> 00:15.301
and then form them into my little bagels.

00:15.520 --> 00:16.520
While I was forming them,

00:16.521 --> 00:20.081
I heated up some water and honey on the stove to drop them into

00:20.082 --> 00:21.481
and boil them really quickly

00:21.482 --> 00:24.641
before pulling them out and adding some toppings.

00:24.642 --> 00:28.361
I pop those in the oven and got started on making some apple sauce.

00:28.362 --> 00:32.560
I've been craving apple sauce so much lately and my kids love it.

00:32.561 --> 00:36.601
Always have it on top of waffles or pancakes, so I made extra this week.

00:36.602 --> 00:39.321
I also had some strawberries that I wanted to use up,

00:39.322 --> 00:41.041
so I added those in as well.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.521
I boiled my apples on the stove

00:42.522 --> 00:45.001
with some water and sweetener until they were soft

00:45.002 --> 00:47.881
and added in my strawberries before blending it up.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.701
You can get it to whatever consistency you like.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.720
At this point my bagels were done baking,

00:52.721 --> 00:56.701
so I let them cool on my wire rack while I got started on making some

00:56.720 --> 00:59.840
Savo waffles. These are gluten free and dairy free.

00:59.841 --> 01:02.881
I started making them when I was struggling with eczema a lot,

01:02.882 --> 01:06.401
so they've just become a staple in our house because they're so good

01:06.402 --> 01:08.661
and I prefer them over normal waffles.

01:08.840 --> 01:11.040
And to make a blueberry Compote every week,

01:11.041 --> 01:13.061
so that's what I did today as well.

01:13.080 --> 01:16.680
I let that cool and made some pickled onions and jalapenos.

01:16.681 --> 01:18.801
I use my mandolin to slice them.

01:18.802 --> 01:20.321
Added some smashed garlic,

01:20.322 --> 01:23.501
my vinegar mixture, and also some chili flakes.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.520
That good mix and set that aside.

01:25.521 --> 01:27.241
Even loving breakfast potatoes

01:27.242 --> 01:30.161
so I also wanted to add something savory.

01:30.162 --> 01:33.441
I fried up some sausage and added broccolini to that,

01:33.442 --> 01:36.521
and then fried up my potatoes and onions separately.

01:36.522 --> 01:38.941
While that was going, I made a quick PICO.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.560
Goes really well with the breakfast potatoes and sausage,

01:41.561 --> 01:43.401
but also on some breakfast tacos.

01:43.402 --> 01:46.501
I put that in little glass containers to cool off

01:46.520 --> 01:49.360
and waited until they were cold enough to pop a lid on top.

01:49.361 --> 01:51.001
But this is everything I prep.

01:51.002 --> 01:54.522
I love having both sweet and savory options to grab in the morning.
