00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.900
RV Airbnb Part 2.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.300
My husband so graciously dug all the trenching

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.020
for water and power.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.940
Now I just need to lay the lines

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.100
while we still have the mini excavator.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.060
My husband cleared the spot,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.980
and then I asked him to go back over a few times to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.960
make it nice and flat.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.740
The ground, please.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.760
Then we picked up a pallet

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.540
of dormant Bermuda grass from a local grass farm.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.280
Here I'm having the kids trying to help me,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.840
and they were super excited to help.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.140
Um, help lasted about five minutes before they got bored,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.760
but we did get all the grass put down.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.420
Um, this will look nice and green once so it comes down.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.480
Can't wait for spring.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.120
I see Zinya's banana plants and elephant ears.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.040
I just can't wait for it.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.780
Here are some of the listing images,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.840
and I am gonna replace that mattress

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.680
because it's super fun

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.940
waiting for a new one from Amazon. Um,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.120
but here she is,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.260
and I cannot wait to have our first guest on the farm.
