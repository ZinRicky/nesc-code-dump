00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.600
what do homeschoolers do at 8:00am

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:02.720
they make their own breakfast

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:03.640
of course that's a lie

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:04.920
normally they're still asleep

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:05.880
but for some reason

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:08.600
my kids got up at 7:00am this morning and we're ready for breakfast

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:11.480
by last year I gave them the responsibility of getting their own breakfast

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:13.280
I do snacks lunch

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:15.760
dinner all of things they can get their own breakfast in

00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:16.960
my daughter Learned how to make eggs

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:20.600
and then we always have easy breakfast things on hand like cereal muffins

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.160
bananas yoghurts

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:23.000
those types of things

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.760
but this morning they wanted to learn how to make scrambled pancakes

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:26.360
so Mama had to

00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:28.160
usually only have to help them two or three times

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.200
before they can do it on their own

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:30.760
this has really saved me as a homeschool mom

00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:33.200
because so much of their day to day responsibilities fall on

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:35.880
and this has been an easy way for me to have a slow and quiet morning

00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:37.400
and they have some responsibility for this

00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:38.720
but this didn't just happen overnight

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:41.660
it took a lot of time and practice of learning things in the kitchen

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.880
but also learning about food that feels their body

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:46.160
because we all know that when mom is not on top of it

00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:48.560
they are gonna grab the sugary treats and all of the junk

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.400
so for one we just don't buy that stuff

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.840
so it's not a temptation and 2

00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:54.640
I taught them about proteins and fats and nutrients

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:56.440
and all the things that make our bodies feel good

00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:58.560
most of us who grew up in the 90s and early 2

00:00:58.561 --> 00:00:59.560
surrounded by diet culture

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:00.920
have a bad relationship with food

00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:03.160
and that's not something I want my kids to ever experience

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:06.440
and even now we're learning so much about all of this crap that's in our food

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:07.400
and how it's all bad for us

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.920
but that is a conversation for another

00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:10.520
we put a huge emphasis on fruits

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:12.120
veggies and animal products in our house

00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:13.760
and that's just naturally what our kids go

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:15.480
I have no idea how I got down that rabbit hole

00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:18.270
but I just hope that you all have a fantastic Wednesday
