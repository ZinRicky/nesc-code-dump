00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.380
So I've wanted to do this for years

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.820
and recently I was on Netflix

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.900
and I came across like a crime docu series on Lacey Peterson.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.280
Lacey Peterson was like

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:14.421
8 months pregnant when her husband murdered her.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.340
All of this took place in California.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.000
The material point is that everybody knew about this case.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:20.601
And it's always

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:23.481
really bothered me that we have an unsolved case here in Winnipeg

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.521
that nobody talks about, nobody knows about,

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:27.921
nobody cares about other than her family.

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:29.481
And over the last 21 years,

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:34.261
I have consistently shared the story of Sylvia Ann Gibosch

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.160
every time I'm asked to speak on m, m,

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:36.561
I, W,

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:37.701
G. To us.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.480
On June 13th, 2,003,

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.821
Sylvia Anne Gibberish, 20 years old,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.700
was eight months pregnant with her second child when she disappeared.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.260
We know that she grew up in Swan River, Manitoba.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.900
She moved to Brandon.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.640
She gave birth to her daughter, Tina,

00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.461
her first baby in Brandon.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.360
We know that Sylvia went to visit her family in Swan River

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:05.461
around Christmas 2,002,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120
and that was the last time they ever saw her.

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.321
Sylvia came to Winnipeg

00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:13.501
and there's conflicting information on whether she came

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.480
to Winnipeg to be with her partner

00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.821
or to get away from, from him.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.220
We know that she was staying on Furby Street

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.900
and her sister Nicole

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.440
has said that she got involved with some people that were

00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.921
maybe not good for her. Sylvia's mother,

00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:33.281
Merna reported her missing in October of 2,003.

00:01:33.282 --> 00:01:35.841
And at the time I was working at Southern Chiefs Organization.

00:01:35.842 --> 00:01:37.441
And I remember still to this day

00:01:37.442 --> 00:01:40.321
very clearly reading the article on her disappearance

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:42.761
and the way that she was negatively constructed

00:01:42.762 --> 00:01:44.641
like so many other indigenous women.

00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:46.481
And I remember thinking like,

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:50.741
is like nobody caring? Like where's the urgency to this?

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.620
The headline dehumanized her.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.800
We know that there's like

00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:57.921
a huge difference in the way that indigenous women are portrayed

00:01:57.922 --> 00:01:59.041
and constructed in the media

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:00.521
when they go missing or are murdered.

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:03.941
We're blamed for that violence compared to other people.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.140
It has been 21 years since Sylvia's disappearance.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.120
Sylvia deserves justice. Her mum and her sister deserve justice.

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:17.901
And they deserve to know what happened to their daughter and sister.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.240
With another m m I W

00:02:19.241 --> 00:02:20.761
G 2 US family member,

00:02:20.762 --> 00:02:22.561
uh in Manitoba, Bernice Catchaway,

00:02:22.562 --> 00:02:26.641
whose 18 year old daughter Jennifer Catchaway disappeared in 2,008.

00:02:26.642 --> 00:02:28.801
And she always says and I quote,

00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:30.521
she's been saying this for years,

00:02:30.522 --> 00:02:32.661
someone knows something.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.860
Someone knows what happened to Sylvia and Gibosch.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.860
Someone knows the details of her disappearance.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.780
Someone knows who more than likely harmed her.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.620
And maybe all of these years later,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.860
you are at a place now where you can share these details

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.400
or any information that you might have

00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:00.181
big or small.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.920
So I'm asking you to reach out to the Winnipeg Police Service

00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:07.281
or if you'd rather not do that,

00:03:07.282 --> 00:03:09.581
feel free to reach out to me directly.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.680
I know that Our special advisor,

00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:16.021
Cora Morgan would be more than willing to sit down and chat with folks.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.840
Manitoba has some of the highest levels of numbers of m, m,

00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:21.361
I, W,

00:03:21.362 --> 00:03:22.381
G, 2 s.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.860
Many of them are unsolved.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.800
And for years,

00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:32.541
I've said that we have individuals walking on our streets,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.460
walking around in our communities

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.120
that pose a significant threat to indigenous women,

00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:40.541
girls and 2 spirited

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.920
who are involved in the disappearance and or murder of Manitoba

00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:47.641
Indigenous women,

00:03:47.642 --> 00:03:51.701
girls and two spirited. Somebody knows something on these cases.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.840
Seven years later, after the disappearance of Sylvia Ann Gibosch,

00:03:55.841 --> 00:04:01.201
her cousin Amber Gibosch went missing in 2,010.

00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:05.521
That's one family. We have so many families that have multiple

00:04:05.522 --> 00:04:08.001
missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.

00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:13.101
So I'm asking folks to find the courage to come forward.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.020
Families deserve justice. They deserve closure.
