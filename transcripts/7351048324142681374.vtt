00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.600
It has been a while since I have talked about Elevation,

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:03.641
Bethel Hillsong,

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:04.721
those types of churches.

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:07.281
And so this video popped up for me today, um,

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:08.001
with this comment.

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:09.881
And so I just kind of wanna talk about a little more.

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:12.521
I have never personally attended Stephen Verdict's church.

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:13.081
However,

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:18.021
I have been influenced significantly by non denominational churches,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.140
mega churches,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.840
and I have listened to Stephen Furdick sermons a lot in my life.

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:26.401
Problem with Steven Furdick is he's very charismatic,

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:28.041
and he's a very gifted communicator,

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:29.981
which is why he's so dangerous.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.520
Verdict teaches modalism.

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.641
He has said, god broke the law.

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:34.081
These things are heresy.

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:36.961
They're not in the realm of orthodox Christianity.

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.001
While those are a significant problem,

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.801
the biggest problem I have

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:43.881
is that they never give you a full gospel presentation.

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:46.001
These types of churches usually say, oh,

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:47.481
because god loves you so much,

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:49.241
and he just wants a relationship with you,

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:52.521
and all you gotta do is just have faith and you'll be great.

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:53.841
And while, yes,

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:56.181
faith is a huge part of our salvation,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.640
it. That's not the full gospel.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:59.561
But here's the bad news.

00:00:59.562 --> 00:01:02.001
The bad news is that each and every one of us

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:04.521
have sinned against a holy and just god,

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:06.041
and therefore we are condemned.

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:07.361
We cannot save ourselves,

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:08.801
we cannot atone for our own sins,

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:11.341
and therefore, we need a savior.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.080
Here's the good news is that Christ,

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.881
being merciful and kind and loving towards us,

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:17.561
Took our sin upon himself.

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:19.401
He lived a perfectly sinless life.

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:21.701
He became sin who knew no sin.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.020
Was crucified,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.920
died, was buried.

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:26.761
And he was resurrected on the third day.

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:30.361
So that you and I can have the gift of salvation.

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:32.281
And it is a free gift of salvation.

00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:33.781
It is not one you can mere.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.520
You cannot do enough good deeds to earn salvation.

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:38.441
You cannot say a prayer to earn your salvation.

00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:43.221
It is only the gift of god to you if you believe in him.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.040
Salvation is not a reward for the righteous.

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:47.361
It is a gift for the guilty and for the condemned.

00:01:47.362 --> 00:01:50.121
And so that is why I will continue to talk about Bethel Hillsong

00:01:50.122 --> 00:01:51.721
elevation. These types of churches.

00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:54.863
Because they preach a damnable gospel that does not save.
