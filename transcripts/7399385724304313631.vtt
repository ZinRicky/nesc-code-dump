I'm not sure who needs to hear this,

00:01.361 --> 00:04.261
but abortions and miscarriages are very different things.

00:04.320 --> 00:05.560
Anytime an election is about to happen,

00:05.561 --> 00:08.001
I see so much misinformation about this topic.

00:08.002 --> 00:09.601
A few years back, I had a miscarriage,

00:09.602 --> 00:12.641
and after a little while, I had to go get a DNC procedure done.

00:12.642 --> 00:16.161
I remember the doctor walking in with all these tools and forceps,

00:16.162 --> 00:19.281
and he had to remove my baby piece by piece.

00:19.282 --> 00:21.201
Was devastating. It was horrible,

00:21.202 --> 00:22.561
but it was something that needed to happen

00:22.562 --> 00:24.521
because my baby was already deceased.

00:24.522 --> 00:25.441
The DNC procedure

00:25.442 --> 00:28.041
is something that is often used in late term abortions.

00:28.042 --> 00:29.441
So what people will do is they'll say,

00:29.442 --> 00:32.481
if you are voting against being able to do that procedure

00:32.482 --> 00:33.881
in the later stages of pregnancy,

00:33.882 --> 00:35.601
whether or not your baby is alive,

00:35.602 --> 00:37.521
you must be against it at any point.

00:37.522 --> 00:40.241
And you were there for hurting women who are having miscarriages.

00:40.242 --> 00:42.361
It seems like such an obvious lie,

00:42.362 --> 00:43.881
but a lot of people fall for it.

00:43.882 --> 00:45.801
To me, it's kind of like the term burial.

00:45.802 --> 00:47.241
It's like if we lived in a different world

00:47.242 --> 00:48.721
and a group of people came along and said,

00:48.722 --> 00:51.041
you know what? We need to ban burying people alive.

00:51.042 --> 00:53.601
You can't do that. It would be extremely dishonest for people then

00:53.602 --> 00:55.561
to go tell their friends, did you hear about this law?

00:55.562 --> 00:56.201
They wanna make it

00:56.202 --> 00:58.601
where you're not even allowed to bury your loved ones after they die?

00:58.602 --> 00:59.481
Anymore, yes,

00:59.482 --> 01:01.441
technically it is the same process,

01:01.442 --> 01:03.841
but doing it to somebody who is deceased is very,

01:03.842 --> 01:06.441
very different than doing it to somebody who is still living.

01:06.442 --> 01:08.321
That's how it is with abortion and miscarriage.

01:08.322 --> 01:09.361
If you wanna be pro choice,

01:09.362 --> 01:11.121
if you wanna be pro abortion, fine.

01:11.122 --> 01:13.281
But stop using women who have gone through miscarriages

01:13.282 --> 01:14.361
and who have gone through loss

01:14.362 --> 01:16.321
as a way to justify legalized abortion

01:16.322 --> 01:17.481
across the board, at any time,

01:17.482 --> 01:20.068
for any reason. It's dishonest and it is disgusting.
