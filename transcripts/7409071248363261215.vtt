00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
I am here to tell you, if you're miserable in your marriage,

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:06.721
you do not need to stay just because you have kids.

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:10.321
You can leave, you can start a whole new life.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:12.881
You can get to play with makeup again

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:16.121
and go to concerts and do all kinds of fun shit.

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:18.061
So whoever the fuck is telling you

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.400
that you need to stay in that marriage,

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:22.081
that's what you decided. You decided to be a mother

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:23.361
and this is your life now.

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:27.041
They could all shove it. Cause I promise you,

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:28.961
you only have one fucking life

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:32.161
and you either live it or.

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:34.621
Or what? Or what?
