00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.380
some of us might be getting confused by what princess treatment is

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.000
princess treatment isn't in the gifts that he buys you

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:09.440
if he pays for your nails

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:12.920
if he pays for your hair takes you on lavish shopping trips

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:16.440
or takes you on vacation that is not princess treatment

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:20.520
real princess treatment is in the way he holds you emotionally

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.440
Does he validate you emotionally

00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:24.074
is he genuinely kind 

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:27.420
Does he actually care when you get upset and cry

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.400
He doesn't let you go to bed upset

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:31.240
He doesn't raise his voice at you

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:33.600
he's soft and gentle with you

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.320
that is princess treatment

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:36.480
yeah gifts are nice

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.680
most women are happy when you do gift them things

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:42.200
however I wouldn't consider that princess treatment

00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:46.673
Real princess treatment is in his emotional maturity
