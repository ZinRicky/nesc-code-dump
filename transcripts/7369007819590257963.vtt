00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.320
Hi, I'm Aria.

00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:02.601
I'm a child wife, content creator.

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.861
And today I wanna talk about cosplaying.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.680
I realize I'm probably not changing anyone's mind on this subject,

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:10.281
but I just wanted to touch on it a little bit

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:13.161
because I get the whole cosplaying thing a lot

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:15.461
and I just wanna talk about it.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.760
My main point here,

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.361
if you wanna stop now,

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:23.101
is that just because my realistic is not your realistic

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.060
doesn't mean that it's fake.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.620
For example, I love skirts and dresses and twirly.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.440
Everything twirly. And bows.

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:36.281
And I'm super feminine and I love that.

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:38.541
And I wear skirts and dresses everyday.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.000
You probably don't.

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:41.601
You might wear jeans everyday,

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:43.381
you might wear a suit everyday.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.560
Okay, that's your real.

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:48.141
That's your life.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.520
This is my life.

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:50.801
That's just me.

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:52.501
I love it. Makes me happy.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.040
If wearing jeans makes you happy

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:56.081
as much as wearing skirts make me happy,

00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:57.901
then I am happy for you.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.140
Same with my lifestyle.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.340
The bread winner,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.040
stay at home

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:05.641
mom or wife kind of dynamic of the family is very normal for me.

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:06.761
It's been that way for my mom,

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:07.401
for my grandma,

00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:08.121
for my great grandma,

00:01:08.122 --> 00:01:08.761
for my great aunts,

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:11.481
my aunts. That's the norm for my family.

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:13.861
But that might not be the norm for your family.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.760
But like I said,

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:19.101
just because my norm is not your norm doesn't mean it's fake.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.760
I love talking about my life and I encourage questions in the comments.

00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:23.081
I'd Love to talk to you about this,

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:26.721
but I just want to encourage you to maybe think

00:01:26.722 --> 00:01:29.342
before you jump to the conclusion that something is a cosplay.
