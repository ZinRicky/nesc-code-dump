00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
We just got home from vacation,

00:01.601 --> 00:05.461
and while unpacking, I realized that we didn't have any deodorant.

00:05.560 --> 00:06.960
When I mentioned that to lucky,

00:06.961 --> 00:09.201
he said he was gonna make some really quick.

00:09.202 --> 00:12.961
Started by combining all the ingredients that needed to melt together,

00:12.962 --> 00:16.721
which was some beeswax, few tablespoons of coconut oil,

00:16.722 --> 00:18.481
and then some cocoa butter.

00:18.482 --> 00:21.321
After all the ingredients were combined in the bowl,

00:21.322 --> 00:25.961
we moved over to heating them up on the stove until they were melted.

00:25.962 --> 00:29.241
While those were melting, he combined all of the dry ingredients,

00:29.242 --> 00:31.381
which were some baking soda,

00:31.400 --> 00:33.720
aero root powder, and since he's a baker,

00:33.721 --> 00:36.601
he needs everything leveled and very precise.

00:36.602 --> 00:38.481
He combined those two things in a bowl

00:38.482 --> 00:41.221
and then realized that he needed a bigger bowl.

00:41.280 --> 00:41.760
At this point,

00:41.761 --> 00:45.161
he poured all the melted ingredients into the dry ingredients,

00:45.162 --> 00:48.781
making sure to mix it really well until it formed a paste.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.040
Once it came together, he scooped it into two different bowls.

00:52.041 --> 00:54.121
Since he was making two different scents,

00:54.122 --> 00:55.921
one for me and one for him.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.481
I wanted a lavender scent,

00:57.482 --> 00:59.981
and he went with a eucalyptus scent.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.560
Once all of that was combined,

01:01.561 --> 01:04.441
he scooped it into these little glass jars,

01:04.442 --> 01:08.581
making sure to clean up the rim before closing them up ready to use.
