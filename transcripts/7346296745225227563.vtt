00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.320
So I actually do touch on this topic a little bit

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.480
in the interview that I did

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.880
with the new station that's gonna be airing tonight.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.760
I didn't go super in depth into it because,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.440
you know, it's nightly news in a public forum in a conservative state.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.560
All right? I don't need Pitchfork showing up at my house.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.680
But the idea that if you ban TikTok,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.760
a social media platform,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.560
you are somehow going to squash the revolutionary ideals

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.120
that are already being shared on it

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.600
is laughable. First of all,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.680
every revolution in history pre internet era

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.920
took place with the organization of paper and pencil

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.380
and word of mouth.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.840
Obviously, with social media, those ideas can spread quicker,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.800
but they are not gonna stop being spread.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.820
They will just be moved over to a different venue.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.600
Look at all the right wingers when, like,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.440
Twitter was having a goddamn meltdown.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.280
They went on to like, freedom social.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.040
You cannot stop ideas.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.640
And we have a constitutional right to free speech

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.160
as well as free assembly for that reason.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.360
Because all the patriots in the government should know that

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.400
revolution is the foundation on which our country was founded.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.378
It's the American way.
