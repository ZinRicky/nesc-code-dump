00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
So the next time a man insults you,

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:05.081
what I want you to do is instead of receive that and, like,

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:06.061
internalize it,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.760
realize

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:09.881
what they're doing is pointing out something that makes you unique

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:11.801
and different from other people,

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:12.441
whatever it is.

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:15.501
Like, they love to call me a great old lady,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.980
but the amount of men that fucking drool

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.880
when they see a little bit of grain.

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:23.341
Oh, she's a mature woman,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.720
you know what I mean?

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:29.401
There is somebody that finds you, you, exactly how you are attractive.

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:31.761
You can watch the show my 600 pound life

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:34.081
and see that every single one of those people

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:35.341
with all of their

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.900
not just physical differences.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.080
And I'm not saying that fat is ugly and skinny is pretty.

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:41.881
What I'm saying is

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:44.961
there's just so many examples of couples that you're like, wow,

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:47.321
I never would have thought that person would have, like,

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:50.521
a capacity to have a romantic relationship in their life

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:52.161
with everything else they have going on.

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:54.221
Like there's that couple, squirmy and grubs.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.820
Um, just like,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.080
there's gonna be somebody that loves you when you love yourself.

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:02.761
When you realize you are beautiful.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.601
The things that make you a little bit different

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:06.101
that people are pointing out,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.600
those are the things that make you beautiful.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.261
So you're a little bit rounder.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.960
So many people love that.

00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:14.441
The skinny girls wish they could put on a little bit more weight.

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:16.841
The heavier girls wish they could Lose a little bit of weight.

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:19.081
The curly girls straighten their hair.

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:21.241
The girls with straight hair spend their time curling their hair.

00:01:21.242 --> 00:01:26.081
Like, just literally embrace the things that make you you

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:28.636
and watch how fucking happy you get.
