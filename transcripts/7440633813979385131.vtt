00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.280
I've been working with the cast of Little House on the Prairie

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:10.680
for a little over a year and I have been working primarily with Dean Butler

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:14.900
best known as Almanzo/Almonzo Wilder

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.480
on Little House of the Prairie

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:17.940
he marries Laura

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.880
this is me and Dean last week at Silver Dollar City

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:23.880
I run all of his social accounts

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.500
so I've been doing that for the last year

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.640
and if you don't follow him here on TikTok

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:32.560
he's almost at 100,000 which was our goal for this year

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:37.180
he's almost at 100,000 and we started him last year with absolutely no followers

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.320
I'm very very excited for him

00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:41.800
and then he also has Instagram and Facebook

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:44.020
and I've been running all of that for the last year

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.560
and then here's Linwood Boomer

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:50.480
who played Adam Kendall and Dean with myself

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:53.240
this was in March of this year

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:57.400
they had a massive 50th anniversary festival in Simi Valley

00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:01.040
California that was literally a dream come true

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:06.440
let me show you who else I got to meet is one of my all time favourite photos

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.000
this is me and Karen Grassley

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:12.300
who played mall we wore the same cardigan that day

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080
and she had thought cause she didn't have her cardigan on

00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:20.400
she thought that I had taken her cardigan out of her bag and was like

00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.320
halfway through the date darling

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:24.240
she's darling I'm gonna need that back

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:25.080
and I was like Karen

00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:27.100
this is mine and she was like

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.860
and she opened her bag we put on the cardigan

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.940
posed for this photo I mean iconic

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.400
this is me with the sweet Landon children

00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:38.840
this is Leslie Landon Michael Landon's daughter

00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:40.320
and Michael Landon junior

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:44.000
he's also the director of when calls the heart

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.640
and he's the creator of all of that

00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:49.060
and so so fun talking to them about their dad

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.000
Leslie and I have stayed in touch

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.220
and we talk monthly um

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.300
adore her love her

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.600
they're incredible

00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.400
and talking to them about their dad just makes me so emotional

00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:04.600
this is me in front of the set of The Little House

00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:06.880
they recreated the sets for The Little House

00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:09.520
the Mercantile and the church

00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:11.920
and it was just incredible oh

00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:14.140
going into 2025

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.140
there is so many things happening with the cast of Little House on the Prairie

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.720
and I'm gonna be involved in helping facilitate events going forward

00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:31.760
and I'm so excited for the cast and so excited for the fans of Little House

00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:34.040
and this is literally a dream come true for me

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:37.720
I grew up watching Little House on the Prairie with my grandparents

00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:40.240
and my grandparents's names for Charles and Carolyn

00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:43.000
so it was literally perfect

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:48.560
and being involved with such an iconic show is a dream come true

00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:51.600
that I never could have imagined this for myself

00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:52.080
but yes

00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.780
I've been doing this for the last year

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.880
next year I will be full

00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:57.360
full time Little House

00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:02.340
like everything everything in my life will be Little House next year

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.380
and I'm just so grateful for the opportunity

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.000
let me show you one more picture

00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.960
this is my sister and I with the cast of Little House

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:13.360
this picture was taken in March at the big Simi Valley event

00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:17.020
and as you can see this is iconic

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.560
literally these people are some of my closest friends

00:03:21.561 --> 00:03:24.700
and now knowing them on a personal level

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.560
like they're incredible human beings

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:31.060
and it is a joy and an honour to work alongside them

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.260
and we just have the best time
