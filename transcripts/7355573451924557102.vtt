00:01.480 --> 00:02.520
Here on the farm,

00:02.521 --> 00:04.781
the hens are laying eggs again.

00:04.960 --> 00:05.800
Usually in the winter,

00:05.801 --> 00:08.781
they take a couple months off when it gets dark early.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.580
That now that it stays lighter for longer,

00:11.960 --> 00:13.440
they're laying eggs again,

00:13.441 --> 00:14.161
which is really fun.

00:14.162 --> 00:16.861
We're eating all the egg recipes that we can think of.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.960
Today we are making a egg salad on sourdough bread.

00:20.961 --> 00:22.781
So last night, I started the bread.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.560
I just added my flour,

00:24.561 --> 00:26.341
water, salt, and starter,

00:26.520 --> 00:28.900
and then let it ferment in the fridge overnight.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.680
Then I just the next day,

00:30.681 --> 00:32.101
just dump it onto the counter,

00:32.240 --> 00:33.780
shape it into the loaves,

00:33.800 --> 00:35.480
let it sit, and then while it was sitting,

00:35.481 --> 00:36.821
I drained my eggs,

00:37.200 --> 00:40.000
added some really cold water into them afterwards,

00:40.001 --> 00:41.461
and then we peeled them.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.380
That's the girl's favorite part is peeling the eggs.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.760
Then we added, like, a vinegar,

00:46.761 --> 00:49.721
some salt, and little maple sugar to some celery,

00:49.722 --> 00:53.161
and then we let that sit in the fridge to pickle.

00:53.162 --> 00:54.401
While we finish the breads,

00:54.402 --> 00:56.181
we did a final shaping of our.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.500
Our loaves.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.560
I'm loving the high protein farm flour with the sourdough bread.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.501
I feel like it makes all the difference.

01:03.880 --> 01:07.040
Then we put the loaves in the bread or in the fridge for a little bit

01:07.041 --> 01:09.361
so they can get nice and firm for a score.

01:09.362 --> 01:10.361
Then we scored the bread.

01:10.362 --> 01:14.221
My. My goal today was to score the bread into, like a.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.140
A daffodil shape.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.560
And then while I was baking,

01:18.561 --> 01:19.801
We added some shallots,

01:19.802 --> 01:21.601
some Dijon mustard,

01:21.602 --> 01:24.461
Greek yogurt, French salt and pepper,

01:24.480 --> 01:27.340
and then we mix that up with our celery.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.120
The bread turned out beautiful.

01:29.121 --> 01:31.321
I definitely feel like it gave, like,

01:31.322 --> 01:32.361
a daffodil vibe.

01:32.362 --> 01:33.281
Daffodil vibe.

01:33.282 --> 01:34.941
So that was a success.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.720
We added the egg salad to the bread,

01:36.721 --> 01:38.301
and that's what we had for lunch.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.360
I realize, though,

01:39.361 --> 01:43.561
that I am not a raw celery person like I always try to be,

01:43.562 --> 01:45.281
but I never really am.

01:45.282 --> 01:47.681
Luckily, the kids love the egg salad, though,

01:47.682 --> 01:49.508
and they finished it up.
