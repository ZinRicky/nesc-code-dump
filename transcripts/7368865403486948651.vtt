00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.960
You probably didn't realize that you do these things in order to avoid being still

00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:06.601
or avoid your problems

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:08.561
things like mindless scrolling

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:09.981
Compulsive shopping

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.400
emotional eating

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:12.781
substance abuse

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.820
or just trying to stay busy all the time

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.280
All of these things

00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:22.121
are all strategies to avoid what's going on in our unconscious brain

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.601
things that we haven't dealt with

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:27.611
they're all strategies to avoid the unconscious things 

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:29.581
that were afraid to process

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.560
but guess what

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:31.481
They don't go away

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:35.521
The unconscious stuff isn't going anywhere unless we pay attention to it

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:37.161
You really only have two options

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:42.161
option one let those strategies continue to run and ruin your life

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:46.801
or option two: start pausing instead of distracting yourself

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:49.961
start connecting to what you're trying to feel

00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:53.841
start connecting with a discomfort that you're afraid to feel

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:57.481
You really have to change your subconscious programming

00:00:57.482 --> 00:01:00.597
in order to see real self growth and improvement
