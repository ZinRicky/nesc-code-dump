00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
So I've been doing my dishes in the shower,

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:05.161
which I feel like is a sentence just nobody should say

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:06.361
and I've had one of those weeks

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:08.121
where I feel like I'm doing a lot of stuff

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:10.121
but I have absolutely nothing to show for it.

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:12.241
We're working on two room renovations at the moment.

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:15.641
One is obviously the kitchen and I wish I could show you

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:16.681
but if I show you now

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:19.201
you're gonna be left feeling as frustrated as I am

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:21.601
because it's not ready and I have no reveal.

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.141
We were meant to be without a bean shop for one day.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.360
It's turned into two weeks

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:28.521
which is just classic renovation is always gonna happen like that

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:31.601
but still at the time it just feels like a lot

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:33.441
and meanwhile I was like, okay that's cool

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:35.161
I can't do anything in this room right now.

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:36.441
I just have to live with it.

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:38.881
Maybe I should turn my attentions to the lounge

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:41.381
because that room has been driving me nuts

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.600
and I have put

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.761
and committed to five different paint colours in that room

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:49.721
and I still like I put a colour on that I think that I gonna like

00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:52.521
and I look back at it and I just don't like it

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:55.961
so today I went out and I bought my sixth paint colour

00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:59.281
which I'm about to test out on the wall and hopefully that's the one.

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:00.721
I've got a good feeling about it

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:04.041
but I have Also had a good feeling of the other five.

00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:06.001
So time will tell. Meanwhile,

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:07.921
I'm doing all of the mum stuff, right?

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:10.821
School drop off, school pickups, lunches,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.500
dinners, activities

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.560
four out of five nights of the week.

00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:16.641
And then during the day, it's just,

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.401
there is just no time. And I always say that

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:22.121
I don't think that you can do a room renovation in one room

00:01:22.122 --> 00:01:24.361
without fucking up the entire rest of your house.

00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:26.681
So imagine the state of my house right now.

00:01:26.682 --> 00:01:29.201
We've got two rooms that are torn apart

00:01:29.202 --> 00:01:31.441
and just everything is everywhere. All,

00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:33.641
and I'm just, I'm losing my mind.

00:01:33.642 --> 00:01:35.441
I'm hanging on by the skin of my teeth.

00:01:35.442 --> 00:01:38.601
I'm feeling like I need to take my big deep breaths.

00:01:38.602 --> 00:01:41.201
And whenever I find myself in a situation

00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:43.441
where I feel like there's too much going on

00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:45.381
and I feel myself getting stressed,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.720
the only way that I know how to deal with it is to put on my lobotomy

00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:51.861
smile and tell myself that everything is fine.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.713
Everything is totally fine.
