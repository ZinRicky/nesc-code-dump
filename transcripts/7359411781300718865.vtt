00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.640
There are currently 25 active gentleman only clubs in Australia

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.561
and a lot of them have been shut down.

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:10.201
So there used to be many more.

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:13.481
In Australian Indigenous histories,

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:18.181
we know that there was always women's business and men's business.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.680
In western histories, we know that

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:23.061
men are the ones who have designed a lot of these constructs

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.760
that say women are in the home.

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:27.401
A woman's place is in home,

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.781
in the kitchen, domestic.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.360
She is a domestic, domesticated being in a property,

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:35.161
well, not even a being,

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:38.101
maybe a property, property of her husband,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.800
an object to be obtained

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:46.321
and then utilized until she is a shell of her former. Anyway,

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:47.581
I could go on.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.320
A ladies lounge is a place for women to go and drink champagne.

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:55.001
It is an art exhibition. It's not a big deal.

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:57.281
It's about equity, not even Equality.

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:59.221
It's about writing the wrongs of the past.
