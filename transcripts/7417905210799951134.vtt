00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.960
Yes, these are Bluetooth.

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:04.841
They work with Android, they work with iPhone.

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:06.481
I just connected them to my boyfriend's phone.

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:08.201
He has Android. I connected them to my phone.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:10.121
I have iPhone. They connected to, like,

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:11.481
a really older generation.

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:12.601
My daughter's old, old,

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:15.281
old iPhone. I genuinely like these.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.561
I'm happy to have them. They don't pinch my hair.

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:21.441
They don't do any of the things that other headphones do.

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:22.201
They don't, like,

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:24.721
squeeze my head. Sometimes you put them on and there's.

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:27.021
It's like they're trying to crush your head slowly,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.080
so after enough time, it fucking hurts.

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:30.001
They don't do any of that shit,

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:31.761
so I do really, really like them.

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:34.441
They move really smooth and easy to, like,

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:35.661
fold them up and shit.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.000
It's really easy to see the left and right.

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:38.921
I know that sounds stupid,

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:41.201
but it matters when you're listening to music and stuff,

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:43.381
so it's really easy to know which one's left and right.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.360
I don't know. I like them.

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:46.521
They're awesome. They work for everything.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:48.721
And they do come with the connections too,

00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:51.041
so if the Bluetooth isn't working or.

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:53.021
Or if you just like having them wired,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.140
it comes with the regular AC Jack to connect them.
