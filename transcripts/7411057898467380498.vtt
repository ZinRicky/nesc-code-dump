00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
This is just a short public service announcement to say, um,

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:10.561
a belated goodbye to all the people who unfollowed me, um,

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:12.461
for being a human being.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.720
And what I mean by being a human being is, uh,

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:24.841
caring about children, not dying in an illegal war.

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:26.741
So yeah, um,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.820
love you and really happy that, um,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.680
all of you other real, living,

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:38.301
breathing, feeling human beings are still here with me.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.300
Um, I'm sorry if I offended anyone,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.340
um,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.660
by saying that I didn't think children should be orphans,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.940
but that's not really my problem because it's not complex.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.500
It's just basic. It's basic.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.640
I haven't been posting as much lately

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:58.561
and that's because I've been taking a break,

00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:02.321
but I am still here. I'm still here for the feminist feed

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:05.858
and I can't wait to make more content with you.
