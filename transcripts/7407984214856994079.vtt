00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.880
Get ready with me

00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:03.321
as I make party food for my 3 year old's birthday party.

00:00:03.322 --> 00:00:04.801
As someone who avoid seed oils,

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:06.441
refined sugars, artificial flavors,

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:07.641
and food dyes at all cost,

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:10.201
I started in the morning by preparing my sourdough pizza

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:12.601
by freshly milling primitive wheat into whole grain flour

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:14.601
and then making with my sourdough starter,

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:16.561
which I hadn't fed in over 24 hours.

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:18.521
I covered my dough with compostable cling wrap

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:19.761
and let that ferment all day.

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:21.601
Next, I started making a birthday cake.

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.761
First, I whipped up the cake battery process that takes only 30 minutes

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.601
using eggs from my hands. While the rounds baked,

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:28.281
I whipped up some homemade buttercream icing

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:29.521
a 15 minute process

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.201
using a touch of spirulina to naturally dye it for my little boy.

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:35.161
Then I got to making a fish ceviche which included chopped tomatoes,

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:36.441
those red onions, cilantro,

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:37.561
mango, salt and pepper,

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:40.081
and lots of citrus juice. I let that marinate in the fridge

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:42.721
and continued on by making a homemade ranch dip for carrot

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:45.161
crudite taste. This dip is so good and easy to make.

00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:47.081
I just mixed together some dried spices,

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:49.241
salt and pepper, and then move that to the fridge.

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:51.441
Now it's time to shape the sourdough into pizza balls

00:00:51.442 --> 00:00:53.601
so this can rise a bit. Before making pizza.

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:55.921
I make some pickled red onions by heating some vinegar,

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:56.601
water, salt,

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:59.161
coconut sugar, and a bay leaf and then dress the big salad.

00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:00.761
I mix it With a champagne vinaigrette

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:02.601
just as the party's about to start.

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:05.641
Then I replayed the CBJ and finish it with a vinegar concoction

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:08.181
from the pickled onions and a bunch of avocado pieces.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.520
I start pumping out fresh to order pizza for the guests,

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:13.401
which cook on the outdoor grill for a perfectly crispy thin crust.

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:15.361
And I forgot to video my homemade vanilla ice cream,

00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:17.241
but this was used to accompany the birthday cake,

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:18.415
the star of the evening.
