00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.480
I made a rookie homeschool mistake

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:03.960
I forgot to lesson plan this weekend and start our Monday off with no plan

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:05.400
it's not an ideal way to start the week

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:06.280
but also not the end of the world

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:07.240
while the kids did morning work

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:08.320
I got my stuff together luckily

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.400
I do look ahead so I had a good idea what we were gonna do today

00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:11.760
I just didn't have everything prepared

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:12.680
so I had to wait honestly

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:14.960
sometimes those lessons work out better than the ones I have fully prepared

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:17.560
so for the last week I've been working on the ng confident team with math

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:19.320
I just have to say I am struggling

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:21.760
I have the hardest time making the ng sound by itself

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.040
I don't know how to do it without putting too much emphasis on the G

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:25.640
but when you use it in ng ng on your own

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:26.680
you don't over emphasize the G

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:27.800
I am just on the struggle bus

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:29.880
I need someone to teach me how to make the ng sound

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:30.840
and because I just can't do it

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:31.800
I taught it as a word family

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.040
to make matters worse Maverick has a little country twang to it

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:35.560
and he never says the G at the end of a word

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:37.240
so I'm over emphasizing and he's skipping it

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:39.486
all together we are just the dynamic duo over here
