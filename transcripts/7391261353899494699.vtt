00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
Joke. Donald Trump today was speaking at his rally.

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:04.441
Oh, my goodness. Guys,

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:06.401
whether you like Trump or not,

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:10.701
surviving an assassination attempt has been incredible

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.100
for voter approval and turnout.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.760
Whoever shot ex president Trump

00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:18.801
almost absolutely guaranteed him to win president.

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:22.201
This is absolutely crazy. Do you guys see him with his hand up,

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:25.121
or do y'all think that Trump's team staged that?

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:28.261
That was staged. That would be an all time low for Trump.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.760
Either way, this is some super juicy stuff,

00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:34.481
and I can't wait to find out more about who actually tried to shoot

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:35.033
Trump.
