00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
I think too many women get stuck in this.

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:03.361
I'm a bad bitch. I'm a bad bitch.

00:00:03.362 --> 00:00:05.341
I'm a bad bitch. Can't nobody hurt me. Nobody hurt me.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.440
That you're forgetting you're a fucking human and you have feelings.

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:12.201
And it's okay to cry. It's okay to cry that some guy hurt you.

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:14.361
It's okay to fucking admit, yeah,

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:16.961
he pumped and dumped, and here I am,

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:18.601
and now I'm crying. And it's okay.

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:20.321
Because the only way you're gonna learn from your fucking lesson

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:22.921
is if you actually admit that you had a fucking problem.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.041
If everything has gone fine for you and you're a bad bitch

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:26.401
and nothing ever hurt you, nobody.

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:29.561
You're feeling that. How are you ever gonna learn and grow?

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.801
You have to acknowledge and admit that, like,

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:33.421
I got. I got played.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.540
Damn it, that one hurt.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.480
I feel stupid. You're not stupid,

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:39.641
but you feel that way.

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:43.161
And you have to admit it and acknowledge it so you can move on from it.

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:44.701
Otherwise, it's gonna be, like,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.560
holding you back.

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.441
And you're always gonna have this little voice in your head saying, yep,

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:48.401
that one time you got played.

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:50.801
But that one time, that guy did it.

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:51.721
You gotta, like,

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:54.481
clear the shit out so you can move forward.

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:58.041
You can't move forward when you're holding onto the past.

00:00:58.042 --> 00:00:58.921
When you're, like,

00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:00.121
acting like nothing ever happened.

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:01.841
All you've done is brush it under the rug,

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:02.961
so it's still fucking there.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.461
I'm Pretty sure you're gonna have a mountain

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.820
with just a rug covering it.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.940
Do you know what I'm saying? Like it's a fucking okay.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.660
It's okay to not be okay.
