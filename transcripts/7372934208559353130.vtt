00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.880
If you think that your friends are talking behind your back 

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:03.800
or making fun of you

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:05.280
or just being haters

00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:07.240
The truth is, they probably are

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.120
That's just the reality of it

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:12.520
Your friends sometimes will be your biggest haters

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:15.000
While strangers will be your biggest fans

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.200
I'm not saying that these are good friends

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:18.860
but understanding this

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.720
will help keep your circle small

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.880
and stop putting energy into other people

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:24.960
who do NOT give you the same energy back

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:27.480
If you feel like you're not your friend's cup of tea

00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:29.154
then go find somebody else 

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:31.140
who you will be their cup of tea
