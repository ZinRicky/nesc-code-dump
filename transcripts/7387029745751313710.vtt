00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.120
It truly amazes me how many people are out running around

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:05.200
running their mouth

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.540
acting like they can take a pinch to the face

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.360
One thing that you should understand about life/world 

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:12.280
if you can't take a punch to the face

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:13.480
do not run your mouth

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:14.147
look at me 

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:17.240
does it look like I could survive a blow to my face?

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:19.380
no I Learned, I'm smart

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.200
I learned to hold things in

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:23.241
I grew up with a lot of sisters 

00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:26.240
and an older sister who would literally beat me up

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:27.601
to oblivion so I know 

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:29.520
I can't take a blow to the face

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:32.320
I will run, I will just shut my mouth

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:34.360
but more people need to understand

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:36.070
if you can't take a blow to the face

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:37.704
zip it just shhh 

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:38.785
you know what I mean?
