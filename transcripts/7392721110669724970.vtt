00:00.000 --> 00:03.320
My husband mentioned that he was craving Coca Cola the other day,

00:03.321 --> 00:04.801
and since we were out of soda,

00:04.802 --> 00:07.041
I decided to make him some today.

00:07.042 --> 00:11.241
I started by making my caramel sugar by combining some water and sugar,

00:11.242 --> 00:13.321
letting that come to the hard crack stage

00:13.322 --> 00:15.881
before pouring it out and letting it cool.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.361
Once it was all cooled down,

00:17.362 --> 00:21.841
I broke it up and set it aside and moved on to zesting my citrus.

00:21.842 --> 00:24.241
I started by zesting some oranges,

00:24.242 --> 00:27.821
some lemon, and lastly I also zested some lime.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.780
I moved on to grinding up all of my spices.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.760
I started by combining some nutmeg, cinnamon,

00:33.761 --> 00:35.841
some vanilla, coriander seeds,

00:35.842 --> 00:37.481
rose hip, some lime leaves,

00:37.482 --> 00:41.201
and some coconut before grinding that into a fine powder.

00:41.202 --> 00:43.481
I combined the last round of ingredients

00:43.482 --> 00:45.981
which were some water with different sugars,

00:46.120 --> 00:47.920
citrus that we zested earlier,

00:47.921 --> 00:51.121
and we can't forget about our citric and malic acid

00:51.122 --> 00:53.761
and also the caramel sugar we made earlier.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.361
I set that into a water bath

00:55.362 --> 00:56.961
and let that all come together

00:56.962 --> 00:59.041
for about an hour and a half on the stove

00:59.042 --> 01:01.741
before straining it through a fine mesh strainer.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.160
Pop that in the fridge until it was cold

01:04.161 --> 01:05.801
and then it was time to have our soda.

01:05.802 --> 01:08.641
I combined some Cola syrup with sparkling water

01:08.642 --> 01:11.081
and this tasted exactly like Coke,

01:11.082 --> 01:12.441
and when I made lucky a glass

01:12.442 --> 01:15.861
he was so impressed that he had to have another glass after.
