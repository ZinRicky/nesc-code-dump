00:00.080 --> 00:02.160
My baby just got home from the hospital,

00:02.161 --> 00:04.721
and one thing that she has been asking me to make

00:04.722 --> 00:08.481
is chicken noodle soup. So today I decided to make it for her.

00:08.482 --> 00:10.241
I started by making my stock.

00:10.242 --> 00:13.361
So I cut up some carrots, some onions,

00:13.362 --> 00:14.361
some celery,

00:14.362 --> 00:19.121
and set that aside while I got a big pot out to put my chicken in.

00:19.122 --> 00:20.161
Use the whole chicken,

00:20.162 --> 00:23.501
but you can add whatever parts of the chicken you have laying around.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.760
I add all of my vegetables to the pot,

00:25.761 --> 00:29.681
alongside some herbs and also a few cloves of garlic.

00:29.682 --> 00:31.961
I fill up my pot with some cold water

00:31.962 --> 00:35.001
before putting the lid on and letting that simmer away.

00:35.002 --> 00:39.321
After about an hour, I pull out my chicken and get the meat off,

00:39.322 --> 00:41.281
shred the meat and set that aside

00:41.282 --> 00:43.601
and return the carcass back to my broth

00:43.602 --> 00:45.721
to simmer for another hour or two.

00:45.722 --> 00:47.161
Once that was almost done,

00:47.162 --> 00:50.641
I started on my soup, sliced up some celery,

00:50.642 --> 00:53.681
some carrots, and also diced up some onion.

00:53.682 --> 00:56.001
At this point, it was time to strain my broth,

00:56.002 --> 00:59.161
so I used a fine mesh strainer to get everything out,

00:59.162 --> 01:02.241
and then I added my vegetables to a separate pot,

01:02.242 --> 01:03.921
sauteed them for a couple minutes

01:03.922 --> 01:06.481
before adding my broth and letting that simmer.

01:06.482 --> 01:09.681
In the meantime, I got started on making my egg noodles.

01:09.682 --> 01:11.921
I combined some eggs, some milk,

01:11.922 --> 01:14.201
whisked that up before adding some flour,

01:14.202 --> 01:16.881
and then kneading my Dough until it came together.

01:16.882 --> 01:18.761
I let that rest for about 10 minutes

01:18.762 --> 01:22.281
before rolling it out and cutting it into little squares,

01:22.282 --> 01:24.181
or might I say rectangles?

01:24.240 --> 01:25.880
Dropped them into my hot soup,

01:25.881 --> 01:29.241
let them boil for about two minutes before it was time to plate.

01:29.242 --> 01:31.361
I topped it with some parsley and lemon,

01:31.362 --> 01:33.541
and she absolutely loved it.
