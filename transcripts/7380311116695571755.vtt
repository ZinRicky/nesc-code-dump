00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.960
so I posted on Instagram and Twitter about like

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:05.800
not being sure who I'm gonna vote for in the election

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:06.800
right because like

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:08.000
what the fuck is gonna happen November

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:09.600
I don't know obviously

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.280
obviously I do not want Trump

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:13.940
the way in which Democrats are going about talking about

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.200
you know  🍉 and Joe Biden's hand in it

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:18.480
like they're so divorced from reality

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:19.960
these guys literally in my reply saying

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:21.160
well I'm #free🍉 too

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:21.640
but like

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:22.680
we gotta vote for Joe Biden

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.480
it's like I don't think you guys understand that

00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:26.520
like I'm watching every single day

00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:28.120
like children that look like my family

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:28.760
like my cousins

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:29.720
I'm Arab like

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.680
people that look like they could be related to me

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:33.520
being murdered every single day

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:34.800
gside every single day

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.320
babies — every single day

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:37.640
children being disabled everyday

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:38.280
like I

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:39.520
this is not like a

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:40.200
you know like

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.400
a far away issue for me

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:43.040
I see these people and I'm like

00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:44.320
they could be related to me

00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:46.200
this is what my family looks like

00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.920
this is just like a campaign talking point

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:49.320
like this is people's lives

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:50.240
this is people's lives

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:53.200
and there is such a callous disregard for people's lives

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:56.680
and such an inherent selfishness coming from their Democratic Party

00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:57.320
sorry

00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:01.000
that I am grappling with the moral decision of what I'm gonna do in November

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.520
because I cannot so easily dismiss the fact

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.440
that there are people being genocided in another country

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:07.840
at the hands of the United States government

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:11.600
because I don't wanna risk my quality of life doesn't mean that I want Trump

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:12.920
I know what Trump was

00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:15.600
I spent the entire four years that he was president

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:16.920
talking about what Trump was doing

00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:18.200
I'm very aware

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:19.360
the fact that despite that

00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:22.160
I still have this much resistance towards Biden should tell you something

00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:22.920
and everyone's like

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:23.960
well what about the Supreme Court

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:24.640
what about abortion

00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:25.240
and it's like

00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:27.000
what has happened under Biden

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.520
Biden has not done anything to help either of those issues

00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:31.460
know what the Republicans wanna do if they win

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.800
obviously I don't want that

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:36.540
but the fact that y'all don't understand why this is so difficult and complex

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.280
and you think it's like this easy decision oh

00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:39.040
I'm gonna vote for Biden

00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:42.800
and guilting people into voting for Biden instead of pushing Biden to do better

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.360
is not gonna give you the outcome you want

00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:46.440
look I truly think he's gonna lose regardless

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:48.360
because millions of people are feeling this way

00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:49.080
and when he loses

00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:50.960
it will not be the fault of the people that didn't vote for him

00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:55.120
it will be the fault of Biden and the Democrats for not earning people's votes

00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:56.080
for supporting this gside

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.840
this isn't just like some political talking point 

00:01:57.841 --> 00:01:59.040
these are people's lives

00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:01.520
so I apologize if I'm still having this moral dilemma

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:03.960
but if you find it easy to just vote for the gsidal maniac

00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:06.440
it means you don't really fully understand what is happening

00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:08.920
this issue isn't actually impacting you the way that you think it is

00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:12.160
and I have never felt this helpless in my entire life

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:14.320
and I wish that y'all would step away from your fucking keyboards

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:14.800
for a little bit

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:15.680
to understand

00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:18.600
the actual human lives are being affected by this in 🍉

00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:19.880
it's not just this like

00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:22.240
hot button topic that we're talking about on the internet again

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:23.280
these are my people

00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:24.240
like these are Arab people

00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:25.000
they're my people

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:27.115
angel to watch the way that you guys are speaking to Arab people
