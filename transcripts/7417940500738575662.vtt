00:00.000 --> 00:00.960
I was in a silly,

00:00.961 --> 00:04.681
goofy mood this morning and decided that I wanted to go shopping.

00:04.682 --> 00:06.201
I usually don't treat myself,

00:06.202 --> 00:09.841
so lucky insisted I go. I didn't know exactly what I wanted,

00:09.842 --> 00:11.761
but I knew I wanted to see their bags,

00:11.762 --> 00:14.381
so they showed me a bunch of different options.

00:14.480 --> 00:17.000
I usually stick with very classic colors,

00:17.001 --> 00:19.741
but this matcha green was so beautiful.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.800
There's just something about green bags

00:21.801 --> 00:24.721
that are kind of intriguing to me going into fall.

00:24.722 --> 00:26.661
This one was another classic.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.640
Coming back to the green one,

00:28.641 --> 00:31.441
I was so indecisive and couldn't make my mind up.

00:31.442 --> 00:33.521
I kept going back and forth so long

00:33.522 --> 00:35.481
that lucky fell asleep on the table,

00:35.482 --> 00:38.721
which gave me even more time to try on clothing options.

00:38.722 --> 00:40.441
I went with the yellow fur coat,

00:40.442 --> 00:44.701
this brown bag, this wine red pouch for all of my chargers.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.080
Also picked lucky up a little surprise that he didn't know about

00:48.081 --> 00:49.501
since he was sleeping.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.360
He's been using the same card holder for years now,

00:52.361 --> 00:55.121
so I decided to get him a new little wallet.

00:55.122 --> 00:56.921
While he was transferring his cards,

00:56.922 --> 01:00.361
he showed me all the little notes that I wrote him that he keeps,

01:00.362 --> 01:02.301
which made me so emotional.
