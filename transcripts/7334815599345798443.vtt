00:00.080 --> 00:02.240
Here's all the food I made my husband for

00:02.240 --> 00:03.240
Super Bowl Sunday.

00:03.240 --> 00:05.720
I started off by making myself a blueberry

00:05.720 --> 00:06.920
thyme mocktail,

00:06.920 --> 00:09.120
and then I pickled some green cabbage.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.160
So I sliced it really finely with my mandolin,

00:12.160 --> 00:13.200
added some jalapenos,

00:13.200 --> 00:15.360
and then topped it with my vinegar mixture.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.640
I had my dough rising for a couple hours.

00:17.640 --> 00:20.060
Since I was making some burger buns,

00:20.240 --> 00:21.640
I cut those up

00:21.640 --> 00:23.360
and then form those into little balls

00:23.360 --> 00:26.320
and let those rise for another one to two hours

00:26.320 --> 00:27.600
just until they were soft.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.520
In the meantime,

00:28.520 --> 00:31.340
I got started on making some pretzel bites.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.000
Absolutely loves pretzel bites,

00:33.000 --> 00:35.720
so I knew that these had to be on the menu for tonight.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.120
So I made the dough,

00:37.120 --> 00:39.540
covered that until the gluten relaxed

00:39.600 --> 00:41.480
for about 15 to 30 minutes,

00:41.480 --> 00:43.360
then I rolled it into little ropes,

00:43.360 --> 00:44.740
cut my little bites,

00:44.840 --> 00:48.480
and then they went into my water with some baking soda.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.040
After 10 to 15 seconds,

00:50.040 --> 00:51.640
I popped them on the baking sheet,

00:51.640 --> 00:52.720
sprinkle them with salt,

00:52.720 --> 00:55.260
and then bake them until they were golden brown.

00:55.320 --> 00:58.000
When it was time to bake my little brioche burger buns,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.580
I topped them with my egg wash and some sesame seeds,

01:01.840 --> 01:03.640
and once they were all baked,

01:03.640 --> 01:05.640
I let them cool completely,

01:05.640 --> 01:08.520
and then I moved on to my chicken wings.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.120
I covered them in seasoning

01:10.120 --> 01:12.860
and then pop them in the oven for about an hour

01:13.200 --> 01:15.400
while I made a little side salad.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.440
I wanted Something refreshing

01:17.440 --> 01:19.200
to cut through all my other flavors.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.360
So I decided to make a blood orange fennel salad

01:22.360 --> 01:24.400
with a mustard vinaigrette.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.400
I set that aside while I started on my patties.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.960
I wanted to keep them simple,

01:28.960 --> 01:32.140
so I made a cilantro cumin Patty

01:32.440 --> 01:35.580
with some caramelized onion cheddar on top.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.640
I cut my buns in half,

01:37.640 --> 01:38.760
put the Patty on top,

01:38.760 --> 01:39.960
and assembled my burger

01:39.960 --> 01:41.600
with some arugula,

01:41.600 --> 01:42.680
pickled cabbage.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.220
And you cannot forget crispy onions.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.480
And I dust my wings

01:46.480 --> 01:48.740
and my buffalo sauce. I made,

01:48.880 --> 01:49.920
added some parsley.

01:49.920 --> 01:52.600
Also made a white cheddar sauce for my pretzel bites.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.940
And this bread was gone in an hour and a half.
