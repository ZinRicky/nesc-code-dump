00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.600
Making liquid way at home is so easy.

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:06.161
All you need is cheese cloth or like, cotton,

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:08.601
two Mason jars or something similar,

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:14.121
some stick of sorts to hang your cloth above a bowl.

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:18.021
This is just like a cotton scarf that I had in my closet.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.640
Be careful without overflowing.

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:21.841
Fill your keeper to the top.

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:23.801
But in my case, I needed a finer strain.

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:26.621
So I doubled up on fabric to get a clear end product.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.720
Twenty four hours later,

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:33.521
you're gonna have this thick cream cheese like substance.

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:35.161
You just add salt, herbs,

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:37.521
whatever you want. Store it in the fridge and use it as like,

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:40.361
a cream cheese spread that's super rich and probiotics.

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:43.121
And then the liquid that's gonna be left over in the bowl

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:46.240
is gonna be a liquid way. My liquid gold.
