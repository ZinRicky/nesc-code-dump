00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.040
nothing blows my mind more than the fact that people will literally

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:08.181
refer to abortion as a topic that is like a difference of opinion

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.960
50,000 women die every single year from lack of access to abortion

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:18.761
unsafe abortions kill that many women every single year

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:21.021
those are preventable deaths

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.100
abortion bans increase the maternal mortality rate by 21%

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.400
and here's even more mind blowing part all in pursuit of a policy

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:32.641
abortion bans

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:35.201
that doesn't even reduce the abortion rate

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.341
it increases the abortion rate

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.940
like all in pursuit of not meeting your policy on goal

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.460
that many women every single year

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.880
all in pursuit of a policy

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:53.161
that does the exact opposite of what it purports to do

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:56.061
and that's this year's hottest debate
