00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.700
I'm just gonna say it,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.540
but being a stay at home mom is easy.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.040
Can we just say that being a mom,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.720
period, is hard work?

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.760
It's not easy.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.720
Working mom,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.600
stay at home mom,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.400
they're both hard jobs.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.660
Because being a parent is a hard job.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.840
Having a three day weekend

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.720
is not the same as being a full time stay at home mom.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.960
It's just. It's not.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.500
It's like apples to oranges.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.780
You have multiple people in your home helping you,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.380
which most stay at home moms don't have.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.160
You can get all your tasks done in a day

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.000
because you're not doing enough.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.440
You're doing the bare minimum

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.180
of what it takes to run a home efficiently.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.160
Um, and that's fine.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.520
Like, sometimes the bare minimum

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.340
in certain seasons of life is needed,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.340
especially if you've just had a baby.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.760
But being a stay at home mom

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.920
is much more than just doing your daily chores

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.360
and keeping your kid healthy,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.700
safe, and happy.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.120
I don't like speaking on parenting topics personally

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.720
because I only have one child

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.360
who is almost a year and a half old,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.220
and she, ha ha,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.880
is very different than what she was when she was

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.120
six months old.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.700
Extremely different.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.520
Very defiant,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.600
has a fiery spirit.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.520
I like it in her. But, um,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.180
no, they're not the same.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.420
Different seasons of life come,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.660
and you will learn that

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.560
when they're able to walk and get into things

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.000
and do all the Things that the toddler stage brings. Um.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.300
You might change your tune.
