00:00.000 --> 00:01.960
Cinnabon is vile. It's not.

00:01.961 --> 00:05.501
I stand by it. But I do love cinnamon rolls.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.640
So we got all these cinnamon rolls to try.

00:08.641 --> 00:10.281
These are my favorite ones.

00:10.282 --> 00:11.601
Already had. What?

00:11.602 --> 00:13.741
How many did you have? Like, three today.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.520
These are all the ones that I wanted to try.

00:19.521 --> 00:21.341
So we had the original ones,

00:21.560 --> 00:22.720
but these are, like,

00:22.721 --> 00:25.081
different flavors. We got them at a little bakery,

00:25.082 --> 00:27.481
and these are my absolute favorite ones.

00:27.482 --> 00:29.921
American cinnamon rolls could never. Okay.

00:29.922 --> 00:32.155
Yes, they can. Cinnabon.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.400
These don't have any frosting on it,

00:35.401 --> 00:37.461
so that's the issue.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.840
This is just the plain one.

00:39.841 --> 00:42.021
Okay. We have multiple different ones.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.760
These are my favorite ones.

00:43.761 --> 00:45.601
I think about them every time.

00:45.602 --> 00:47.161
But let's see what else we have.

00:47.162 --> 00:48.281
Okay. Chocolate.

00:48.282 --> 00:54.121
And then this one is. Got so much personality today. This.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.341
Let me take it out.

00:55.880 --> 01:00.380
Chocolate and vanilla. Absolutely not.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.500
Strawberry. Strawberry.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.660
Try again.

01:06.880 --> 01:07.860
Apricot.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.720
Apricot. How'd you get apricot from that?

01:10.721 --> 01:12.981
This is white chocolate and raspberry,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.020
which I'm very intrigued by.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.440
This one I'm a little apprehensive about.

01:18.441 --> 01:20.961
It's pumpkin something.

01:20.962 --> 01:23.001
I'm not quite sure exactly what it is,

01:23.002 --> 01:25.601
but doesn't scream like my cup of tea.

01:25.602 --> 01:27.201
But they said it was a really good one.

01:27.202 --> 01:29.401
So you wanna start with. I will start with.

01:29.402 --> 01:30.801
This is what we're gonna start with.

01:30.802 --> 01:32.381
We're gonna start with the worst.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.500
So, pumpkin.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.020
Okay.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.260
I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.340
It's too big of a bite. Cheers.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.300
Haha.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.500
No one Out of 10,

01:49.200 --> 01:52.100
what do you rate it? 3. Okay.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.920
I don't think we got the raspberry.

01:57.921 --> 01:59.381
I got it. You did?

01:59.720 --> 02:03.100
Hundred percent. What do you rate this one, though? Did you rate it?

02:05.200 --> 02:08.440
Let's try the chocolate. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate.

02:08.441 --> 02:09.821
Or chocolate desserts.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.000
Oh, I'm a little nervous.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.421
Are you shaking any boots?

02:16.240 --> 02:17.860
Alright, this one has potential.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.920
Hmm. I like it.

02:23.921 --> 02:26.841
Quite chocolatey. Need a drink to cleanse my palate.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.901
I read that. Cleanse your palate, babe.

02:30.040 --> 02:33.540
What do you rate it? Uh, five.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.840
I'm not a big fan of these.

02:34.841 --> 02:36.021
I'll be honest with you.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.960
5 5 as well. And you know that this one's gonna slap.

02:39.961 --> 02:41.561
This is the star of the show.

02:41.562 --> 02:45.261
Okay. Sometimes I feel like if classics are done well,

02:45.440 --> 02:47.120
you don't need to deviate.

02:47.121 --> 02:48.441
This one's just beautiful.

02:48.442 --> 02:51.781
Okay, we've already had three of these today.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.540
Good. Isn't that stunning?

02:55.160 --> 02:56.460
Hmm.

02:57.760 --> 03:02.380
A 7. A solid 7.3621.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.720
I rate it a 9. This is so good.

03:04.721 --> 03:06.261
It's good. It's just.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.834
And also needs to be warmed up.
