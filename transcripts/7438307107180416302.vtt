00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.840
this comment is such a good example of the Dunning Kruger effect

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.200
if you don't know what that is

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:06.014
let me explain 

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:08.240
The Dunning Kruger effect is a cognitive bias

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:12.300
where people with very little knowledge or expertise in a particular area

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.280
are much more likely to be confident

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:17.280
and overestimate their abilities in that area

00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:20.340
basically being uninformed leads to over confidence

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.280
and then as you acquire knowledge on the subject

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:24.680
you are more likely to become less confident

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:27.760
because you start to realize how much there is to know about that subject

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.780
and you start to realize how much you don't know

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.680
so here I was

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:34.520
talking about a very persuasive book on misogyny by Professor Kate Manne

00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:37.720
when this commenter commented to tell me that it was “nonsense”

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:38.920
I commented back and said

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:42.060
you should read the book and then come back and tell me if it changed your mind

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.800
they confidently responded that they refuse to engage with books on this subject

00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:49.000
and that the solution is somewhere else

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.280
I talk about feminism and the law on my page

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:55.000
so the Dunning Kruger effect is always in my comments

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:56.060
but um

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.680
I wanna hear from you like what

00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:59.120
do you have an expertise in something

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.000
or does this happen a lot on your page too

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.120
what are you talking about

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:03.693
tell me where you see this happening
