00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.360
This is the insane story about how I started working

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.200
for Dean Butler,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.340
aka Almanzo Wilder from Little House on the Prairie.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.280
I have made a lot of content surrounding Little House.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.720
I grew up watching them, and then

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.000
when I Learned that the cast was coming to Oklahoma,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.480
I knew I had to try to do a collaboration with them.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.760
And next thing I knew,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.140
I was hanging out with the cast for a whole weekend.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.040
There was Nelly,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.280
there was Almanzo,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.900
there was Miss Beetle,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.960
and it was a wild experience.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.160
Everyone was so kind

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.120
and made Jake and I feel like we had known them

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.360
our entire lives.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.640
As the weekend went on,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.640
Dean and I had several

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.720
conversations surrounding social media,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.640
and I said, Dean,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.600
you really need a social media presence.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.120
There are so many people that would love to follow you

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.440
and hear all of your stories about Little House.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.320
So he hired me on the spot,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.480
and I became his social media manager,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.220
and I've traveled to a few events with him so far.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.800
We are having so much fun,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.000
and I am just so grateful

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.840
for the opportunity to work with him.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.160
He has such a heart to keep

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.600
the Little House legacy alive,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.094
and I'm so grateful to have a small part in that.
