00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.560
I know it's gonna be a lazy home school day when my day starts with a little guy

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:04.480
in my day I need a full 8 hours of sleep to function

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:06.040
and I definitely did not get that last night

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:08.280
so I am dragging today it's often rainy and overcast

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:11.200
which is not helping so we enjoyed a really slow morning with Christmas music

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:12.600
decorating and some outside time

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.080
and then we were all ready to jump into our day

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:16.400
we do block schedule so today was math history in bio

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:18.440
I often get asked if I double up on math and reading lessons

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:19.360
I only do it twice a week

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:21.600
and the answer is no because I do not care about getting through my curricule

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:24.120
the goal is mastery so I do a lot of activity that cover the same task

00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:25.840
so I'll teach a new concept and model it for them

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:27.720
and then we'll do a gamer activity and practice it together

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.000
and then they'll practice it by themselves

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:30.840
and then we also review things we've already covered

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.680
so I usually spend about an hour to an hour and a half

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:33.880
teaching that subject each day

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:36.040
this helped my kids master concept so much faster

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:38.440
but I couldn't go that deep if I did reading and math in the same day

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:40.510
so that is why I split them up and do block scheduling
