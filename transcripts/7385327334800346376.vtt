00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.760
I feel like no matter how hard I try,

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:04.201
my house is always a tip and let's be expected

00:00:04.202 --> 00:00:07.281
given that children are messy and husbands are oblivious.

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:09.841
But we're about to walk into a long weekend from Matariki

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.121
here in altar on New Zealand

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:12.721
and there is absolutely no way

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:15.001
I'm celebrating Maori New Year in a messy house,

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:18.241
mainly cause I just like to relax and enjoy the festivities.

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:19.561
I mean, it's not gonna happen,

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:20.801
but dreams are free, right?

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:22.841
Matariki is super special in this country

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:25.201
because it signifies the start of the Maori New Year.

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:26.961
It's a time to reflect on the past,

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:29.001
celebrate the present and make plans for the future.

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.081
And personally, I love giving my home a big

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:32.281
deep clean prior to this

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.921
because it feels like it's really clearing out any old energy

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:36.441
and making space for what's to come.

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:37.201
But I tell you what,

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:39.961
the craziest shit always happens to us around this time of the year

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:42.681
and I swear it's because of Matsuriki's new beginnings.

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:44.081
By the way, I didn't have the time,

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:46.361
energy or the facts to give to iron my tablecloth,

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.081
so please don't be upset. Anyway,

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:50.601
so this time last year, we had just moved into this home,

00:00:50.602 --> 00:00:54.401
took us a full nine months to sell our previous house and it was a lot.

00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:56.801
But then one day actually on my son's birthday,

00:00:56.802 --> 00:00:57.961
this house got listed

00:00:57.962 --> 00:01:00.161
and it was going to auction on my brother's birthday

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:02.681
and I thought Wow, those dates seem synchronicitus

00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:05.441
and somehow we managed to snag this absolute dream home

00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:07.801
and it was a good reminder to trust the timing of your life.

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:09.801
Fast forward a year and a lot has happened.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.001
There's been a lot of cleaning,

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:14.361
a lot of renovating, and a lot of really good quality family time spent.

00:01:14.362 --> 00:01:16.521
And to me that is the thing that makes me happy.

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:18.361
And this is gonna sound super fucking corny,

00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:21.721
but I don't even care. My only goal in life is to lead a happy one.

00:01:21.722 --> 00:01:23.821
It's not how it looks, it's how it feels.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.280
By the way, I fully intended to come on here and talk about my cleaning

00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:29.001
as I do on all of my clean dogs,

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:30.961
but the Matariki Spur has got me.

00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:32.881
So now we are reflecting. And on that note,

00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:34.081
I actually have some tea to spill.

00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:35.721
I've never said this publicly for safety,

00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:37.041
but for the last 13 months,

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:39.521
my husband's been working almost three hours away

00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:41.881
and spending most of the week away in another city.

00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:43.761
And after I've spent so many long days

00:01:43.762 --> 00:01:45.921
and even longer nights flying solo with the kids,

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:48.681
he's finally finished up with that role and I'm so happy

00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:51.761
and I like to think we have Martin Icky Magic to thank for that.

00:01:51.762 --> 00:01:52.521
For my other news,

00:01:52.522 --> 00:01:55.401
I decided to push myself completely out of my comfort zone

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:57.241
and go on a reality TV show.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.921
For some reason it's called the traders.

00:01:58.922 --> 00:01:59.921
It was super challenging

00:01:59.922 --> 00:02:02.882
and you can watch me struggle on TV three from July 1st.
