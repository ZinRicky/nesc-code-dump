00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This morning, my toddlers requested some corn flakes for breakfast,

00:03.001 --> 00:04.961
but I don't usually keep those in the house,

00:04.962 --> 00:06.721
so I just decided to make them.

00:06.722 --> 00:08.281
I combined some cornmeal,

00:08.282 --> 00:12.481
corn flour, and a tablespoon of coconut sugar with some water

00:12.482 --> 00:14.821
until it was batter like consistency,

00:15.320 --> 00:17.760
then line my baking tray with some Parchment paper.

00:17.761 --> 00:20.001
Before pouring my mixture onto it,

00:20.002 --> 00:22.601
I made sure to spread it as thin as I could.

00:22.602 --> 00:23.881
Thinner you get this batter,

00:23.882 --> 00:26.161
the crispier your corn flakes will turn out.

00:26.162 --> 00:28.841
And I popped it in the oven for about 15 minutes

00:28.842 --> 00:32.361
before pulling it back out and breaking up my pieces.

00:32.362 --> 00:32.881
At this point,

00:32.882 --> 00:34.081
it's still very soft,

00:34.082 --> 00:36.121
so it's easy to rip everything apart

00:36.122 --> 00:39.101
and get it into the shape and the size that you want.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.640
I was done ripping all of them up.

00:40.641 --> 00:44.241
I popped it back in the oven for about 50 minutes to an hour

00:44.242 --> 00:45.881
at a very low temperature.

00:45.882 --> 00:48.081
Once they were all cooled down and crispy,

00:48.082 --> 00:51.241
I poured my toddlers some cereal into their bowls.

00:51.242 --> 00:53.921
Today was a day that they wanted milk with their cereal,

00:53.922 --> 00:57.241
so I poured some milk on top, and their breakfast was done.

00:57.242 --> 00:59.121
I've been on a real cornflake kick lately,

00:59.122 --> 01:01.501
so this is very exciting for them.
