00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.000
we have this tiny RV Airbnb at the farm here

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:02.720
we have a bit of a problem

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:05.340
we have a Starlink that pushes our Wi Fi down to the RV

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.160
since spring we've had some issues with the signal cause of the trees grew

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:11.200
so I'm gonna use this mini handheld chainsaw to cut some trees in

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:13.840
my husband deployed and I could not get the chainsaw started

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:17.160
so this is the perfect tool for anyone who just can start a chainsaw

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.780
or just doesn't wanna bother doing that

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.540
this made light work of cutting down these small pine trees

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.600
it was lightweight easy to use

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:25.120
it comes with two batteries

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:29.060
and I did about 50 trees and I was doing the first battery

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.800
I also messed around with changing up the tank before I started

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.340
so I knew what I was doing and it was super easy to do

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.182
now we have a better signal to the RV and I guess they're happy
