My eczema has been flaring up so bad postpartum all over my hands,

00:05.041 --> 00:06.121
on my face,

00:06.122 --> 00:10.241
and if something is wrong with my gut, that usually reflects on my skin,

00:10.242 --> 00:11.921
so I tend to flare up.

00:11.922 --> 00:17.741
I love how taking seed just supports my gut health and fixes things.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.340
I take the DSO1 Daily Synbiotic.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.340
It's a 24 strain probiotic blend

00:24.400 --> 00:27.480
which I've tried a bunch of different probiotics

00:27.481 --> 00:29.581
and I always come back to see

00:29.640 --> 00:31.720
since it's the most effective.

00:31.721 --> 00:36.061
And I see an improvement in my skin when my gut gets healed.

00:36.320 --> 00:40.120
So if anyone is struggling with eczema or other skin problems

00:40.121 --> 00:41.581
or even just floating,

00:41.760 --> 00:43.120
it would be worth it

00:43.121 --> 00:48.301
looking into your gut health and it and trying out a probiotic.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.000
Mmm.
