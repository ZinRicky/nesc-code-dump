00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
I just got done making the kids a snack plate for lunch.

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:05.001
And if you are a fellow gluten free family,

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.761
I wanna put you onto something.

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:10.021
We love just easy gluten free meals.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.440
And this pizza from Costco,

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:14.761
the sabotage or however you say it,

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:17.281
is the best gluten free pizza that we have ever tried.

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:18.942
And it's pretty reasonable at Costco.
