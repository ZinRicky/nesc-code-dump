00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
I am not informed enough to talk about it in a meaningful.

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:08.381
You cannot keep using I'm not informed

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.740
as a reason to not speak out about a genocide

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.160
seven months into it.

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:17.961
If October 2023, last year.

00:00:17.962 --> 00:00:18.561
Look, um,

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:20.301
I'm not informed. Okay?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.040
Take. Take a week,

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:23.161
a couple of days,

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:24.981
a couple of weeks to inform yourself.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.480
Seven months. We're in may of 2024.

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:30.821
When you platform of hundreds of thousands,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.540
millions, or multiple millions of people,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.540
you do not have the ability and privilege to say, um,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.480
I'm not educated,

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:40.201
I'm not informed.

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:42.881
I can't talk about, because at the very least,

00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:46.721
if you yourself do not have the language or capacity,

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:48.081
which I disagree with.

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:51.321
I think that everyone has the capacity to inform themselves

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:52.441
if they so choose.

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:55.121
There are countless of educators

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:59.321
who have come online to explain the issue in the most simplest terms

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:00.881
that even anyone with a small,

00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:01.601
little, tiny,

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:03.041
tiny brain could understand.

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.481
You are more than capable of educating yourself.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.921
And this I'm just a little comedian act,

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:09.641
it does not. I don't know what you're doing.

00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:10.801
But even if.

00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:15.681
Even if you were so unintelligent and unable to communicate a thought,

00:01:15.682 --> 00:01:17.541
which, again, you are not,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.440
you are more than able to share and amplify the voices

00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:24.221
of people who are smarter and more educated on the topic than you.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.220
Even when I'm at a place where I don't know what there is left to say,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.060
there are still People saying things that need to be amplified.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.080
And what is the point of having a platform if you cannot,

00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:37.141
at the very least,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.920
lend that platform to the people that are doing, educating,

00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:41.961
that are doing the work,

00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:44.761
that are doing the things to help those that are suffering right now?

00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:46.441
I hate this little oh,

00:01:46.442 --> 00:01:49.721
I'm so weak and I'm so uneducated and I'm so stupid routine.

00:01:49.722 --> 00:01:51.341
No, you are not.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.920
Stop infantilizing yourself

00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:56.001
and educate yourself on something that is happening right now

00:01:56.002 --> 00:02:00.101
in the world, is affecting tens of thousands of people.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.920
Be an adult and learn about the world.

00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:04.424
God, it's pathetic.
