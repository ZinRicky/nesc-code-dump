00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
Said this, uh,

00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:02.201
before, but I think that silent

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:05.321
saying women is the worst mistake that Donald Trump ever made.

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:07.121
This person to have outplay Donald Trump is.

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.201
Is. Is a porn star.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:09.161
He's a, uh,

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:10.321
cheating pig. Um,

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:11.841
that's the best case scenario right now.

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:13.801
The worst case scenario is that,

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:15.521
you know, we don't know what these women know

00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:17.361
that Donald Trump doesn't want us to know.

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:19.721
It's what Donald Trump did in reaction to that

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:22.481
that he's now going to possibly be paying for.

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:24.281
If I may quote Drake,

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:25.921
because I'm on your show, alright?

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.581
Am I. Do I have permission?

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.820
Please. Okay.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.420
Bury me now. And I only get bigger

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.960
every time that he tries to bury you.

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.641
Get it right. Every time you try to bury one of these stories,

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:40.681
whether it's Stormy Daniels,

00:00:40.682 --> 00:00:44.001
whether it's Karen Mcdougall or some reservoirs,

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.240
he's only made these women more powerful.
