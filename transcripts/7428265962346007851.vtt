00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.720
I also have a 3 year old. This is now my third 3 year old.

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:11.041
And god speed to anyone with a child aged 2 to 4,

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:12.681
because holy shit.

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:15.721
After my last round of raising toddlers nearly killed me,

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:17.001
I started reading a couple books

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:17.681
and I found out

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:20.061
that the reason why people talk so much shit on teenagers

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.620
is the same reason that they talk on toddlers.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.440
And it's actually for a very similar reason.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.881
They are going through a very similar brain developmental leap

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:30.161
around that age where they are testing boundaries,

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.241
they're pushing boundaries,

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:33.161
they are asserting their individuality.

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:35.601
I know we joke that we have three natures,

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.321
but it's actually very similar.

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:39.001
So although I don't have a teenager yet,

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.801
I have a ten year old, she's about to be 10.

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:43.181
So we're about to crest into this phase.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.640
I am certain that it's going to feel a lot like a more dangerous,

00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:50.201
more independent three major phase.

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:53.601
But I think if I hold on to the fact that it is a developmental leap,

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:57.261
a developmental brain stage very much like toddlerhood,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.880
I think I'll be able to emotionally handle it better.

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.181
At least. Here's hoping.
