00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.560
um Liz

00:00:00.561 --> 00:00:03.920
I'll start with you and your reaction to what we heard from Donald 

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:04.400
uh there

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:08.160
this claim that he will protect women whether they like it or not

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:11.140
and I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.160
might be the most truthful thing that Donald  has ever said

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:18.040
Donald has created a new cast system in America

00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:21.040
where pregnant women have become the untouchables

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:22.360
and this is not my opinion

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:24.720
these are the words of an expert in the field

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.560
Sarah Rosenbaum who's talked to Pro Publica for their stories

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.480
that you shared in the previous segment

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:30.560
who is saying that er

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:34.400
doctors are refusing to touch these pregnant women

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:37.760
and so what we have is not just a handful of women

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:41.100
what we have is thousands of women not being treated in

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.000
you know going through one of the most dangerous things that you can go through

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:45.600
as a woman which is childbirth right

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:47.800
childbirth is actually far more uh

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:50.240
safe than getting an aborshhhh

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:52.440
and we're not talking again about a few

00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:56.320
just in Texas alone where two women have died of these abortion bans

00:00:56.321 --> 00:01:01.000
we know that the amount of pregnant women who are dying in childbirth

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.720
has increased by 56%

00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:08.360
and so these politicians are creating a new hierarchy where they're at the top

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:09.880
and the women who birth them

00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:13.620
and the women who will birth the next generation of Americans are at the bottom
