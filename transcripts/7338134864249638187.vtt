I've been using these little headphone things

00:03.040 --> 00:04.040
for about a month now.

00:04.040 --> 00:05.960
I wanted to try them out for a long time

00:05.960 --> 00:07.580
before I gave a review.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.220
And, you guys,

00:09.520 --> 00:10.200
you need one of these.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.440
These are so cheap.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.440
They work so well.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.600
The battery lasts such a long time on them.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.520
I just love using them as a backup for when my, you know,

00:18.520 --> 00:20.600
more expensive ones die.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.040
I just pull out these and,

00:22.040 --> 00:23.160
um, use them.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.360
I also use them for when I'm, like,

00:24.360 --> 00:25.200
cleaning the house

00:25.200 --> 00:26.380
and I wanna just put,

00:26.680 --> 00:28.800
you know, one in my ear and listen to, like,

00:28.800 --> 00:30.900
a podcast or something. Um,

00:30.960 --> 00:32.200
they're just awesome ever.

00:32.200 --> 00:32.920
I'm telling you,

00:32.920 --> 00:33.800
go get these for, like,

00:33.800 --> 00:35.060
your friends or whoever.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.200
They're so little.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.193
They're so cute and perfect to just have around.
