00:00.080 --> 00:02.160
Here's everything my husband eats in a day,

00:02.161 --> 00:03.761
slash what I cook for him.

00:03.762 --> 00:05.121
Cooking is my love language,

00:05.122 --> 00:07.401
so this is not something that's expected of me.

00:07.402 --> 00:09.601
This is just something that I love doing.

00:09.602 --> 00:12.361
So I started off by making some buttermilk syrup

00:12.362 --> 00:14.481
for my French toast I'm about to make.

00:14.482 --> 00:17.441
Then I cracked some eggs, combined that with some heavy cream,

00:17.442 --> 00:18.601
nutmeg, cinnamon,

00:18.602 --> 00:22.421
and a splash of vanilla before mixing that until it's combined.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.840
I went on to slicing some brioche bread,

00:24.841 --> 00:28.441
some strawberries, and then moving on to making my heavy cream.

00:28.442 --> 00:32.041
I combined heavy cream with some powdered sugar and vanilla

00:32.042 --> 00:34.681
before beating that until it was fluffy.

00:34.682 --> 00:36.721
Dip my brioche bread, fried it up,

00:36.722 --> 00:38.641
and then topped it with my syrup,

00:38.642 --> 00:40.501
the heavy cream, and the strawberries.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.000
Lucky specifically requested this breakfast,

00:43.001 --> 00:45.761
and he ended up having three more plates after this.

00:45.762 --> 00:47.401
I always need a midday beverage.

00:47.402 --> 00:50.601
Today it was a watermelon cucumber sparkling mocktail.

00:50.602 --> 00:52.761
For lunch, I was making some tacos,

00:52.762 --> 00:55.621
so I started out by making my corn tortillas.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.800
Once those were all cooked,

00:56.801 --> 00:58.561
I set them aside in a towel

00:58.562 --> 01:01.581
before moving on to charring some lemon and lime.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.480
Lucky has been asking me to make some sort of chimichurri,

01:04.481 --> 01:06.761
so I made a charred lemon chimichurri,

01:06.762 --> 01:09.041
but also added some cilantro to it.

01:09.042 --> 01:10.681
I chopped all of my ingredients,

01:10.682 --> 01:12.521
topped with more of the lemon,

01:12.522 --> 01:16.121
seasoned it, and then set it aside while I marinated my chicken.

01:16.122 --> 01:19.221
This was A chipotle pepper and maple chicken.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.520
It was perfectly smoky, spicy,

01:21.521 --> 01:23.641
but also a slight bit sweet.

01:23.642 --> 01:26.241
And I topped my tacos with some of that chimichurri,

01:26.242 --> 01:28.401
some lime, and some extra chilies.

01:28.402 --> 01:30.921
Now, he gave these a 9.7 out of 10,

01:30.922 --> 01:32.741
which is a very high rating.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.700
Comes to him. He liked them so much that he had about 16 more.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.760
This turned out to be a very late dinner,

01:38.761 --> 01:42.721
but I wanted it to be simple and just whatever we had in the fridge.

01:42.722 --> 01:44.961
So I decided to make some duck fat,

01:44.962 --> 01:47.281
roasted potatoes, red wine gravy,

01:47.282 --> 01:50.481
and then Lucky's favorite vegetable lately has been broccoli knees,

01:50.482 --> 01:52.881
so I made a lemon garlic broccoli knee.

01:52.882 --> 01:55.721
I also bought these German sausages a couple days ago,

01:55.722 --> 01:58.801
so I thought they'd be. And then it was time to plate.

01:58.802 --> 02:00.841
This meal always hits the spot,

02:00.842 --> 02:02.441
and it's so, so good.

02:02.442 --> 02:04.801
After dinner, lucky wanted something sweet,

02:04.802 --> 02:09.061
so he had some of these lemon basil popsicles I made earlier today.
