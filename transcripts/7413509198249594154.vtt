After a crazy work week in New York,

00:02.161 --> 00:04.601
we finally made it to Utah for a few days

00:04.602 --> 00:06.681
to hang out with some family and friends,

00:06.682 --> 00:10.321
and we obviously had to stop by Hannah's house for some brunch.

00:10.322 --> 00:14.281
We had a whole spread going on with some croissants, crepes, fruits,

00:14.282 --> 00:16.221
homemade Nutella, and jams.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.840
Daniel also made us some yogurt the night before,

00:18.841 --> 00:20.561
which I couldn't get enough of.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.441
Kids could not contain their excitement

00:22.442 --> 00:26.101
and started running around the property while we had some brunch.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.660
Then it was time to head over to see the dairy.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.520
Getting 11 kids ready and out of the house took a second,

00:31.521 --> 00:34.041
but we finally made it onto our little walk,

00:34.042 --> 00:36.961
and the kids bonded over finding some tiny snakes

00:36.962 --> 00:39.041
before we made it over to the dairy barn.

00:39.042 --> 00:42.361
Seeing all the cows and the animals made me want a cow,

00:42.362 --> 00:44.961
even though I don't think I could ever manage that.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.681
The kids were so fascinated,

00:46.682 --> 00:49.981
and when we got back to the house wanted some milk immediately.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.240
Alex also made us some homemade ice cream,

00:52.241 --> 00:56.201
which was delicious. It was nice for all of us to sit down and catch up

00:56.202 --> 00:58.641
and talk about everything that's been going on.

00:58.642 --> 01:01.681
Rumble and slim needed to see how a cow was milked,

01:01.682 --> 01:05.401
so I gave it a try, and it's a lot harder than Hannah makes it look.

01:05.402 --> 01:06.961
We were all so sad to leave,

01:06.962 --> 01:09.381
but we know we're gonna be back very soon.
