00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.840
Let's make homemade yogurt together.

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.921
So I like to use raw milk,

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:07.101
but you can also use pasteurized.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.320
I'm heating a half a gallon of milk up to 188 degrees.

00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:15.061
Then I pour it off and let it cool to 115.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.320
Then I'm gonna whisk in two

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:19.781
tablespoons of yogurt I saved from the last batch,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.880
getting it all incorporated,

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:23.981
and then I just cover it with Saran wrap,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.640
and I put it in my warmer,

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.421
which is just a cabinet with a thermostat and heat lamp.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.560
This is at 115 degrees all night long,

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:34.441
12 to 24 hours, until the next morning when it's done.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.081
My yogurt turns out really wet.

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:37.361
There's a lot of extra way

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:41.041
so you can drain that off by straining it with cheesecloth,

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:42.401
but I just leave it wet,

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:46.021
and I stir in oats for my husband's breakfast muesli.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.140
Thanks for joining me. Enjoy.
