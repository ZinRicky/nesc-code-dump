00:00.040 --> 00:02.520
I crave pasta multiple times a week,

00:02.521 --> 00:04.401
and since I couldn't make it at home,

00:04.402 --> 00:07.281
the next best place to get it is Milan, Italy.

00:07.282 --> 00:10.001
So today we went to this cute Italian restaurant,

00:10.002 --> 00:13.841
and my eyes immediately zeroed in on the pizza and pasta.

00:13.842 --> 00:16.241
So I knew exactly what pasta I wanted to order,

00:16.242 --> 00:18.481
but I let the boys figure out the rest.

00:18.482 --> 00:20.881
I brought out some bread, which was kind of stale,

00:20.882 --> 00:22.521
so I didn't have a lot of it.

00:22.522 --> 00:25.041
Got a salad. We got two different pastas.

00:25.042 --> 00:26.321
One of them was carbonara.

00:26.322 --> 00:28.361
The other one was this papa del.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.201
We got Diavolo pizza,

00:30.202 --> 00:33.341
and I just started digging in since I was starving.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.840
Carbonara was so good. It was just too creamy for me.

00:36.841 --> 00:39.881
This mushroom parmigiana was so good,

00:39.882 --> 00:43.681
and I kept having it. Everything just needed a little bit of salt.

00:43.682 --> 00:46.321
The pizza was absolutely perfect.

00:46.322 --> 00:49.081
The boys loved that the most alongside the steak.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.601
Lucky didn't like the carbonara,

00:50.602 --> 00:52.961
so I had his. He was still hungry,

00:52.962 --> 00:55.041
so he got himself another pizza,

00:55.042 --> 00:57.701
and I wanted another portion of the parpedal.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.560
Lucky loves the combination of balsamic and pizza,

01:00.561 --> 01:03.041
which I'm not too sure about this point.

01:03.042 --> 01:05.761
I was done. Lucky finished off my pasta.

01:05.762 --> 01:08.081
I was stuffed, but needed something sweet,

01:08.082 --> 01:10.404
so I had some gelato, and we headed home.
