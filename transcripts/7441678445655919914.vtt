00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.640
So my son went to work with me today,

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:04.541
and he decided that he wanted to do some Christmas shopping

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.080
for his brothers and sisters.

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:06.681
So

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:09.321
he had a little bit of spending money for working with me for the day.

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:10.601
He did actually work really hard,

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:13.001
and he's. He's a part of the age where I can teach him how to work.

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:14.401
So this is perfect.

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:17.961
I was already inspired by the videos of Christmas shopping

00:00:17.962 --> 00:00:20.861
and thrifting instead of going to target and buying all brand new toys

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.980
or wherever you shop for Christmas presents.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.600
And normally I kind of avoid the toy section at goodwill

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:27.721
because the kids just wanna overload my house with toys.

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:29.441
And we are very minimal toy house.

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:31.401
We don't have toys out. We have, like,

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:33.601
Legos and then a few personal toys,

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:36.001
and that is it. If the kids can't pick it up in, like,

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.681
five minutes after asking to clean their rooms,

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:39.881
then it doesn't stay. But it's Christmas,

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:41.681
and my son wants to get into the.

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:42.561
The spirit of giving.

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:46.121
So we're gonna get some Christmas toys from the thrift store.

00:00:46.122 --> 00:00:48.201
And I don't know how long these are gonna last in the house,

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:49.861
but it's gonna be great on Christmas Day.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.280
The kids are gonna have fun and enjoy these toys.

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:54.761
And I will say this was extremely cheap.

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:59.781
We got enough toys for all the kids for $50
