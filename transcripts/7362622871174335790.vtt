00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.520
you don't have to be plus size to experience fatphobia

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:05.741
and I think that that concept is one of the reasons why people

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.840
gravitate towards the term

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:07.681
mid size so often

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:09.121
even if they're not actually mid size

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:09.961
I just made a video like

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:11.561
going into detail about the term mid size

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:12.041
but basically

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.881
the only people that actually should be calling themselves mid size (if they want)

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:15.481
are people in that

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.161
like in between between straight sizes and plus sizes

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:19.561
Iâ€™ll come online and I'll see someone who's like

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:22.001
literally a size medium call themselves mid size

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.440
that's not what that word means

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:26.641
you could still be curvy and straight size

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:28.081
I'm gonna use my girl Nicola as an example

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:29.761
first of all I love this woman so much

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:30.761
I do not play about her

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:32.281
and I think she's a perfect example of it

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:36.081
because she often gets called plus size because she is curvy

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:37.881
and specifically has had a rounder face

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:39.721
but she's like a very small human being

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:40.521
she's very petite

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:41.961
so despite her being curvy

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:43.881
I don't think that she would actually fall into

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:45.641
the category of plus size clothing

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:46.961
again someone can correct me if I'm wrong

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:48.081
but I'm like pretty sure I'm not

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:50.161
and so I think people that have this experience where they are not

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:52.561
like Societal's idea of what like

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:54.201
being skinny and thin is

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:56.961
but they are not like fat like me fat

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:58.081
like plus size fat

00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:00.741
so they gravitate towards this term mid size

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.280
and I understand again why people use it

00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.301
and because she exists in a curvy body

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.200
she does experience fatphobia

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:07.561
but she's still straight sized

00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:08.501
does that make sense

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.040
to clarify just because she's not technically plus size

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.681
doesn't mean you can't see her as representation

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:15.481
because like despite us being very vastly different sizes

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:19.561
I still do really love her and appreciate seeing her on my screen

00:01:19.562 --> 00:01:20.981
and feel represented by her

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.360
because like film and TV is so specific about the bodies that they do show us

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:26.881
and uplift on screen

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:30.401
that anybody outside of that norm is beautiful representation

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:31.321
in my opinion anyways

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:32.801
again I'm using her as an example

00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:34.841
this is not like an invitation to like

00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:36.601
say anything negative about her or her body

00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:38.121
I love that woman with my whole heart

00:01:38.122 --> 00:01:39.881
yeah I just wanna show you as an example that like

00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:41.161
you don't have to be plus size

00:01:41.162 --> 00:01:42.081
or even mid size

00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:45.801
to experience fatphobia and be impacted by fatphobic beauty standards

00:01:45.802 --> 00:01:48.223
like you could still be straight size and experience all of that
