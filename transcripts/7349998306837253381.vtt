00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
You're staying, you're staying,

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:02.741
you're gone. Sorry,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.160
wasn't sure about you. Um,

00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:05.801
but I'm gonna tip towards gone.

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:08.861
So gone, one of you two has been rejected.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.940
Who do you think it is?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.334
Wrong? It's you.
