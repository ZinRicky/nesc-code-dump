I understand that there's a lot of things that I can do that a lot of these people can't and there's a lot of things they can do that I can't and none of that is because I'm a man or there are women anything that I'm capable of doing all of these ladies behind me can do I've I've seen most of them do it and I believe that should extend far beyond where we're currently at anything I'm legally allowed to do they should be legally allowed to do too that's just, I mean, makes sense!
