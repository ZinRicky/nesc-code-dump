Advice is just criticism in a cashmere sweater moments where you shouldn't criticize “advise” your friends, family members, partner A. when they're not asking for it and B. when your advice isn't helpful I'll tell you in moments it's not helpful when you give advice to your partner and say that's not how you do the dishes that's not how you fold laundry that's not how you sweep whatever it may be or you're telling your friends that's not how you wear your makeup That’s not how you should wear that outfit or your family members, always judging their actions you may think that you're being the most helpful person and that you might give the best advice while that may be true oftentimes people are not asking for your advice or criticism and if you're always criticizing “advising” then they're not gonna like you anymore never forget that advice is just criticism in a cashmere sweater you wanna be an enjoyable person Stop advising so much when they're not asking for it! bye
