Everyone loves French toast in my house, so when my toddlers requested it this morning, I decided to just make it for them. I started off by making my brioche bread by adding some yeast flour milk to my bowl and letting that activate. Then I added in all of my eggs, some more flour, and needed that dough until it all came together. Once it started coming together and forming a dough, I cut up some butter and slowly drop that in until it was all incorporated. Then I covered that and let that rise until it was doubled in size before portioning it off in three portions. I rolled those out until they were about 9 inches long, pinch the top together, and then braided it up and tuck the bottom under so it would create a seal. I placed my dough into my loaf pan and let that rise until it was about doubled in size. In the meantime, I kept my mixed Berry compote by combining some frozen berries with some maple syrup and lemon juice and letting that reduce on the stove. Once that came together, I transferred it over and let that cool in my bowl. I brushed my brioche with some egg wash and pop that in the oven for about 35 minutes before pulling it out. I let that cool while I made a quick whipped cream is. Who doesn't love French toast with whipped cream on top? At this point, my Bread was cool enough to slice, so I cut it into slices, making sure that they weren't too thin before I combined my egg with some heavy whipping cream, vanilla and cinnamon to dip my bread in. I coated both sides and then placed my bread in a buttered up pan. I fried it until it was golden brown and and it was time to plate. I put my French toast down, topped it with the mixed Berry compote, whipped cream, and I also had some passion fruit lying around and the kids love it, so I put that on top and they absolutely loved it.
