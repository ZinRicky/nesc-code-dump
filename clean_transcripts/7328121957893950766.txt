hello good morning um I got really busy yesterday so I wasn't able to finish our conversation on Ballerina Farm but this is part two so once again this is not specifically about the account Ballerina Farm but I think it's really good like case study for what I wanna talk about and that's social media regulation and literacy media literacy people often forget that Ballerina Farm is not her personal vlog it is a business account every single one of her videos is a curated marketing advertisement to sell you a feeling a lifestyle and a brand very much in the way that like the Marlborough company for years had like the cowboy aesthetic the last time I came on here I talked about the Nefari's nature of trad wives and honestly Ballerina Farms wasn't even in my radar as top five of the most like malicious and nefarious accounts to be worried about because the Trap Wife content that I'm concerned about isn't homesteading account necessarily at all or homemaking accounts accounts that do homemaking and homesteading but then also talk about this is why women are miserables because they were went they went to the workplace and that the woman's place is in the home marriages are failing because women just aren't submitting to their men that is also marketing and advertisement but it's marketing and advertisement for in ideology and although ballerina farms may have those conservative Christian values their core purpose of their account is not to sell that ideology it is simply to sell their products but because social media is so new people are taking her videos at face value unable to see the production that goes on behind it and blurring the lines between the fact that Hannah is a person Ballerina Farms is a brand and putting her on a pedestal of like this is what like the good life looks like this is back to nature don't get me wrong if I had $10 billion I would look just like her but it's a little irresponsible in my opinion for there to be no disclosure about the fact that this is advertisement because real homesteaders real farmers don't live the curated life that she's portraying online and the stakes are also way higher for those people than a wealthy hobby farmer and I call them hobby farmers because the stakes of their farm if they fail they will still be able to eat they will not go homeless
