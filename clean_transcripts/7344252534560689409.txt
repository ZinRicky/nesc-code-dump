I posted a vlog the other day sharing a particularly busy day in the life of the mother of three and when I say particularly busy that day was out the fkn gate and if that day was a crazy day then this day is gonna be the polar opposite so because I don't really feel like leaving the house or doing anything unless I absolutely have to so come spend a regular day in the life with me my husband got up early and took the dog for a run before heading off into work and so I just had to deal with everything else I gave the kids their breakfast made their lunch packed their bags got them ready for school and dropped them off before coming home and dealing with some admin I caught up in my emails took a zoom meeting ordered my groceries and edited some content before ripping into the household chores which I was really hoping might do themselves and the whole time I was making the beds I was struggling with the urge just to hop back in because I don't know what's going on with Goldie at the moment but she seems to be having a sleep regression Goldie is my two and a half year old vizsla and lately she's been waking up five or six times a night and sometimes she'll just come and stare at me and I don't know why anyway I'm extremely tired and it reminds me of that feeling that you get when you have a Newborn which is why I am not gonna be having anymore Newborns I opened a PR pack from Lorna Jane before deciding to have a shower and my shower turned into an everything shower which even normally happens during the day but I have a photoshoot tomorrow with BraveFace so I justified it to myself by telling myself it was work and my husband's not getting home till late and by the time i get through the afternoon with the kids I figured I'm not gonna wanna do any of this shit so I might as well just do it I raced out and pick the kids up from school before dealing with the groceries dealing with the kitchen and then dealing with the bathroom and this is one of my non negotiable daily clean areas I mean obviously the kitchen gets cleaned multiple times a day but the bathroom will get a surface clean once a day and a deep clean once a week and then please be assured I thoroughly washed my hands before starting on the dinner and then this is one of my lazy girl go to dinners which I know the kids will eat every single time and that I make when I really can't be fkd making a proper dinner and it's gonna look like a proper dinner and taste like a proper dinner but I swear to god it takes like 10 minutes to make I've got a variation of this saved under my Easy Recipes playlist so basically it's just onions mushrooms chicken herbs salt and pepper lemon juice capers a bit of mustard chicken stock and cream and I just pop it in the oven for like an hour and a half stirring occasionally and it basically cooks itself and I must have been feeling particularly maternal today because my kids just absolutely adore these cookies so I decided to whip up a quick batch so that they could have a hot cookie for pudding let me know if you want the recipe for this by the way because I could make these with my eyes closed and again it's an easy recipe that takes extra no time and you will find if you follow me that this is a consistent theme with a sort of food that I cook it's gotta be quick it's gotta be easy and it's gonna be delicious cause we don't have the time capacity or patience to fk around and be fancy over here I finished the dinner off with a bag of spinach which disappeared into another dimension added my cooked pasta some Parmesan and some fresh chopped basil then I dished the kids up with a side of green beans cause I figured I'd eat later when my husband got home and for their treat of course they got a hot cookie and no hot cookie is complete without a cup of milk I got the babies clean read them their stories put them to sleep then I sat down and did some prep for tomorrow ate a cookie and ignored my washing
