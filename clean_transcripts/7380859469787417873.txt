is it aesthetic? but is it authentic? also no but is it fkn delicious comfort food with seven hidden vegetables that serves six For less than $5 each? yes, yes it is and at risk of really pissing off the Italian community this is how I make my lasagna nobody ever actually taught me how to make lasagna so this could be all wrong this is just one of those recipes that I figured out when I first became a mum in a pan pop onion and garlic saute until soft and translucent into that I'm adding mushroom courgette carrot and capsicum then I add a kilo of my beef mince and season generously with kelp salt mixed herbs smoked paprika cumin and pepper then I add some of this yeast spread which is totally optional but I do find it gives the heartier flavour I also add Worcestershire sauce balsamic vinegar and a can of tomatoes you wanna let that simmer and reduce for as long as you possibly can basically or for as long as you've got time for then I get started on my cheese sauce so I begin with a roux made of butter flour and milk I'm actually using oat milk cause we didn't have any cow's milk which is why the milk's not super white but either way it still tastes the same to me and in goes the cheese and when you've got your cheese sauce to the right consistency it's time to put your lasagna together using fresh lasagna sheets so these are already oven ready I just start layering my mince my cheese sauce and my pasta and I do this as many times as I can with the ingredients that I have and when I'm on to my final layer I top it all with some grated mozzarella cheese cover with tin foil so we don't burn that top layer of cheese and pop it in the oven when it's about halfway done I do take that tin foil off so the top can become nice and golden let it stand for a couple of minutes before slicing and serve it this is such an easy family friendly dish and a guaranteed crowd pleaser as always you can find the recipe down below
