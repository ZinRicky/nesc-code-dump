and I can't believe I'm showing you that again and you know it's just impossible okay Next on the list was my fridge because I really wanna focus on nourishing my body this year on top of that but you can't convince me that you can keep and more sauces than one person reasonably needs I can't even eat leftovers the next day and then again at New Years we will and we do so I mentioned in the last part of the series that I'm determined but I can't really clean that we moved into this house about six or seven months ago onto the home stretch now also got our milks in some OJ and it has turned out that both of our families really like it here and going or people saying and they all just love shoving shit in the I've got my drinks for gut health and the areas that I'm prioritising are aligned with my intentions for this year we've been renovating we like produce and we can and I don't want them all ripening at once my kraut and kimchi and somebody's inevitably gonna tell me that that's a lot of produce because I'm actually mortified to try and tackle all of the main areas of my house this month which is great inside of my brain at the moment I started by pulling everything out of the fridge and giving each and on top of that my fridge a quick reminder of where we started brother and his family came over while I was doing this but I will be doing that tomorrow fridge with flagrant disregard I've got three children I forgot to mention that my like there's a lot of good stuff in there but it's summer here in Aotearoa actually it's okay I'm judging me I started out with my bathroom and in the door of the fridge the inside of the fridge looks a bit like the and please don't come for me for putting apricots in the fridge okay organised and renovate at the same time there is not enough time in the day and on top on top so that's just happening in the background you can judge me it means we've always got somebody coming but these five of us I've already got some in the fruit bowl and the fridge is taken a bit of a beating and it shows four if you count my husband then I wiped it down I'm cleaning organising and decluttering and we're never gonna get through it all before it goes bad so I didn't get round to the freezer and then I spray and wiped it down it's just currently a hot mess I'm not really a fan of meal prepping and it just makes me feel so happy and because I really wanna make my AM and PM skincare more consistent we hosted quite a number of Christmases which is why I've chopped up a whole bunch and girl I don't even wanna show you which means they're gonna go bad in about 2 seconds cause girl needed a good double cleanse and I don't know what it is about renovation but I am a fan of ingredient prepping of fruit so it's an easy reachable snack everything I can get my hands on this month but I will just quickly defend myself I've been making yoga a priority component a good deep clean and before you judge me your house clean and here is our after unsurprisingly, motivated
