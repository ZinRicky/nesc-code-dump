check out this cleaning box that Scrub Daddy sent me from TikTok this thing is bursting with scrub daddies and I was super excited to bust them out like their colour collection so I can colour code which area the house the Scrub Daddy stay in so like I'll keep the blue ones in the bathroom and this is their version of like the Magic Eraser and I wanna try on this bathtub today we moved into our house about six months ago we've been travelling so much we haven't got deep in this bathroom since we moved in we don't use the very often as the guest bathroom but it's time to really strip down this nasty Cork and get the limescale stains off of this tub I started out with all the different types of scrub daddies and then I finished off with the Magic Eraser which is probably my favourite one so far it has a regular scrub daddy texture on one side and then a Magic Eraser on the other and that really did make a big difference and standing in the tub and I would love to give you an after shot but I forgot the Cork gun so I couldn't finish so I continue to scrub the tub you guys gonna watch me install the scrub buddy sink holder I love my scrub mommy for doing dishes and this is the perfect little holder for her
