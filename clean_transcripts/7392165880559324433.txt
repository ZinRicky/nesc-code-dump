okay this is what I would officially like to call late stage feminism I've just coined this term and I'm calling it this video signifies late stage feminism Doctor Zoe and I have a PhD in feminism and I wanna explain why so Rosie the Riverdale appeared in World War 2 and she was on posters the most common version um is kind of her in a red scarf holding her fist up and saying we can do she was symbolizing women who working in the shipyards women who working in construction and doing what were traditionally male dominated jobs that was because of course so many of the men were away working the war so women had to take up those efforts so over time she's become known as a symbol of feminism um as a symbol that women can do um men's jobs women are capable of achieving anything that they want and so she has become like it's become quite an important piece of feminist iconography um and her legacy has lasted so when you've got this feminist iconography even if it's very basic very mainstream feminist iconography and you've slapped that on overly hyper sexualized hyper objectified woman who is squeezing her boobs holding a little power tool doing sexy things wearing construction wear with a thong you've got a problem because you're conflating hypersexualization with female empowerment and this you cannot tell me this is not designed for a male gaze this is not the same as Chapelron getting up on stage in the statue of Liberty wearing a thong because that is coming from her own self expression you can tell we can tell the difference between authentic and designed by men in a boardroom she has an artistic vision that she is carrying out and also it's queer it doesn't have to be queer for it to still be authentic but it's very different and you can see it Doctor Luke is clearly gone there's a feminine phenomenon and we gotta get on board with it how can we leverage it and we know when a lot of people have commented on just how literally problematic it is that Doctor Luke who is a known predator and um perpetrator in the industry is actually the one producing this it's almost feels like they've teamed up to make fun of the feminist and feminine renaissance in pop you cannot simply slap a bunch of AI generated basic feminist lyrics on and a Rosie the Riverdale red scarf on Katy Perry and call it feminism not when it's clearly written by a man like she's a daughter she's a mother or whatever the lyrics are that is what men always say when they're trying to say that they're feminists you rarely hear women say it unless they're super right wing you cannot tell me that those lyrics were written by a woman like when you're writing a feminist empowerment song you're not like saying like oh women are mothers and women are women are wives and women are daughters like that's why they're important like women wouldn't say that women already know that they're important whether or not they're those things because those things are relational concepts usually in relation to the men in their lives so you're still defining a woman's worth and value based on her value to men true feminists don't do that and you wouldn't say she's soft she's strong it's gross highlighting the individual womanly assets of a woman is self objectification or objectification is not empowerment feminism so that brings me to why this signifies to me that this is late stage feminism late stage feminism is when feminist concepts and symbols and ideas are adopted by the mainstream superficially in order to profit from them the fact that this was marketed as a feminist anthem tells me that you know the very top echelons of the music industry have decided that feminism is the best way to get to the mainstream because feminism is mainstream now and they're probably seen the sort of revolution in pop music and gone we've got to get on top of it we've got to get on the bandwagon but it reeks it absolutely stinks everyone can tell it's inauthentic it doesn't come from a real place of purpose it actually mocks the movement it confuses objectification empowerment to the point of like conflating it to the point where it feels like you've either gotta be really really out of touch or you're deliberately trying to upset people just to create controversy just to get views it's like men are saying that's Jessica Simpson these boots are made for walking slap a red scarf on it and we're good to go it screens 20 tens but make make it feminist and the video especially reinforces the very power structures that it claims to be challenging
