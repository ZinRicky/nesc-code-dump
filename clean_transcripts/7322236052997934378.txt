I would never take issue with the choices a woman especially mother has to make in order to benefit herself and her family what I do take issue with is the patriarchy that set up a binary of choice that makes having a good choice an option for a mother almost impossible when we operate within a system we have to navigate the boundaries of that system the best we can stay at home mom working mom work from home mom child free it truly doesn't matter because the system we all navigate these decisions and life choices under is not meant to be easy or benefit women it is made to be easy and benefit men so do what you gotta do girly because the options were given are given to us by a system that doesn't like us very much and it's very obvious
