we're renovating our 68 year old family home on a budget and I'm excited because today is the day our kitchen finally gets her glow up but I'm also oblivious to the minor shit storm that may or may not be brewing and I'm gonna cut a long story short here but this kitchen is actually not that old it's got great bones I'm just personally not vibing the black and grey aesthetic the kitchen is also on the shady side of the house and I don't mean the side that my husband lives in I mean the side that doesn't get a whole lot of natural light so it's on the same side as the lounge if you caught any of that room renovation anyway point being the light that it does get is being absorbed by these dark finishes making it feel a whole lot darker than it needs to be so initially I started toying with the idea of maybe painting the tiles maybe painting the bench and giving the space a bit of an aesthetic refresh but also I give my kitchens a really hard life I've got three children and I'm in this space all the time so I didn't wanna have to turn around and redo it in two years do you know what I mean so one day like 10 months ago now I went to go browse stone at Cosentino and it turns out you can't window shop for benchtops without absolutely falling in love and then I found a sink and a tap and some tiles that I love and anyway - almost a year of manifestation later - cut to: demolishing my kitchen our fabricators were Architectural Stone and they came and measured up and from there it was a waiting game waiting for our install day And they were kind enough to offer to help us remove our existing countertops and honestly I'm bloody grateful that they did because I don't have enough muscles for that job quick side story but we spent a few years renovating our first home and now we've been working on this house for a year and if I've learnt just one thing it said it's basically fkn impossible to do a room without a hiccup so naturally this room was no exception when it came time to install on the bench tops unfortunately there was a hiccup it's nobody's fault it just is what it is and what it is is dishes in the shower for the next 2 weeks but the end is in sight, so come back for the update
