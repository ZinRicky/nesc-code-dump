this year I've decided I'm gonna spend 45 minutes a day reading a nonfiction and developing a new skill it's a way for me to control what I can control when things they feel out of control and these are the topics that I'm interested these are books that I recommend uh one is a 2B read so I'm excited to read it but here we go we're gonna be dismantling the patriarchy the world of change and bell hooks is incredible this is a fabulous book to start talking about patriarchy dismantling patriarchy and how patriarchy hurts men hood feminism this is on my to be read this has been recommended to me a million times I have not gotten around to reading it yet but it is going to be a intersectional look at the feminism movement and I actually follow the author on here and think she is brilliant so this is on my to be read the Whole Brain Child this is a great read especially if you're early on in your gentle parenting journey because it helps you understand the why why your kids are acting the way they are and strategies to parent them incredible adult children of emotionally immature parents I have read this it makes you cry so be careful um how did it heal from distant rejecting or self involved parents I think a lot of us millennials could use this book hmm you can pick a completely different topic to deep dive into you can pick uh animal husbandry or carpentry or science or midwifery maybe important um any sort of non fiction to either stimulate your mind improve in places that you don't know that much in and just you know find out more because all the knowledge is there for you you don't have to read all these books you can pick one book and they're generally short so like this isn't gonna take you that long so I challenge you to 45 minutes a day it can even be thirty
