Iâ€™m gonna let you guys in on a little secret.. advice is just criticism and a cashmere sweater here's why you shouldn't always be so quick to give your advice freely Advice can be helpful But it can also be hurtful in moments where people aren't asking for it You might give the best advice out there but if your friend doesn't want it or your partner doesn't want it save your input and just be there for them be an enjoyable person
