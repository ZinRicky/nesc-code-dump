I have found the best hair tool for super fine hair it's this ionic hair waver by Novis it creates a super fun beachy wave style which fits our Florida lifestyle so perfectly Novis Ionic Hair Waver has 14 temperature settings heats up in 30 seconds and will automatically turn off after one hour if you forget to unplug it and let's be honest we all forget it was really easy to and because of the temperature controls I wasn't worried about frying my daughter's hair she has really fine hair that does not hold curls we have tried everything under the sun and this is the first hair tool that has actually worked for her just look at how beautiful she is
