let me show you my daughter's really cool Stanley that I got her she's disabled and she brought it to school and then for the one fucking period that she didn't have her para with her somebody took it I wonder who took it one of the neurotypical kids when your kid comes home with a fucking Stanley Cup that you didn't buy them they probably stole it from one of the intellectually disabled kids in school like mine who got her fucking cup stolen good job any parent who allows their kid to come home with a very expensive item that they know they didn't buy them is a really fucking shitty parent and whatever parent allowed their kid to come home with my disabled daughters Stanley water cup that I literally cried when I found cause it wasn't the 40 ounce tumbler with the handle on the side it was the one that was like tall and like it had a straw that you could open and it had a handle like it was just so perfect for my disabled daughter I was like I don't even give a fuck that it's a Stanley Cup that's a great side note that my daughter is gonna get to like be a part of the in crowd with her cup but I was just amazed because the cup like met all of her needs as a disabled child the way she could hold it the way she could cover the straw it was just super perfect and some little shit stain stole it so if your kid came home with a brand new Stanley Cup that wasn't theirs great great job
