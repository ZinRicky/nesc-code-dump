one of the things I've been learning the last few years is that my worship and the way I praise the Lord doesn't have to just be on Sunday mornings I can glorify him and honour him by the working of my hands and I can worship him by doing laundry by cleaning by whatever chore I'm doing and I can meditate on his word and that can bless me and others around me part of that is also giving of our time and our money my husband and I have partnered with World Vision they're offering a new kind of subscription so that those in need can have access to clean water hygiene kits and other resources that are readily available for you and I but not for those in need help create a world where children and families can thrive
