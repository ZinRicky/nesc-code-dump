having money does not put you above anyone Not your friends, not your family not your loved ones if you grew up without money then you know exactly what it's like to struggle I grew up with a single mother working long hours just to make ends meet so I know what it's like to have no money so I would never put myself above anyone who has less because I know what it's like some of you are out running around Not knowing what it's like to struggle You’ve never had any real problems so you think you're better think you're better just because you have more If you act like that then you're below the people who have less than you you may be financially rich but you're morally poor we'd all like to think that we're humble but if you put yourself above others because you have more look in the mirror and ask yourself am I really humble If you don't know what it's like to struggle put yourself in somebody else's shoes for a second It’s really not that hard to understand never put yourself above anyone
