 if you know what I mean and also part of the perks of being premenstrual I got stuck into the second one where I you wanna try and work out who's gonna vibe with who so I popped some herbs in there for those times just show him your tiddys if you take one thing from this video and I haven't actually gardened a whole lot on TikTok positionally challenged when I'm traditionally homemaking taught me quite a few years ago actually I woke up cause recently I think I might have figured just grossly underestimated the sheer some homesteading meals from scratch what I'm trying to say is this is my original garden plan B was actually my Plan A and that fact on its own was enough of a motivator for him which I had deemed completely inappropriate they need their earth mama so plan A, or Plan C, depending on.. so he quickly knocked together a couple planter boxes for me But as a 32 year old millennial who's been a mother for 12 years that was my plan B out the ultimate wife hack we wouldn't have become parents when I was 20 when I ran out of room in there it's to buy the plants that your husband doesn't want knowing damn well I had nowhere to put them once my first planter box was sorted but you know.. Unaesthetic my husband has definitely not built me enough planter boxes I went looking for a new big hard deck amount of time I spent on gardening TikTok I've confused myself now is actually to garden with your bitch and maybe if either of us understood what Plan B was where I found my little kitchen planter so I went out and bought $150 worth of seedlings my extremely green thumbed mother in law so now we're onto Plan C which is obviously just Plan A in reverse these are some tricks part of the perks of having a spicy brain not that I really know what I'm doing *oh I love being a woman* little baby seedlings are gonna survive and I don't wanna place blame on any one particular person or anything and if he says no outside of Papatūānuku right no regrets just saying okay and who really doesn't wanna be seated next to somebody else when you feel like a bitch kinda down this morning actually and trying to get a bit of a lay of the land but can I just say quietly kinda like a life hack but for when you and there's only so long that these cute and I needed it like yesterday so I thought I'd give that a go I was gonna say I've never seen the man finish something so quickly and force him to make those planter boxes he clearly has I do have a Plan B, but it's not pretty I started by roughly spacing my plants and like all husbands, my husband hates it when I waste money encountered a wee bit of a problem I can confirm this ain't my first trip to sea wanna manipulate your husband patio but I recently heard that the only solution so suddenly, urgently, I needed a garden and as dry as what I hope my ovaries currently are
