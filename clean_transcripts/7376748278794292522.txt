You know when a craving hits and you can't stop thinking about it? Ever since I started using the new Lineage Watermelon Pop Lip Sleeping Mask, I've been thinking about having watermelon lavender sorbet. So today I just decided to finally make it. So I started by making a simple syrup by combining some water, sugar, and lavender. After letting that boil and steep, I transferred it over to a glass jar to cool off. In the meantime, I cut up my watermelon. Nothing screams summer more than having a good watermelon. So I cut it in half and then took the skin off before slicing it into little spears, transferred them over to my blender, and I did this in batches, blended it up, and then strained it through a strainer. At this point I added in my lavender simple syrup before giving that a good mix, adding some lemon juice and lemon zest, and I transferred it over to my ice cream Turner and let that go until it got a little bit more solid. I couldn't resist trying some, so I had two scoops and it was absolutely divine.
