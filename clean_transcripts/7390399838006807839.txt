how did I get here and by here I mean a homeschool mom before I can tell you we need to go back to where it all began a few years ago I was a classroom teacher and getting a master's degree in school administration and that is when I Learned that schools were not created for kids and I kind of Learned all of the ins and outs things that happen behind the scenes and I was not really a fan of it throughout my entire teaching career I had code teachers who are very pro homeschooling I was not I was very pro school but I had them in the back of my mind fast forward to 2020 2021 school year we all know what happened and now I'm getting ready to put my kindergartener into a school where they don't know what the next school year is going to look like they don't know what mandates and all of these things are going to look like for the next school year so I was already hesitant but my daughter was going to school we signed up for a kindergarten tour at the same school where I taught at the same school my husband had gone to elementary through high school this was our comfort zone and we knew that this was going to be the best fit for our daughter also at this time there was some like questionable moral stuff happening at schools we all know what I'm talking about but I just wasn't about to expose my daughter to all those things but it's a private Christian school we thought we weren't gonna deal with that except those are the exact conversations we heard from students while we were walking around on our tour throughout the whole tour I'm kind of feeling uneasy like I thought that this was 100% the option that we were going to choose but something just in my spirit wasn't sitting right and I didn't know like I thought I was the only one failing this because I didn't wanna let go of my baby I had been her mom and her teacher for five years now and like I felt like maybe it was just me wanting to give up control but then we got in the car and the first words out of my husband's mouth were I think you should homeschool I looked at this man like he was nuts I did not want to homeschool I was like let's tour some other schools first cause that's not on the table so we went home we prayed about it for and also just a few days and I had Amy Morgan in the back of my mind homeschool homeschool so here we are now I homeschool both my kids and it is the best thing that I have ever done
