iâ€™ve done a lot of things to finally get comfortable in my body and like the person that I am ironically one of the things that actually helps me when I'm feeling kinda bad about myself is thinking about people on Ed Twitter because they at one point or maybe still use me in my fat body as fat spo which is basically like inspiration to starve themselves so they don't look like me insane anyway don't go looking for this genuinely one of the worst parts of the internet anyway it was like a summer where I spent a lot of time looking at Ed Twitter accounts because I needed to block all of them and it made me so sad because no one was good enough for these even the smallest thinnest people I've literally ever seen there was some 15 year old on a private Twitter calling her fat like that was one of the final times that it clicked for me as long as I live there is genuinely nothing that I can do to make everyone like no if I'm not gonna win why would I even play the game because I know that there is no possible way for me to live up to that standard I don't adhere to it at all and there is something so freeing about knowing that you will never be good enough for them genuinely the only thing that you can do is think about how you feel about how you look figure out if you can be comfortable the way you are
