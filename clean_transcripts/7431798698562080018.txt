Here's my impression of Gen z's finding out how old I am. Hey, yeah, I'm 34. You're 34? Like 30 + 4. Yeah. My god, you do not look 34. I would have said like 24 max. Ha ha. No, but thank you. What's like your skincare routine? Like, do you drink lots of water? But you're on TikTok. That is just crazy.
