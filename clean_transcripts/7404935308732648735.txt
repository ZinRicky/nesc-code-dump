I have always wanted to like fly somewhere for the day, like fly and come home in the day. And I did that yesterday. I had this like event that I had to go to in Los Angeles. I had to do my own makeup. And I promise you these makeup brushes that I got from the TikTok shop. It's like a 48 piece kit. It comes with like all these brushes. And the reason why I love it is cause if I fuck up, I'm just like, fuck it. And then I get another brush. I don't have to worry about like figuring it out cause I always know what the fuck I'm doing. But it comes with these brushes, it comes with these like little cleaning cloths. It comes with this thing to clean your brushes, a bunch of makeup sponges, a bunch of these little things. Like I feel like a fucking professional, you know? The makeup application is to be decided, but the tools are top notch and they're linked right here.
