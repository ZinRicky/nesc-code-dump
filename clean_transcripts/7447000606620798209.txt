this is not a drill the pool is finally full and the sun is finally out so I can finally show you how the old girl turned out we spent six weeks restoring a 50 year old pool all by ourselves with no pool renovation experience and she's pretty big and was looking pretty feral so I won't lie I was deeply concerned at times there was so many steps leading up to this point but in the last part we had just finished painting and we were finally ready to turn on the tap which yes for those wondering is a hell of a lot cheaper than getting 60,000 litres of water delivered I don't know exactly how much cheaper yet but rest assured when I get that bill I will tell you and it took pretty much exactly two days to fill but I was expecting three and I was so fkn nervous to find out how it was gonna look final reminder of where we started and this is where we ended up what do you think? Bit of an improvement? and can I just quietly say I'm actually so proud of this we could have never undertaken this when we first moved in 18 months ago this was definitely our biggest and most physically demanding project date but it feels so nice and clean now it's no longer covered in mould and infested with algae it's no longer cracked with weird holes in the bottom and that was just phase 1 obviously it needs furniture styling landscaping and if you wanna see that unfold I'm so sorry but come back for the update
