now Winston Churchill was not a huge fan of the movement and he actually said so he was concerned that the movement has to say all they can really hear is like a bell ringing Mike drop it might not seem like much she's saying we're here like men had lifted these women up above their heads and they were drunk and these women were associating themselves with this rowdy kind of behaviour he could not get a word in imagine just dedicating 2 years of your life to following around a male cause she's just there she's just there with her bell ringing it is an assertion of her authority and independence and empowerment allying themselves with the forces of drink and reaction during Winston Churchill's 19 0 8 and 19 0 9 political campaigns but at the time all of this would have been very controversial political campaigner that you disagree with I've seen the some regret at the time so public houses are bars you need to make some noise but Mary was not having any of it and she was like that never happened a woman saying I would not have a man pick me up I would box his ears so Mister Churchill was running his by election at the time and she's famous for following Winston Churchill around with a bell we're women we want the vote it's a good reminder that sometimes in order to be heard well regarded kind of activities with her giant bell ringing it in his ear every single time he tried to speak I'm informed by the rowdy elements stop spreading lies if a man ever tried to lift me up who's stronger an Irish woman or Mister Churchill they were carried shoulder high this woman was a boss she was an innovator she came onto the scene in 19 o eight and joined the suffrage movement he was greeted with a large crowd of ladies shut up and listen how much clearer can I make it look that would do damage to the reputation and seriousness of the cause I can actually think of a lot of worse ways to spend my time every time the crowds like trying to listen to what this dude has which are always to be found at a public house made manifestation and ringing a bell every single time he tries to make a speech and I guess with everything going on in the world right now creating much din Mary Meloni then shook her fist at Winston Churchill and said it was a unique approach and I applaud her for that her saying I would box him around the ears and the next time he appeared in public to speak it basically means that Winston Churchill was concerned and as he went to address the audience most earnest advocates of the cause ringing it loudly every time he spoke I wasn't there and I don't know what happened he could not show up to a rally or a speech without this woman there now Mary Meloni was not having anyone saying any such thing about her movement who had the support of an even bigger crowd that the suffragettes were aligning themselves with less huge news this woman is refusing to be patronised she was ahead of her time he was saying that apparently okay what does that mean a carriage drew up close to his car with a bell clanging all the time so this is Mary Malony and she was one of the sassiest protesters in history Mary Malony was an Irish suffragette
