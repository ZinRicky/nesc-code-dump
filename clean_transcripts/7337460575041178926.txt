a man with hustle needs a woman with a vision, not a little girl who parties. This generation is filled with people excited for the weekend so they can party and let loose what a waste of a weekend How abut we look forward to the week? the daily routine, working your job, hitting the gym, making dinner, being in bed by eight PM. why don't we look forward to that? that's what I look forward to! not two days wasted spending money just to get a headache that'll last all week long men don't want that they like routine, they want routine, they want to be better without the stress or drama that partying usually leads to the same goes for women women need a man with a vision that'll help lead them to success both women and men need a partner with a vision not a child who likes to party
