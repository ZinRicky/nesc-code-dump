I was just asking for advice on my last video about wake windows oh my god you sweet sweet wonderful person you are a new mom I am a seasoned mom my oldest child is turning 10 this year so I wanna give some like big sisterly mom advice first of all you are an expert on your baby you may not be an expert on parenting but you will become an expert on your own child it takes time every Newborn is completely different and comes with a learning curve so people who tell you they know how you should handle your baby you can really just leave that information for them now about joining the world of motherhood online because nobody told me about this either moms are the meanest bitches on the fucking planet to each other it has nothing to do with you especially in this postpartum these early days of motherhood I would highly recommend not posting questions to the internet if you're looking for an answer to a question search up the question in like the search bar of a social media thing and you will find somebody who has made a video on this particular topic but comment sections in mom groups and or on like Mom TikTok Mom social media they can be brutal so if you're not in a strong enough place to tell people to fuck off don't get in there okay those are not the people that you should be talking to protect your peace in this season okay you're gonna need it through trial and error you will find what works for your child and if you need actual help there are sleep consultants and mom baby nurse experts that make a lot of great content that you can follow to kind of get up to speed about some of the things you may not have researched yet good luck hold your baby and don't listen to anybody else
