okay no offense to this creator cause there's tons like her but as somebody who's lived in Charleston for 13 years not a born and raised local but somebody who moved here before it had like blown up on the map people moving here to pursue a like Charleston influencer aesthetic are kind of ruining Charleston don't mean to say that everybody who moves here is doing that because a lot of people move here for a lot of different reasons and it's blown up since Covid but I will tell you that the people who come here with a preconceived idea of what Charleston is without also assimilating to like some of the cultural nuances here make it less fun to be here I moved here from New York I was one of the only people that had moved here all of my core friends were born and raised Charlestonians and as someone new to the area you had to learn how to assimilate you assimilated into the culture you talked to the grocery store checkout lady at the Piggly Wiggly walk a little slower you get used to the fact that we didn't have Doordash and Uber Eats and all of these things that you're used to in a big city there's a slowness and a charm about this city that was so magical and so enchanting I swear to god as soon as travel and leisure got a hold of it and started posting it as like the best small city in the United States so many people moved here without taking the breath to become part of Charleston they wanna video it they wanna get their outfit of the day they wanna go to every hot restaurant but they haven't really made friends with people who are locals here you see it with businesses too there's so many investor LED businesses that are moving to Charleston that is pushing out the mom and pop shops the chef owned restaurants driving up rentals for storefronts driving up housing costs creating a massive problem with traffic and infrastructure because we have built for just all of the new people coming into these high density living situations out any new roads or highways Carlton just doesn't feel the same as it did 13 years ago and my husband's been here like 25 years and it just doesn't feel the same this shouldn't be LA and don't get me wrong there's a lot of positives to money and tourism coming into the city absolutely because you used to not be able to have a freaking job here unless you worked F&B but as someone who is also a newcomer to Charleston but has lived here long enough to see the changes and somebody who moved here and became like extremely protective over the way of life here and over the way people treat each other here and just over the the sleepy quiet town vibe that Charleston used to have just kinda makes me sad Charleston does not cater to the locals anymore in price in what they're selling and how they're selling it and it's really unsustainable for the people who've made their life here
