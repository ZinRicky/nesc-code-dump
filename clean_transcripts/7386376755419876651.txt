so I realized something that made me kind of sad recently and if you're a mom you can probably relate um and that is that I have been remus in my duties to myself you see I talk a lot about self care and I talk a lot about finding your identity or having an identity outside of motherhood and I feel like in the past six months to a year I've been really bad about that and I'm starting to feel it it's starting to feel like a weight and I feel like I'm blaming it on having no time but it's also the prioritization of my time so now that I'm homeschooling you know my kids are around all the time it's much harder for me to take time for myself and that's one of the reasons that I've noticed things slipping is because now that they can see everything I do in a day I feel almost guilty if I'm doing something that isn't like family house or child focused you know I haven't been going to the gym as regularly I haven't been cooking dinner really because we're schlepping to bunch of different activities so I've been compensating by doing Hellofresh and doing takeout and but I love to cook I love to cook it was my dream it was my job before having kids and I'm not cooking anymore I haven't even really been getting dressed as much as I would like to and I have not been taking care of my body and my skin care in the way that I would like to either so for this next summer period and next year my goal is balance finding more balance finding a little hobby that I like carving out time for myself making sure that I make doing healthy habits and working out and cooking from scratch and prioritizing my health and wellness because as we all know there is a combination of good health and brain health and that also means I might be spending a little less time here and a little bit more time in the physical world mom because as my mom would say I'm burning the candle on both ends and it's always good to evaluate how you're spending your time and where you're spending your time and how it serves you but now I have to go play superheroes
