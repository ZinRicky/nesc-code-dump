my memory is fine Joe Biden can beat Donald Trump if he steps down a lover of democracy and my female bodily autonomy nothing makes me more nift than admitting that this is the beginning of the end for Joe Biden but what the special council has found that the president doesn't recall the years where he was vice president or the year when his son Bo died and that described him as as a sympathetic well meaning elderly man with a poor memory that during the press conference where he's trying to prove that his memory was fine that he confused the president of Egypt with the president of Mexico is going to be really hard to recover from we have going full doom and gloom which you can find a million articles doing this right now Joe Biden has the opportunity to turn his worst moment in his presidency into his best one by doing what Lyndon Johnson did in 1968 and step aside and let credit candidates batted out at the democratic convention Biden could effectively fulfill his promise of being a transitional figure and create space for the next person to come in and put his country first and prevent the democracy ending uh possibility of Trump getting a second term and while there's not a lot of viable candidates there's a lot of time before the election like I recognize all of those things are valid Joe Biden stepping down right now would actually also solve a lot of problems murders it means that Democrats could finally go after Trump for his biggest weakness apart from his 91 convictions his age and his unfitness for office right now they literally can't do that because yeah Trump is old but Biden is older and so that's just not an argument I mean it just opens them up to even more critique to make that argument oops forgot when his presidency ended he also forgot what city he was in in one of his recent rallies aggressive should be campaigning against this but they can't if Joe Biden is doing the same thing so Biden stepping down also solves one of the biggest threats to democracy right now which is apathy in order for Biden to win Democrats have to vote in drugs and right now the polls do not suggest that that's going to happen I mean half of young voters say that they're just not going to vote one of the reasons why they're not going to vote is because of Biden's handling of Gaza Biden wasn't trying to get reelected maybe he would be more bold or unconventional in how he's handling Gaza it would make space for a candidate who doesn't have the blood of 27,000 Palestinians on his hands at this point Arab and Muslim voters don't even wanna meet with Biden it's hard to see a path to victory without those contingency of voters especially in some states like Georgia and uh and Michigan mistakes are just too high like this isn't 2016 and 2020 where Trump was being like critical like credibly accused of crimes like is a proven abuser with facing so many criminal convictions that I wouldn't be able to list them in a 10 minute video he's also a well documented antisemite racist Islamophobe and a sexual like Texas Predator and Trump isn't even just a threat to like American democracy he's a threat to the world there's already so many right wing extreme authoritarian governments that are you know having a stronger grip in places like China and Russia to to have another like a second Trump term to have a second Trump presidency could just have irreversible consequences Joe Biden has an opportunity to make his Mark in history and opening up the field is risky but so is staying in the game
