Justice Alito dropped an absurd letter today explaining why he refuses to recuse himself from the January 6th cases coming before him even though his house flew “stop the steal” flags around January 6th let me explain on January 17th, 2021 so yeah, shortly after January 6th the Alito household was spotted flying an upside down American flag which symbolized the stop the steal campaign and recently it was reported that last summer his vacation home in New Jersey was flying this “appeal to heaven” flag which is often associated with President Trump the insurrection and the idea that we should be returning to a Christian theocracy When lawmakers Learned of this egregious display of bias they increasingly began calling on Alito to recuse himself from cases involving January 6th like their upcoming ruling on whether or not insurrectionists can be charged with obstruction and how accountable Donald Trump can be held for his role in trying to overthrow American democracy brace yourself he just blames his wife?? it was all Martha Anne's fault I had nothing to do with the flying of the flag I wasn't even aware of it until I was aware of it I asked her to take it down and she refused so there was just simply no additional steps that I could take to get the stop the steal sign off of my lawn and just declares that his wife's reasons for flying the flag aren't at all relevant for present purposes I don't know about you but I would say that it's pretty relevant um whether or not a Supreme Court justice's wife was flying an upside down American flag explicitly in support of an attempted coup Thats just me though but explains that she got in a dispute with a neighbor that greatly distressed her so her reaction was that she had to go and hang up an upside down American flag like and Samuel Alito who wrote the opinion to overturn Roe v Wade unironically wrote that she makes her own decisions and I have always respected her right to do so he goes on to admit that he was aware of the appeal to heaven flag but says that he didn't know what it meant and when you're a Supreme Court justice with a lifetime appointment why ask let's not forget that Justice Thomas's wife Ginni LED the stop the steel campaign and also attended the January 6th insurrection attempt he has also not recused himself from any relevant cases and when pressed on it claims that he and his wife just don't talk about politics there you have it everyone American democracy at its finest I'm the feminist lawyer comment with your thoughts and questions
