People will not stop talking about the NYX Fat Lip Drip Oil, and so I had to try it out today. It was 8 99, and it is in the shade supermodel. Is it just like a lip gloss? Like, I don't know. Let's test it out. I usually don't go for super pink shades, but I thought maybe I'll try it, and then, uh. I don't really love it. I don't feel like it's worth 8 99. I just feel like it's kind of sticky, not super shiny. Have a two dollar lip gloss that is way shinier and looks better. I don't know. I wanna take it off. Dang it. I wanted to love it. I was so excited. Why do people hype this up? Am I missing something? Did I do it wrong? Um, let me know. But until. Till I figure it out, it's a no go for me.
