if you've been following along with this series and you've ever wondered why it's taking me over a week to deep clean my entire kitchen this is why this is how I left it last night and this is how we're looking this morning granted I did have my nephew and niece staying alongside my own three children but still I'm literally pushing üí© up hill here I feel like every day I've been showing up in this kitchen and taking one step forward & 10 steps back but that's okay it's not like my sanity is hinging on the progress that I make in this room or anything So quick backstory I've decided that this month is gonna be the ultimate reset month for me getting around to all the jobs that have been on my to do list and I am deep cleaning deep cluttering and organising every space in the main area of my home I started off with the bathroom we have one bathroom which we're sharing at the moment between five of us and that took me hours hours and hours but it was worth it because now we have some systems and some organisation and then I set my sights on the kitchen I started with the fridge and I did that one afternoon the next day all I managed to do was the freezer the day after that I deep cleaned the pantry and pulled everything out and the following day I managed to restock and put it all back together the day after that I deep cleaned the exterior of this kitchen and that involved taking everything off every surface and then steaming it within an inch of its life we're on the home stretch now because the only task left to do is to clean out 20 drawers and a cupboard then put them all back together again so you know not that much and how am I feeling emotionally? thank you so much for asking well last night those five kids just would not go to sleep for the life of me so I'm feeling quite tired I'm also feeling like I'm really looking forward to the school term starting again they've been on holidays for 36 days and we've got 15 more to go not that I've been counting or anything and I'm also getting pretty sick of just standing here in this kitchen if I'm honest so I've decided come hell or high water we are getting this job completed today to set the scene for you it's a really hot day here in Aotearoa New Zealand and currently all I can hear is the beautiful songs of native birds, cicadas and the whooping and hollering of my brother and my husband who are two different people by the way while they're playing outside carefree in the pool with the kids and all I can think is I'm standing in this hot kitchen with my sore feet sweating my non existent üçí off you bastards I'm mostly joking but also how nice would it be to be a dad for just like one day anyway inevitably somebody's gonna tell me that my drawers are really full and I have a lot of stuff and like you're not wrong but also this kitchen is smaller than my last so we built this little cabinet and today I'm gonna finally stock her but first I'm gonna have a little sit down because I'm literally cooking When restocking the glasses I realised just how many have been broken lately We‚Äôve hosted a lot lately and I feel like every time people come over something gets broken but I didn't realise just how many until I restocked that drawer so I'm definitely gonna add ‚Äúbuy cute glasses‚Äù to my list of things to do question do all of your mugs match each other? or have you got an eclectic mix like me? I kinda like that they're all different though because I can pick any of those up and tell your story about it like there's one mug in there that my husband had as a baby and there's another mug in there that I bought 12 years ago when my first baby was a baby and that's why I can't part with them because they're sentimental I like things that have stories I actually just like stories in general I'll tell you another story so that you're not too worried about me standing in this hot kitchen all day because full transparency this whole day did take me about seven hours so when I was about halfway through I decided I was really hungry and so I made a sandwich but we had absolutely no bench space right all of the stuff that I pulled out of the drawers immediately went onto the bench so I had to make a hand sandwich not to be confused with a ham sandwich but a hand sandwich is a sandwich that you have to make and hold in one hand holding it and building it and eating it and I was making such a mess but oh my goodness that sandwich was the best sandwich I think I've ever had she hit the spot and then I snuck away and put my togs on and I say snuck away because those three kids I mentioned if they see me in my togs you are guaranteed that they are gonna wanna hop in the pool with me and this sounds kind of selfish and I don't mean it to be but honestly I was so hot and bothered I just needed a minute I needed to cool my core temperature down decompress and be left the hell alone so I stole a minute for a solo swim and my God it was amazing but then when I got back the taragon decided to test me so that was fun anyway so I'm trying to label all of these little jars right and I'm debating whether or not to tell you this because it's quite embarrassing but also it's real life so go on so I've had these little jars for over 3 years and I have never labelled them üôà so when I'm cooking I just rifle throw and sniff them all until I find the one that I'm looking for üôàüôà and it is not an effective workflow so I'm so pleased that their job is finally done you're allowed to judge me it's fine I'm judging on the topic of labels somebody commented on my label making video that they were concerned that I put the labels on the bottom and that I wouldn't be able to see them but I can see them on the bottom in the pantry just not in the spice drawer which is why I labelled them on the lid so that when I open it I know what the fkn I'm cooking with oh my goodness I think we're done and I'm so happy with how this cabinet turned out Got my fancy plates fancy glasses and some servingware alongside my cleaning stuff because they don't fit in the drawer and on this side we've got a cocktail making section and my small appliances so that I don't need to try and jam them into the drawer and if you're like me which I'm assuming that you are if you watched until this point then I don't need to tell you how good this feeling is just knowing that every surface has been sanitised every cupboard and every drawer has been organised the pantry has been done the freezer and it's not gonna last obviously but for right now it has scratched my brain in just the right way I asked my husband to do the oven because I thought he could do something and looking at it now I'm gonna have to do it again aren't I and if you've made it to the end of my longest ever TikTok thank you for keeping me company I fkn LOVE YOU üíïüíïüíï
