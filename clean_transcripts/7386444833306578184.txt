I don't know about a poorly drawn map but I'll give you a walk through shall I okay so this is the dining room and this is the room that we painted green if you remember that and off the dining room is the lounge and this is the room in question and I can see why you would want a map because she's fkn confusing hence why my brain has not been braining when it comes to figuring out this layout and this door is the door through to the entrance the entryway? entranceway? anyway we haven't done that space but if you come through here this is what you will see and if you think there is enough doors for one room you would be right but also so wrong because we have two more ways to get in here because if you walk out of my bedroom the this is what you will see my room also has another way of getting into it so they really wanted to make it so that you could enter any room like 10 different ways and finally if you come in off the two double doors onto our top deck patio thing this is what you'll be greeted with Now my eventual plan is to close in that door into that TV maybe make it a bit bigger but yeah did that help?
