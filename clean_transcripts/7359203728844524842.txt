I wanna talk about the dangers of being a stay at home mom as a stay at home mom in a Bravo fan and we're gonna relate this to Bravo Summerhouse and Kyle and Amanda I have always said that being a stay at home mom is a very dangerous position to put yourself in and it really really really does relies on your partner their ego and their sense of power dynamics catch you up to speed about Kyle and Amanda Kyle started his own company Lover Boy and as that company started game momentum he asked his then fiance now wife to quit her job to come help him full time at Loverboy she now I believe is the director or creative director or the director of marketing maybe both however fast forward to present time they've been married now for a year or two and they're starting to be cracks in the marriage and one of the things I'm starting to notice is that Kyle resents Amanda for depending on him for an income he also resents her and belittles her because he thinks he has full ownership full money making capabilities and this company is his own even though he asked his wife to leave her other paying job to come join his business that they would build together he clearly doesn't see it as both of their businesses my husband is a business owner I have never like gone to work with him in a full time capacity but I have dabbled here and there and he watches the show with me and we were deconstructing this and he was like there is such a reality that money comes with entitlement even if you don't want it to you almost have to check yourself because my husband has gotten in really busy times of his business where he feels that he is working so hard or making so much money that he feels entitled to an easier time at home we've talked through that and he's a very emotionally mature human being so like we're fine but Kyle and Amanda are not fine because you're watching this power dynamic dissolve the relationship into disgust into resentment and it is eating away at the affection that both of these people have for each other if they want this to continue in a healthy way Kyle needs to admit that he couldn't do this at all without Amanda and give her her fair due and respect necessary and realize that just because you're bringing home the bacon doesn't mean you get to drop all of your responsibilities as a husband and a potential father and Amanda needs to make sure that she is willing to deal with this man's ego and doesn't wanna have her own little pot of gold on the side where she can get the respect and monetary compensation that she may need one day when Mister Kyle she's sick of dealing with him is a classic cautionary tale for stay at home moms for people who could end up in a financial abusive situation with money comes entitlement comes power and if there's too much of an unequal power dynamic within a relationship that is a right possibility for abuse
