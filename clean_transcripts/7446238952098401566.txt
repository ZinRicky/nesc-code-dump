my father in law is in charge of Christmas stockings every year and he always fills it with things you really don't need but when he saw it he thought of you and it kind of made him chuckle so it is usually the most random things on the planet so this year I saw a revolver mug and it made me think of him so I am somehow going to fit this in stocking I don't know how but I had to buy it for him here's the revolver mug it spins it has a handle it also has a lid to keep his coffee hot this is the perfect father in law gift
