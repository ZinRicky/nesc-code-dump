Have you ever met a guy while dating, he's genuine, funny, smart, the most charismatic nice guy that you've ever met and then he opens up about his horror stories of his ex and you're like you? there's no way that happened to you. you're like the most genuine nice person, how does that even happen? Which got me thinking, Some women are ruining it for us, making men think that all women are horrible. So I think that we all need to step it up as woman, put some respect on women's names.
