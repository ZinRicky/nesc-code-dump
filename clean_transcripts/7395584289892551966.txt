okay so Hannah Neeleman is absolutely a victim ballerina farm she's absolutely a victim I think that man it sounds like he was like hunting her down like to entrap her and when they first got together um it sounds like she wanted to finish her education she was expecting to graduate from Juilliard but then she just magically found herself living with him and married and pregnant and she had to drop out and I think she's absolutely a victim but it's interesting that um when other women who talk about their lives and their dreams being stolen by their husbands and by having children um when people come on this app and talk about that it seems like the comment section is not as empathetic uh specifically I remember a video or maybe there's a couple videos of different like black mothers coming coming on here and talking about how they had a dream um before they had children and it's so hard and it's so devastating and then everyone in the comments is like you could have put this energy into pursuing your dream like instead you're on here like whining and crying to us and I don't think that's the response to like working class black mothers and I don't think that's the response to Hannah Nealman I think that um you guys need to check your misogyny because it really is just like I mean like people are saying they don't like Hannah Neeleman because she's white and she's wealthy she's not wealthy her husband is wealthy um and I think that that's just like their excuse for hating on a woman and then when it comes to the non white women who uh try to express the same frustration um obviously it's the same misogyny but with racism sprinkled on top to boot and um I just I think that we really need to think about like why so many of us and like women too like childless women um have developed a disdain for women who have children and they've developed a disdain for children themselves um I think that it's because and I made a video not long ago about how women who do have children how mothers can often have a disdain for childless women I think that now the childless women have taken that I kind of misdirected the frustration with the whole narrative that you should have children um or that a woman is just not complete unless uh she's a mother um I think it's really important to keep in mind that there are a lot of wives and mothers out there who are victims they are essentially like domestic slaves and um even though they take their frustration out on childless women it's so really important to remember that like children especially do not deserve your contempt and um these women who have been entrapped by men and entrapped into domestic slavery they they deserve your empathy
