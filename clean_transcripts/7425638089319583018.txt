today's the day well today and tomorrow really I promised the kids I would have this room put together by the time they come home from vacation tomorrow well it's not gonna be fully done because I think our carpet comes later this week and we've got a bench right here that's like a window seat and I don't know that's supposed to come by the end of the month anyway the rest of this stuff is going to be clean and organized for them lofty lofty goal but I've been putting it off way too long and I finally have all like the organizing bins that I need so I have no other excuse I'm going to get this done because we need to be able to homeschool so wish me luck
