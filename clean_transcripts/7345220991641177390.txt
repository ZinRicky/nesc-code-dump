passport bros are thriving, and you kind of have to respect it. there's a movement or trend spreading all across the US encouraging men to go get passports in order to find a high value marriage material wife three reasons why I think it's actually pretty great No. one they're seeking traditional values I think it's great that they want traditional feminine women to build a more authentic harmonious relationship with traditional women value family over having the next best thing and not only that they don't leave when things get hard or question a man's character or judgement in the relationship women with traditional values understand that you come as a unit you are one and you tackle life together with respect love and honouring each other with full devotion number two -they're taking action they're doing something about it they're not finding what they want out of a woman in a feminist world where they're entitled and treat men poorly finally taking control to find what makes them fulfilled in life three men are finding true love by exploring their options they're able to find partners who they can enjoy life with it's not about finding a woman who's more submissive but rather finding a woman who treats him right comes down to it it's all about mutual respect now you can absolutely find a woman in the US to marry that has traditional values and treats you right but most men will tell you that that is not easy men are seeking genuine, faithful women they just want a partner that they can trust The more I cover this topic the whole passport bros movement the more I understand why this movement is spreading like wildfire and almost have to respect these men because they're thriving because they're taking charge of their own lives
