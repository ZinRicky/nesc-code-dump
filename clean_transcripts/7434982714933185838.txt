yesterday my husband made fun of me because I was wearing a knit sweater and it was 88 degrees so when I put this shirt on today I locked it myself because again I look like I'm dressed for cold weather but it is in fact almost 90 degrees outside but here's the thing about me I grew up in a place that had fall I grew up wearing a long sleeve shirt and sweaters and sweatshirt and that is what I wanna wear in the fall so I'm going to turn the AC down and pretend that it's fall outside even though we are going to be going to our new lagoon this weekend and living all the fall Florida dreams because it's still actually like 90 degrees outside but I can pretend inside my own home I'm going to pretend that it is fall I'm gonna wear my long sleeve shirts and my sweaters and I'm gonna be so happy about it
