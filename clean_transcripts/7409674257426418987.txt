I posted this on my Instagram stories today because Hirsch Goldberg is one of these victims that they found killed in Gaza. They were hostages from October 7th. If you don't know, Hirsch is an American citizen and his parents had been working tirelessly to work towards a thieves fire to get their son home. I had heard so many stories through social media, just about what kind of man he was, about his parents love for him. So there is a deep sense of loss knowing that he will never come home. And of course a few people came into my DMs to tell me that it's a disgusting thing that I'm doing to even recognize um, these deaths when there's so many deaths happening in Gaza. And the crazy thing is I have posted more about Gaza times 100 then I posted about the Israeli hostages because I felt that the weight of the devastation that was happening in Gaza required more attention at this moment. But I feel like I just have to say this. I will not diminish anyone's humanity in order to justify the violence of either side. There's no justification for me for the amount of devastation happening in Gaza. And there is no justification for me for taking innocent hostages and murdering people at a music festival. You can disagree with me, but I think when you dehumanize people and you take away the significance of their life and their death, you are down A slippery slope. So I can hold empathy and grief for the innocent people being held hostage and being killed, and still hold empathy and grief for the thousands of innocent gossams being bombed now too. I still have two gofundme's in my account, but I would really like to hit their goals and get their family and them to safety.
