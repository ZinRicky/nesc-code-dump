Today we are making some sourdough discard goldfish for my toddler. I actually have this core memory of myself when I was pregnant towards the end, that I was like, I wanna be that mom that makes everything from scratch for her kids. And I just had no idea how I was gonna do it, because I truly did not make anything really from scratch when I was pregnant. And I was just looking back while I was making this for my daughter, and I just, like, was like, wow, I'm so proud of myself, because truly, I've came a long way. And I can't believe I'm making all these foods from scratch for my toddler, and I can't believe I've Learned how to do all this on my own. So that is a reminder that you can go from not cooking from scratch, not knowing how to cook, to completely changing it around and learning.
