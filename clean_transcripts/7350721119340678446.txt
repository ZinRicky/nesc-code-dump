In response to my video “Girl Language 101” why not just communicate? why play games? Well, I'll tell you why Maybe I'm generalizing but women are more likely to overthink, women are taught to be appeasing be polite and agreeable which plays a big role in how we're raised how we're being brought up. Just like how men are raised to be tough and not show their emotions In cases where we don't speak directly it might be because No. 1 we're afraid of causing bigger problems by voicing our concerns No. 2 women are often people pleasers basically we're afraid of hurting someone's feelings if we're too Frank with them No. 3 women filter and suppress certain impulses in order to maintain her image Women are taught that if they say what they actually mean, then they can face rejection criticism and judgement Honestly men consider women who are too forward to be masculine I realise I might be generalizing here but often times a woman's worth is tied to being voiceless and nice maybe that's why we don't know how to communicate? And it's not necessarily that we're playing games.
