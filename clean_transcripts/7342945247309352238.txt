Did you guys know that there's a trend, encouraging men to all get passports and travel abroad. It’s not just for sights or good food.. no, no it's to find wives, to find women who are more traditional, They are travelling all across the world just to find women who are more humble, more feminine, and willing to treat their men better than women in the U.S. They’re travelling to places like Italy, Thailand, Brazil, just to find women who will treat them right. The Passport Bros ideology is that they're escaping the hatred of feminist women, and are travelling somewhere they can thrive. They believe the ideology that by seeking foreign women, they can find a more authentic, fulfilling, and harmonious relationship. this is seen as a way to restore the natural balance between masculine and feminine energy. This is triggering some women, because they think that these men are interested in finding these women because men think they will be more submissive I’m not sure if this trend/movement is gonna end or only get worse! what do you guys think?
