before we start our homeschooling this room has got to get cleaned up this is not my mess so the people responsible for it will be cleaning it up but it's December I've been going back and forth about what I wanna do for the holidays I know that I already have a Christmas around the world study but I have no idea where it is since I can't find it I'm gonna use the chosen Adventures Holiday Kit we're gonna learn about Jesus's life and tied into an advent study before I can even plan I have to film the dates on my calendar this is my least favorite part of my homeschool calendar I appreciate that I can start and end the school year whenever I want but having to fill in the date is really annoying I usually do it a month at a time and then when the new month starts I forgot all about thankfully the kids are at the movies with their dad and I had plenty of time to just sit and play by my I decided to keep school pretty normal through December except I'm gonna pause you as geography and do something for Christmas I'm thinking I'm just gonna keep it really low key and read it Christmas Story every day that way if we think of something else we wanna do we can have time to do I try to keep our homeschooling really low key this time of year so I can say yes to the fun holiday things without getting burned out
