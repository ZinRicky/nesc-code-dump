so my husband and I went on our first child free vacation this summer and it was amazing but we had an overnight flight and the number one thing that I absolutely knew I was going to bring was a pair of really good noise cancelling headphones because I've talked on this app endlessly about kids belonging in public spaces and kids belonging on airplanes but that doesn't mean that I also like the noise the whole time so being an adult and being responsible for my own peace I bought myself a pair of noise cancelling headphones off of TikTok shop and these worked amazing okay they not only drown out any airplane noise static noise I get really overstimulated with the general humming of the airplane as well and any kids making any noise we have another trip coming up this winter and I will absolutely be bringing these because you cannot control kids on airplanes at least not all the time but you can't control your peace you can find these in TikTok Shop and I highly recommend you bring them and stop complaining about kids on airplanes
