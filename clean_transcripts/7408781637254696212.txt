one of my favourite pastimes is to come up with new ways to trick my children into eating their vegetables and would you believe that this spaghetti and meatballs has 12 hidden veggies in it They didn't believe it either because I didn't tell them and they didn't guess In the Ninja Foodi Hot Cold Blender I put onion garlic carrot courgette mushrooms and spinach alongside a little bit of oil and I blended that on medium speed until the paste came together in a large mixing bowl I popped a kilo of ground beef mince 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs two tablespoons of dried oregano and dried mixed herbs 1/4 cup of Parmesan my egg and my veggie paste give it a mix and then roll it out into balls I'm only using half of my mixture and the other half is going in the freezer for later in the week and I'm popping the meatballs in the fridge while I get started on my sauce we've got onion garlic capsicum mushrooms a can of chopped tomatoes and some fresh parsley I've also added dried oregano mixed herbs and salt and pepper measured with my heart and I put my Ninja Foodi on the sauce/dip setting so it's gonna do all the work cooking and blending it for me while I get cracking on cooking the rest of the dinner and I've noticed that this blender has an ice cream setting a cocktail setting and a frozen drink setting in case I wanna make a Margarita which I do I do wanna make a Margarita once my sauce was done I just poured it over my browned meatballs then I popped my meatballs and sauce on top of a bed of spaghetti topped with Parmesan and some Italian flat leaf parsley this meal went down a treat and they didn't even know they were eating veggies
