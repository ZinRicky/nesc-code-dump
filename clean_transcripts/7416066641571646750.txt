do you feel the vibes okay good let me tell you my vision my kids want to share a room in the new house but one was an animal theme and one was a Dinosaur theme so I thought how can I merge these two ideas together and I thought of a mountain theme on one wall we're gonna have this big mountain mural and when I think of sleeping in the mountains I think of the stars and the beautiful night sky so I had to get this Galaxy Star projector it has music it's Bluetooth it has a beautiful night galaxy sky The Galaxy Starlight is going to make them feel like one is sleeping with the animals and one is sleeping with the dinosaurs it is going to help set the whole mood for the entire room and of course I had to try it out to see if it fit the vibe and my kids are already so obsessed this is their favorite thing at that time so if your kids love the Galaxy Stars all the things you wanna get this too
