Here's everything I make in an afternoon as a mom who was just traveling for the past three weeks and needs to get back into her healthy routine. Part 2. After straining my chicken bone broth, I threw together a wild salmon salad for lunch using ingredients in my pantry. You'll never find tuna in my pantry because it's high in mercury and something I try to avoid. I whipped up a homemade Mayo yogurt using two orange yolks for my backyard chickens, extra virgin olive oil, Dijon, half a lemon for my tree, and mineral rich sea salt. Mayo is a super food when you make it yourself rather than the store bought trash that's got seed oils. I still have some pickled green peaches from last year's harvest, so I added these in. When the broth was chilled, I scooped off the nutrient dense fat and stored that for later cooking uses. I remove the fat from my broth so that we don't overdose on it. I like to know how much fat I'm adding into a meal and this is the best way to do it. When it was time to get dinner started, I harvested some zucchini from my garden and then created a casserole by adding shredded chicken, quinoa, gelatinous broth, tomato sauce, and raw cheese to a Dutch oven. This is a really easy meal to throw together for a family as it doesn't require much skill or thought. Dinner baked for over an Hour when the keto was set. Next time I'll give myself a little more time for the bake. But I started a bit late. Before bed, I fed my sourdough starter so it would be ready to bake bread in the morning.
