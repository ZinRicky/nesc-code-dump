I bought this dress back in January with the intention of wearing it for summer, and now Summer's here. Best thing I've ever gotten off of TikTok. It's so cute. I'm 5 foot 5, and it's very, very long on me. I'm wearing these, like, big heels just so I can show you. Super cute. Ignore the neighbor's dog. They're, like, playing out there and barking a bunch. But amazing dress. I love it. It ties right here. And you can change it so you can, like, tie it a different way. I've seen girls do it, like, up the middle. Um, yeah. I just love it so much. I think every girl needs it for summer.
