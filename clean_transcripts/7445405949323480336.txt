while we're all waiting for the pool to fill up I thought I would just quickly renovate the kitchen and one of my specialties is gaslighting myself into believing that a project's gonna be quicker and easier than it turns out to be and honestly if I didn't have that blind delusional faith driving me each day I probably wouldn't attempt anything and the plan here is just to give her a wee facelift because functionally there's nothing wrong with her but aesthetically it's not for me we started the same way we did the pool really by removing all of the old tiles and then the boys from architectural stone came and removed the old benchtops and installed the new ones I chose a beautiful piece of Dekton from Cosentino which I'll show you soon before the sink and the tap went in and now the hard work really begins because I basically wanna tile as much of the kitchen as as humanly possible if you're new here we've spent the last year and a half restoring our beautiful but kind of beat up mid century home and we've tackled a few projects that involve tiling and I have surprised myself with how much I enjoy doing it I mixed up some tile adhesive which is much like baking a cake except you know a lot easier popped up the tile trim and then notched the adhesive as if I actually know what I'm doing and then I got to work positioning the tiles and these are the Kreuz tiles in Matte White which is a porcelain Japanese Kitkat tile from TileSpace one thing I love about these tiles aside from how cute they are is that they come with a mesh backing so they're so easy to apply so much easier than the pool tiles that had that adhesive on the front I have a bit of a crazy vision with where and how I want these tiles placed and at this point I'm feeling kinda nervous only because I want them kind of everywhere and I hope it's not gonna be too much but the vision for this project is just to lighten and brighten The natural light in here already isn't great but having all of those dark finishes just made it feel a lot dingier than it needed to be if you've seen any of my other room renovations you will know I love using colour but for the kitchen I wanna go for clean natural and textured we took the tiles right to the ceiling but then this extractor fan was really getting to me to be honest and some people might like this look it's not terrible I suppose but for me I just fkn hate looking at it and I am very fortunate to be married to a man who's easily bribed once I corrupted him he built me a box added some moulding so it seamlessly blended with the ceiling and tiled it I would have done it myself but the ceilings are actually really high and I said I couldn't reach, so.. he cut some slits into each side for ventilation and then it was time to grout which was terrifying I started with a sample of light grout but we kinda lost the shape and the impact of the tile and it made them throw yellow which just looked like stained teeth if I'm honest I never actually thought I'd be a dark grout girly but here we are and I think it was the move and I'm so sorry but full reveal in the next part
