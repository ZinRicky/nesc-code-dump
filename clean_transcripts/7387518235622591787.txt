I am so tired and I really wanna take a nap but Maverick has speech therapy in 45 minutes so I cannot do that I guess I could go work out and that's what I did very reluctantly might I add I've never really been into working out or going to the gym I played soccer growing up and did intermerial sports in college I even dabbled in running but really only for the social aspect it's been 10 years since then and I have become quite the couch potato but I wanna set a better example for my kids so in this season of improving my health and becoming a better version of myself I've started doing at home Pilates workouts using the peloton at worked out for 30 minutes but man am I feeling it today
