guys I'm visiting Paris for the first time um first thing I did when I came here was I came to the flea market I got a little espresso um very good and I'm not even a fan of coffee um and then okay here's what I've gotten so far first thing I got this vintage teaspoon â‚¬3 cool fun then I got this like little pendant and it's an old it's a picture of an old like fat man and I just love um like vintage images of fat people because like a reminder that we've always existed um and then I got this silk scarf which I think is so beautiful hundred percent silk and I'm thinking about either like wearing it like that kind of vibe or in my hair obviously um and then or in my neck I don't know it's France we'll see what the vibe is um then I got this little coin purse and I have in here seven um seven euros which means that I spent on all the things that I bought four things I spent 23 euros which I think is really exciting anyways I have a really good time I'm really excited and if you have any suggestions on what I should do my first time in Paris please let me know
