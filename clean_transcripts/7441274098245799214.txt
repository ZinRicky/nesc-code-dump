We can't have sugar for breakfast this time. No. You want them? You can have them for a snack later today, but for breakfast, you can have an egg and yogurt and bananas. Yeah, that's how it's gonna have to be. Today is Monday, so Mondays I do a reset of the house because I take Sundays off. So let's get started. Today I made these brownies, and they are so good. My husband took half of them to work with him today because they are just that good. And it is from time and tenderness. Victoria on here. Her recipe is phenomenal. One fire at a time. I'm a red pajama waiting. Waiting for his mama. My blanket. It's a jingle bell. Jingle bells.
