one thing about people on the internet is they're going to villainize fat people this person made an entire threat about how “toned deaf” this fatties for Free Palestine shirt and post were talking about how somehow this post that is saying systems of white supremacy and colonialism are the kindling fuel and flames of genocide they're also the root of fatphobia for those of you who can't read that means that the hatred of white supremacy is the reason for the genocide of Palestinian and white supremacy is an overarching systemic thing that contributes to the oppression of all oppressed people which is objectively true the creator was a Palestinian fat creator and she reached out to a bunch of fat creators myself included and all the proceeds from this shirt are going to Palestine and of course the comments are completely filled with fat phobia and talking about how you know tone deaf this is blah blah blah like whatever and the thing is if you have a shirt that's like Queers for Palestine or Jews for Palestine or whatever like there is not any push back because it's understandable that you're going to call for solidarity because we understand that oppression is an intersectional issue this is not comparing the tragedy it's just saying we all in this in group (fat ppl) need to care about Palestine and this is particularly important because in the beginning around October 7th I remember it was like a really big issue in the fat community about how no one has spoken up about it and like fat liberation is an inherently political issue and these people who are so called activist weren't talking about Palestine and some people still aren't they're trying to call attention to the fact that all oppression is linked and it's important if you're part of an oppressed group to actually fight for the liberation of all oppressed groups like that is uh intersectionality 101 and again this was made by a Palestinian creator like this creator is doing what she can within her power to amplify support for Palestine and like is asking other people in her community to support her which we are it is absolutely not your right to dictate how a member of an oppressed group is going to go about dealing with their oppression y'all claim to be activist but the second a fat person enters a conversation you become a conservative so easy so anyways all the proceeds of this should go to the Middle Eastern Children's Alliance if you are a person who supports Palestine I recommend buying the shirt hundred percent of the proceeds go to the Middle Eastern Children's Alliance this is a fundraiser done by Palestinian person for Palestinian people fatties for free Palestine
