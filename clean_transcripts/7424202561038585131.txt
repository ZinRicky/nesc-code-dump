one thing we don't talk enough about in the discussions of motherhood and stay at home mom motherhood is the economics of happiness now I know we always have to say that money doesn't buy you happiness but what can buy you is an easier life and when it comes to being a stay at home mom that is such an crucial conversation because I have been a stay at home mom for 10 years we are not in the same financial situation as we were when I started and that has made a humongous difference now we were never really struggling financially but we were definitely not in the same place that we are now so when I talk about being happy being a stay home mom about job satisfaction in the role right um these are things that you need to take into consideration especially when you're consuming motherhood content online comparing your life to theirs because I would say there's three things that greatly greatly affect your happiness as a stay at home parent 1 your partner how involved in participatory your partner is will make or break your experience number two I would say is finances your ability to outsource any of the duties that are under your umbrella will greatly change your perspective on being a stay home mom you know anyone can be hashtag blessed when they can take a date night when they need it or hire a cleaner to help out and third and somewhat related I would say is your mental and physical health cause even if you were married to the most amazing partner in the world and you have the funds to be able to outsource any sort of domestic labour you want if you are struggling mentally you will be living in a prison of your own mind and that is a complete crap shoot and affects people of both high and low income however those with expendable income will have better access to mental health services and people to watch your children for you to get a break so still still a factor everyone experiencing motherhood is experiencing motherhood in a completely different way and these factors factor in to how well they're gonna be coping with the stresses both physical and mental of the role so in order to be an informed consumer of social media especially surrounding something dude so deeply personal and intimate as a motherhood journey please keep in mind those three factors because they make or break someone's experience no I don't mean that everybody with expendable income is going to have a easy time in motherhood and I'm not saying that everybody who is doing every single domestic job and has no breaks isn't going to be possible to be having a great time either I'm just saying when you're watching creators and you're comparing yourselves to things you see online to keep in mind that the economics of happiness plays a role the village is important if you don't have it by birth or by community having the funds to pay for it will make things easier because the village has always been necessary in child rearing
