let them eat cake as a woman who loves fashion and is usually very interested in what everybody's wearing at the Met Gala and usually like awaits all spring to watch the Met Gala This year was the weirdest dystopian hellscape of a performance I have ever seen in my life I didn't even watch the red carpet of the Met Gala and that's usually something I find much more interesting than the Grammys or the Oscars etcetera and I couldn't watch it because it's obscene and it was probably always obscene but there's something like very Hunger Games to ask and I know everybody's been making that comparison but it is so Hunger Games adjacent it's probably always been this obscene but like the juxtaposition of what's going on in the actual world right now with the Met Gala it is just so stark because of what's going on like there is an income inequality there is a wealth gap that is bigger than it was in the French Revolution so the tone deafness to post something like this is beyond not to mention I looked up the actual theme of the mechala this year and it's actually based on the story that has a lot to do with like class inequality and these like super rich people tryna fight off this horde of angry peasants basically with magic and time time turning which like is a little on the nose for also like right now it's almost like this year they were like yeah we know what we're doing and we want you to know that we know what we're doing and I'm not saying that everything has to be about everything else like I appreciate art I love fashion I think you can have an appreciation of like beauty in a sense that like art is important even in the darkest of times however this is not art for art's sake necessarily this is an elaborate show of wealth and literally with everything that's going on in Palestine it it's just it's gross and it felt gross this year it just and everyone still slayed but like it the whole event felt icky
