my six year old just wrecked me and made me feel like the world's worst mother not my finest moment not my finest hour I will give you that but it is co op day and it is rainy cloudy we need our rain gear and our water shoes couldn't find any of it it's all misplaced some's at the grandparents house who knows where the shoes are no clue I'm yelling at them about the clutter in the room and not keeping track of their stuff it was just not a good morning so we we go to do drop off without the reindeer without the water shoes it is what it is and my six year old just melts down and cries because he just wants to stay home and clean his room and find his stuff and now he has to go to farm school without water shoes and without a rain jacket yes I do feel very guilty in this moment
