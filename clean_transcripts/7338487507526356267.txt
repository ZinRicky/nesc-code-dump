can someone please tell me what an inappropriate gym outfit is? because I just saw a video of a girl doing a video explaining how a guy was saying how women dress inappropriately at the gym and they need to dress more modest you go to the comments you run there and no one is saying what an inappropriate gym outfit is um which got me thinking, like is anything actually inappropriate? or do people just feel uncomfortable around women with curves or bodies? no one explains it, truly what is an inappropriate gym outfit? is it a sports bra and shorts? is it a skin tight bodysuit? leggings that go right up your but? what is it? I'm curious I just wanna know
