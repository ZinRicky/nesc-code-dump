I saw this girl make a TikTok about why her marriage is so successful and why they're so happy they've been together for years and they're not in the honeymoon phase after I heard this information really opened my eyes to how I can improve my relationship She said that they stopped trying to hurt each other right or wrong I think a lot of couples struggle with this sorry (Struggle, I can never sit still unless I’m in my car) think a lot of couples struggle with always trying to prove each other right or wrong well that's not necessarily helping your relationship who are you guys trying to prove anything to that was the useful information that she shared and I will definitely be considering this whenever we're in discussions and it doesn't matter there's no reason why you should prove each other right or wrong I’ll tag the girl if I can find her I can't remember her name but I see her on TikTok all the time so hopefully I can find her Her advice was great so I thought I would share as well because I know I'm taking her advice. 💗🙏🏼
