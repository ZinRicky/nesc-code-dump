So the other day, I got really pissed, and I was like, I never have anything for me. The kids always come first. They get everything. All the underwear old. And I bought, like, 600 pairs of underwear, apparently, from the TikTok shop. I'm not mad about it, but I did forget about it. But they're really nice. They're stretchy. These do not have the scalp edge. But look, they do have this, like, really slight little V. So there's a million colors. And it's, like, super, super cheap. And it's linked right here. If you are also a mom with shitty underwear and you need new underwear, TikTok tops got you.
