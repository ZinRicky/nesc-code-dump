today is day one of Shark Week and these are some of the activities my kids did they worked on letter formation and writing skills by writing the names of each shark they practice greater than less than equal to with numbers to 100 we pretended that the greater than lesson sign was a shark and an easy the greater number of fish nav named it park the shark and sis named it Sally the shark then they played a reading activity called feed the Shark Madison fed the shark s H words Maverick fed the shark CVC and open syllable words like to have a lot of letter manipulatives on hand so they can both be working on these activities at the same time Madison is using banana grams and Maverick is using letter erasers from the target dollar section using letters is more sensory focus than writing and I wanted to keep this a reading activity and not a writing activity and of course they had to turn their lunch snack board into a shark feeding frenzy and spent 30 minutes playing with their food
