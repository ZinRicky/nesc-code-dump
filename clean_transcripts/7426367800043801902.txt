You can tell if a marriage will fail or not by the way a woman treats her man. Okay, hear me out. If a woman doesn't appreciate her man, doesn't support him, respect him, give him his flowers, and not literally, but figuratively, then that marriage will fail. Or worse, it'll leave the guy cheating on her. If a man does not feel appreciated and supported, that marriage will never, ever last.
