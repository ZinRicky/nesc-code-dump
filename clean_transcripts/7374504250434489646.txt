this is one of my least favorite responses when I say how badly fat people are treated on the internet I get a response like what did you expect it was the internet that's your fault but you're the one putting it out there like actually I hate that rhetoric cause it's like is it not your choice to be a bad person like it's not your choice to be cruel you act as if people are inherently bad and I just don't think that's the case can we not hope for better can I can I not hope that people will decide to be kinder and better and hope that human beings are capable of change and like capable of actually becoming kinder more empathetic and like treating people well like yes it’s the internet people are mean I'm very aware of that like that doesn't mean that it's right it doesn't mean that we shouldn't try and change that just because people are mean doesn't mean I should not hope they decide to be nice and like when I post on the internet I'm not consenting to be harassed or like bullied essentially by other grown adults I'm putting my content out there for like my followers especially don't consent when people take my videos and put it to a different platform that I have no control over that’s normalize yeah doesn't make it right I'm of the belief that people are able to choose whether or not they're good and kind people and just because that's just how it is doesn't mean we should stop working to make the internet a better kinder place it would be better for everyone if we weren't as cruel and weren't as quick to judge I'm so tired of this like pessimistic world view where everyone just like sucks literally just be nice to people
