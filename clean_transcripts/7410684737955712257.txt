yesterday I accidentally deep cleaned the front facade of my home which means today we've gotta make it look pretty and I think I'm experiencing a bit of avoidance right now cause realistically I should be in the kitchen finishing that room renovation off but my brain told me it was very important to tart up the front step and it must be done ✨immediately✨ and I'm just here for the ride, honestly So I mixed up a concoction of blood and bone compost and potting mix and then in went my plants we got some white lavender called the Snow Princess and the little daisy looking one is paper cascade and then I got some teeny tiny baby Alyssum which I'm just gonna have to be very patient with cause eventually they'll grow down the side of the pot and come out in gorgeous white flowers and they're all surrounding a beautiful bay Laurel tree so I can use the leaves in my cooking But mother was heavy so my husband quickly reminded me exactly why I married him the pot fitted perfectly praised babe but can I just quickly remind you of the state of it yesterday it was.. fkn depressing if I'm honest but after a little bit of cleaning and a new plant is already looking so much better but we're not done yet and aside from the obvious fact that it needs paint and pavers apparently it also needs me to paint it a custom doormat?? so come back for that shit show
