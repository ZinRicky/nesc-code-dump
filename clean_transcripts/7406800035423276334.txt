if you are in a situation where you are relying on someone else for your money to survive I am begging you from the bottom of my heart right now if you do not have one go to a bank open something up in your name only your name that no one else can touch and no one else can access so if god forbid the situation becomes abusive or you know there's there's an issue where you have to leave immediately like you have the ability and the liberty to go on your own and not rely on this person so often people get stuck in abusive relationships because they do not have the financial ability to leave most often I see this with young women and older men who control all the money and they're in these relationships with these men with no safety net and it just it's so horrifying to watch I get that people don't wanna think about the end of a relationship but like it's for your safety you have to make sure that you have the ability to leave a situation and then support yourself for some time after you leaving that situation if you're getting some type of cash an allowance whatever from this person take some of it and put it directly in the bank and make sure he also does not know about it has no way to access it if he's not giving you money if it's just like buying you things rather than focusing on like bags and designer bla bla bla focus on things that have appreciating value (and are easy to leave with) for example like gold like that getting jewelry that you can sell if god forbid you in a position where you need to do something and do not let them know if you're a wife and like you're the homemaker and your husband is a breadwinner like when you go grocery shopping every once in a while get a gift card to the place that sells the grocery get a visa gift card here and there that you can spend take out some money and just like hide it away obviously this is people who have the financial means to do so but like you have to prepare and make sure that you are ready for any situation that happens because horrifying watching time and time again women be stuck in positions where they should not be because they do not have the financial means to leave because they relied on someone else you can absolutely rely on someone else I'm just begging you to be prepared for the worst case scenario
