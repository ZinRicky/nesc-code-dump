no it hasn't escaped my notice at all that the only people who take issue with something I said in my last video are men now it goes without saying that that was a message that could be applied to all parents but the story that I was telling was specific to dads so I said dads y'all get the biggest feelings about the dumbest shit cause y'all would rather defend this random stranger that you've never met for his poor taste comment about his own child than listen to like anything that was actually said or the implications of saying things like that on your daughters or women in general y'all are gross you don't deserve women
