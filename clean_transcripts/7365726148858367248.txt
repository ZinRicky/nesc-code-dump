How to dress for the Female Gaze. The female gaze is all about comfort and creativity over flattery. So let's start with a maxi skirt. It can be any color, fabric or print that you like. Time to add a layer on top. Choose your comfiest, chunkiest, oversized knit. For shoes, let's make a statement with either a bold color or a chunky silhouette. Let's accessorize. The more bling the better. Then we'll add some interest with a hat that doesn't match the vibe of the skirt and some sort of Bandana or scarf. Finally, let's add a bag that matches the vibe or color of our shoes. And now that your outfit is focused on interest rather than flattery, you're dressed for the female gaze.
