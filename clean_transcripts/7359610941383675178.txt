not my dinner being ruined by a bunch of Zionists we're with my friends who had a DJ set in the East Village and after we went to go get food we like just sat down and then these guys come in and like immediately start talking to us and the thing is I'm lovely and friendly and kind so I talk to strangers like and when someone looks me in the eye I will speak to them I know it's not very New York but you know and these guys are talking to me he's like oh like are you guys from Columbia I was like oh no like NYU blah blah like we graduated like being normal and friendly like a normal human being and they were like well we just came back from Columbia da da da like oh like were you at the protest like whatever again not assuming anything my bad my hecking bad and we're like chitting and chatting and then one of them goes yeah I haven't had bread in like you know since like yesterday um I was like oh like why and he's like well I'm like I'm fasting and it's like it wasn't didn't eid already happen I was like I don't know so I'm like maybe I'm wrong but he's like oh yeah no yeah like it like it did um it was like so like are you like are you still fasting like what's and then like uh uh yeah and I was like okay sure and they kept like looking at us and talking to us and I again like I'm not going to assume people are being malicious and that's my bad like every time I go to like talk to my friends and they like catch my eye and like keep talking I'm like okay and they just keep saying things and I'm like am I like too hecked up to like understand what you're saying like it cause not making sense and one point they go like what are your pronouns I was like oh and mind you this is three straight guys I'm like oh um oh like you know she they like he they she her like whatever and then he kept repeating like okay she her she her she her she her she they she and and and he's like this is how I remember it I was like oh yeah he's a guy cause you can't mess it up I was like okay after he asked for our pronouns we're like oh like what's yours he's like he and zim and I was like no okay okay there's not one person at that table that is using neo pronoun and then at one point they go like are you guys imperialist or I was like no he's like oh like communist I was like yeah um and like they giggle I'm like okay and he's like are you a Marxist like whatever I'm like you know I'm like I'm socialist like my you know political beliefs are you know one in practice and one in theory like blah blah blah blah well you should read marx and lenin things were like bad in their time but like you know like they have some good ideas I like could tell that like their their vibe was bad and weird and I was like I couldn't tell what the joke was i’m a regular there so the owner could tell that like they were being weird towards us so he's like you guys have to go you guys have to go like whatever mind you this man is Pakistani right he's like this is like brown man right um and then they're like oh so you're racist you're rac!st against us like that's why you're not letting us say and then they're like my friend has like mental disorder like he can show you his card and they're like he has tism no he doesn't like I like what it what it was so weird their vibe was so weird and so bad and like you know when a white person uses AAVE and like it just sounds wrong coming out of their mouth they were using like leftist language but in a way that like you could tell this is there like there there is not something that is like native to their vocabulary do you know what I mean and it's like not only do people dislike Zi0nists because of their like you know politics and the fact that they're like supporting a g cide it's also your vibe hecking sucks your vibe is so bad mind you we don't know these people we didn’t say anything to these people I was nothing but nice and cheerful and sweet and saying hello like when they said hi to me like and then they I mean to be fair they clocked me they clocked me as a as a pro Pa|estinian leftist like that they thought that they could fuck with like sure yeah anyways once I clocked they were Zi0nists I start laughing with my friends because I'm like why are these stupid Zi0nists like engaging with us like why are they talking to us and their vibe immediately shifted it cause like they were like like they're like oh like why are you laughing what's funny like what what's funny what's so funny I was like oh I'm just like laughing at Zi0nists and then like like what's like funny I was like oh just like you know the fact that their entire political ideology is based on hatred and like the bad evil people and they're going to hell like blah blah blah and like his face fell because like no longer was he the one in charge of the joke is now me in charge of the joke but they didn't wanna like give up the fact that they were also Zi0nists like clearly um and then like yeah like yeah anyways the other friend comes back from the bathroom and I overhear him say like bro like you should have heard what she said about Zi0nists and I was like right right right and then one of them was staring at me and I like look back I'm like what like what and he's like well you're staring at me I was like you're staring at me and his friends like oh like there's some tension should we cut it I was like I'm gay and he's like well he's gay well he's not gay he's bi and the other friend goes well he's like he's not bi he's questioning cause like at Coachella last year he hooked up with a trans and I was like a what he's like a transgender it's like and I was like no like I know what transgender people are I mean like a trans man or a trans woman and he's like uh like a trans woman I was like oh and I was gonna say that doesn't make you bisexual but whatever a trans please and I was like you know when you use language that is not part of your vocabulary you're like putting it like playing with it it's very clear it's not language that you use regularly like it's very very clear to everyone and they're like what do you mean like what like are you like making fun of the fact that I'm gay like blah blah blah like I was like where did I do that where did I say that and they were like they were trying to make fun of me by being on my side it was so weird and eventually my friend is just like stop like why she engaging with us and she's like well this is what people do when like this is what people do when they're scared of men and like they don't wanna be harassed I don't know if they knew me from like nightlife or the knew me from social media or if they just like walked in and clocked that we were like pro Pa|estine I mean I don't know if that's a vibe I give off if it is good hopefully but like I don't know why they like went out of their way to like try and bully us by being on I don't know they were like the embodiment of like a Twitter troll come to life and like I have this disease where I'm unable to keep my mouth shut so like I couldn't like not engaged but honestly I regret doing it because I feel bad I didn't mean to put my friends in a position where they had to interact with Zi0nists like anyways at the end I went to pay and then like they were like oh like bye it's like my friend and my friends like bye oh my god we should get a picture to commemorate our night together and she went to take a picture of them and they all hid their faces so that was a trio of Zi0nists and I will say it isn't there's nothing like interacting with Zi0nists in real life to reaffirm the fact that they are nothing but hecking losers
