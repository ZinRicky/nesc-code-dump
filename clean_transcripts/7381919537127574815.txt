ask what can I do to be more forgiving of myself and more in love more easily how to fall in love more easily or be in love more easily accept my wife for who she is a champion who she is not make her a version of that I think she's supposed to be but rather embrace and highlight and champion and elevate who and what she is and when I do that which um I feel like I do pretty well but always a work in progress um you find that you're in love you're not comparing her to what the version that you think she's supposed to be or to someone else's spouse or partner right um I think you fall in love much more easily when you accept the person that you are trying to be in love with wow that's pretty profound
