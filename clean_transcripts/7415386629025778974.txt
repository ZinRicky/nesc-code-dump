These night lights are a must if your kids are afraid of the dark. They are perfect because they are a dimmable and motion sensor. I got them to put in the hallway between my kids room in the bathroom. I don't want a light that stays on all night, but I also need a light so they're not afraid to go to the bathroom. That's what makes these kin deep night lights so perfect. I can set them to stay on, I can set them to be motion sensors and I can control the brightness. I don't know about you, but I don't wanna get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and be blinded by my night light. I wanna stay half asleep so I can go back to sleep real fast. So if you are anything like me, grab yourself some of these night lights from the TikTok shop.
