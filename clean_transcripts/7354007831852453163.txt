All Women are innately born with the capability and desire to nurture. We literally produce life. So saying you're a feminist and I don't have to take care of my husband is a lie. Western culture and society has tried instill these views on us When in reality being a nurturing mom/wife is truly ingrained into us Instincts do not lie, so you should stop letting society tell you how to run your marriage. That's not your job, it's your husband's. You are allowed to be successful and have a career, while still taking care of the ones we love. Women who are nurturing are generally happier.
