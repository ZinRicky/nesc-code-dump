I might be in the minority here, but there is one type of holiday decor that I hate more than anything, and that is lawn inflatables. I cringe when I see them. I do not like them. I do not want them. My husband just informed me that he did, in fact, buy the kids a Halloween salon inflatable, and he is so excited to surprise them when he gets home. I'm cringing. He's like, I can put it in the backyard so nobody else will see it. I'm like, no, that means I have to look at it put in the front yard where I can't see it. Oh, man, this is what marriage is like.
