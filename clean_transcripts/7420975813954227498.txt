American women god designed you this way you I don't…I don't care if you like to hear this or not it doesn’t really matter god designed you this way so it is the way it is right but your number one priority…the first thing your first priority should be taking care of a man and the first…your first priority should be taking care of an American man he reminds me of this table book that I have it's called Are Men Obsolete and it's actually a transcript of a debate that took place in 2013 in Toronto and the debaters look at just how much gender norms have changed in the last 100 years so for tens of thousands of years men were just assumed to be the dominant secks and they primarily relied on law religion and brute force as a means to force women to stay with them or make it nearly impossible for women to lead a life without a male companion but everything has changed in the last 100 years women have came bursting into all of these spaces that we were historically excluded from so the workforce education politics sports everything and a lot of men just haven't adapted instead of just evolving there's a whole group of men like this creator who are just trying to bring back the good old days trying to once again use religion to tell women that god (conveniently also a male had a male son and his 12 male best friends) all said that your purpose and your highest priority should be to serve men they're trying to bring back laws that we know have the consequence of making it harder for women to leave male partners by eliminating access to abortion and reducing access to contraception conservatives are also trying to make it harder to get a divorce they wanna end no fault divorce and it should be noted that women initiate nearly 70% of divorces so if you make it harder to get a divorce you are disproportionately impacting women's ability to leave male partners anyways recommend this little book here really short uh if you get it let me know what you think.. are men obsolete?
