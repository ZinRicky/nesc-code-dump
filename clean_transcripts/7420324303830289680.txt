I think I might have accidentally dressed for my Venus sign or something cause I felt like an actual princess not here obviously at this point I felt like a mole rat but if there's a plane involved there should also be a tracksuit involved and I think that's how we should all travel and you can't convince me otherwise Mark and I have decided to escape the kids the house the dog the renovation and the crushing weight of responsibility for 24 hours to visit the nation's capital and I don't wanna say I gave him a pity invite cause my plus 1 fell through but also my plus 1 did fall through and Mark seemed like the next logical option right so we landed headed to the QT in Wellington lined our stomachs cause we're both in our 30s and then it was time to get ready I had an idea in my head about how this was glam was gonna go but at the time doing it I was stressing but we finally made it to the premiere of World of Wearable Arts and I can't with how this man scrubbed up and even though WOW has been on my bucket list for years and years I had no idea what to expect obviously we can't film the actual show but before it began we were able to interact with some of the costumes and performers from previous years and it was a spectacle I'll tell you that much and I lost my sh*t a little bit when a lady dressed the chicest of chic beekeepers came up and handed me a present because apparently the dreammakers like my outfit then it was time for the show to begin and honestly it was unbelievable the visual storytelling the performance the music the atmosphere just the whole experience was insane we did some press after then it was straight back to the hotel cause I really wanted to find out what was inside this thing it was a puzzle and tickets for next year's show and I'm already excited then I tackled a pile of nachos and don't worry I took off the dress I just wanted to feel like a brat for a sec
