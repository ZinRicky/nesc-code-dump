Today is my husband's 40th birthday and I wanted to surprise him with an Oreo cookie chocolate pie since Oreos are his favourite, so that's what I did. Obviously I needed to fuel myself with a smoothie lunch and use this opportunity to take my animal based prenatal vitamins. Love that these have real ingredients from the land like regeneratively farmed beef liver, so I can trust I'm preparing my body for optimal fertility. I started by making my Oreo cookie crust. I only sweeten this cookie crust with 1/4 cup of low glycemic coconut sugar and then I rolled it out as thin as I could between two sheets of Parchment paper. While that baked, I made some chocolate from scratch from my chocolate pie filling. I made one bar and left the remaining 7 ounces in liquid form. After whipping up some raw cream, I got to making the rest of the filling. I whisked this over a double broiler until it reached 160 degrees. While that cooled, I crumbled up the Oreo cookie into Oreo crumbs to create a cookie pie crust. I used the back of a measuring cup to shape a huge amount of the crumbs into a pie dish since I really love a big crust and hate when they're skimpy. I baked the crust for 20 minutes finished the filling by whipping my chocolate mixture with creamed butter and then folding in the whipped cream. The final pie came together in just A few minutes and I finished by shaving the homemade chocolate bar with a vegetable peeler for the final pie decoration. My husband was obsessed.
