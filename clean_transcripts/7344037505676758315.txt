a lot of women commented on the little skit that I did like oh I can't believe I did that blah blah blah like this do not beat yourself up it's not your fault when you get involved with somebody like that they fucking manipulated you they used their children as a fucking tool to get you to use your heart and empathy and be there you what you did what you thought was a good thing then in Hindsay you're able to look back and say gosh that was silly I shouldn't have done that I don't know why I participated in that way so you have growth so don't beat yourself up over something you did in the past because that's not gonna serve you in the future and all you can do is just be a vocal voice to help women never make that mistake again so thank you for adding to the conversation thank you for validating that yes there are women that gets trapped in these relationships and pay their child support and none of them are stupid they're being abused
