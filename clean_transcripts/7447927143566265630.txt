every week I make my husband watch the New Heights podcast with me and every week continuously he said I'm jealous of Travis because of his accelerator drink fridge so for Christmas I got my husband his own accelerator drink fridge I ordered one case of every flavor so he's got a whole lot of accelerators and I think this refrigerator holds 120 cans so let's stock it it is finished and beautiful I had a bunch leftover so I stocked them down here for him and this is his Christmas gift but boxes are still a man's job so I'm gonna leave those for him and he'll get to see his refrigerator and break those down Merry Christmas love
