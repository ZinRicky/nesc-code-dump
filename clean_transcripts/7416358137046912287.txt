okay the stitches are off but go watch this video from nowthis impact of Lawrence O'Donnell on MSNBC talking about Amber Thurman Amber Thurman if you haven't heard was a 28 year old Georgia woman who had a 6 year old son who was essentially killed by the state because she was denied a D&C or dilation and curettage and it would have saved her life and she was not able to have this procedure because Georgia's abortion ban makes a D&C punishable as a felony doctors can be charged with a felony for performing this life saving procedure that Lawrence O'Donnell says his mother had before Roe v Wade before abortion was even legal Laurence O'Donnell's mother was allowed to have a D&C following a miscarriage and it saved her life which means that in the year 2024 there are parts of this country where women are more at risk are more in danger than they were before Roe v Wade before abortion was legal so obviously we live in a country where it is dangerous to be pregnant in any context in any circumstance it is dangerous to be pregnant or even to be able to become pregnant the Republicans pushed and passed the anti abortion laws the Democrats stood by and let it happen Joe Biden could have codified Roe v Wade and he did not and um now there are women who are dying women like Amber Thurman who have you know a child to take care of and also women who want to continue the pregnancies that they miscarry um and then are denied the proper care following that miscarriage those women are dying because they wanted to have a child and then a miscarriage that was completely outside of their control happened and now the state is is killing these women and it's not because the politicians think they know better it's not because they you know think they understand like what is best for women they understand that these laws kill women they know that they're willing to sacrifice women they're willing to sacrifice mothers they're willing to turn children into motherless children all to serve this purpose of forcing more people to have children that they don't necessarily want to have um forcing people into poverty as a result of raising children creating the next working class workforce and forcing women back into servitude by forcing them into motherhood and wifehood and it's just it's grim it's really grim
