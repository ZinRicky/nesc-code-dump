Mila Kunas has allegedly moved out of the home she shares another day another celebrity listed in conjunction with the P Diddy case why do men continue to cover up and protect each other even and especially when it involves cases of horrific violence against women Doctor Zoe and I wanna talk about how and why men use and rely on one another to cover up violence against women so Dominic Pelicot over in France has played guilty to drugging and graping his wife over a period of 10 years inviting facilitating over the internet random men to come over and her obviously the acts are horrendous but I think what's really struck a cord with people is the silent and complicity of all of the men however many there were none of which spoke up none of which who reported him or said anything in order for this abuse to continue over 10 years this kind of mutual silence this agreed upon code was relied upon between these men and it's not that different from what's happening here this case has also raised questions about how men use this abuse of power to ensure that they create a network of silence and shame from their survivors to continue to perpetrate abuse they develop these networks of power and influence in order to evade accountability for their actions in order to continue to perpetrate we've seen so many stories come to light about how different celebrities and people with wealth and people with influence have been involved or roped in to this network and somehow most of them have been silenced last week the research came out that nearly one in 10 men in New South Wales have faced legal action over domestic or family violence those are just the ones that have faced legal action one in 10 we know that the same amount of Australian men have had with under eighteens we also know that research that found that one in three men would if they knew that there were no consequences to their actions which again explains things like this and cases like this men not only commit these acts but depend on the silence and complicity of other men to do so the more wealthy connected and powerful they are the more effectively they can do this all men benefit from the system of silence this is why survivors struggle to get justice and if you think this doesn't affect you ask yourself how many men do you think are in your community who are staying silent in order to allow other men to continue to perpetrate
