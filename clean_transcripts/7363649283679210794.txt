so there was a really interesting video made by White Woman Whisper I tried to stitch it and the audio didn't record so I'm gonna try to record it again here tag her below because you should go watch her video but she basically poses the question or opens up this discussion this bear verse man discussion to black women in asking okay if you're in an office who would you rather walk in a white man or a white woman and that she said that the collective answer would be a white man and a lot of women are getting offended a lot of white women are getting offended because they're like oh my gosh what a man could do to you is so much worse than a woman like this is this is divisive but like you're not getting it the reason why black women would choose a white man over a white woman is for the same reason that women as a collective especially white women which is the bearer over the man it is the danger you know versus the danger you don't and like historically the under the surface racism that white women have for black women has caused death and destruction and is absolutely a humongous danger because black women know like in our society that a white woman's accounting of things will always be taken more seriously than a black woman's so she has to have like a distance because of personal safety now I've seen this play out in my real life I live in the south I go to a lot of like influencer functions with like large groups of people and I can see the difference between women of color who know me and women of color who don't and how they interact with me and like the guard that they have up and that's not offensive to me because it's common sense I absolutely expect them to be apprehensive of a white woman in the south because they don't know what they're getting but just as the whole point of the bear versus man conversation is to make men understand that women are innately apprehensive and cautious around all men the question that white woman whisper was posing is to make white women understand the cautiousness that black women have around white women that sort of like being scared of me before I give them a reason not to is not offensive to me because it is absolutely my responsibility to prove to these women that I am a safe person not the other way around you cannot like bully someone into trusting you with their personal safety and that's a lesson for the men on the bare conversation too
