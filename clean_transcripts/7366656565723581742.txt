We know nothing. We don't know his name. We don't know what he looks like. We don't know anything about it. It's true. This is so odd. It's very black cat, golden retriever. Fully pink. Liz read one comment that said that and has really, like, really stuck to this. Yeah, black cat, golden retriever thing. But that's what a black cat would say. Like, you're. You being annoyed? It sounds racist. No. We're gonna have so much fun. We're probably gonna be together. I have parts, but some of my worst parts come out when I'm with you. In a safe way. Like in a sisterly way.
