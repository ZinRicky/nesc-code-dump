so I may be a content creator but sometimes I watch these videos and I realise how dumb I am at how other people film their content because the whole time people have been filming their car and they have like like this angle and they're like talking to you I just kind of assumed they were propping it on their car I was wrong they have one of these guys so I'm gonna try and set one up and see if we can make some fun like chat in the car content because school started again and the activities have started again and I'm gonna be spending a lot of time in this car myself enjoy now admittedly I am not a gadget friendly person so this looks like it's gonna stick onto something curious not sure what these are for yet the little ball socket things never really work for me so I we're we're gonna see if I can actually get this to like stay there alright it's in the ball is in the suction cup thing interesting oh my god that moves it goes in and out now I've got to figure out where to stick it because it says it can stick um but only to a flat surface okay I committed I put it up there I think I hate it this is so fancy oh my god we can chat now um I don't like how it looks in my car but I think this will be really helpful to do like hands free car videos and for like when I'm map questing map questing GPS like Apple Maps looking for where I'm going because then I can look and not have to like look down because I usually keep it in here with my cup holders and stuff it's very dangerous um so this might be better okay we have elevated I'm excited
