so many people dislike or hate old people now why is that I have personally never found an old person/older person that I dislike I think they are the sweetest nicest people ever they have wisdom, smart they're just wholesome and pure why why are we disliking old people why why do we call them boomers Why are we so mean to them I just went to the post office to send off a letter I had the sweetest old man help me who's so kind and so genuine it just made my day he just had such a good attitude so I don't know just remember guys Theyâ€™re somebody's grandpa somebody's grandma, mom, sister, brother we all need to respect older people and stop calling them boomers stop disliking them, they're just like you and I except they might be cooler actually
