so my daughter said something to me in the car that literally stopped me in my tracks and broke my heart a little bit we were talking about tantrums and yelling especially as it like correlates to adults yelling at their kid because that's like a cycle I'm breaking so I was talking about how sometimes grown UPS yell at kids my daughter was so confused about the fact that sometimes grown UPS yell at kids because she doesn't see it in our house she was like I didn't know grown UPS yelled at kids that was nice but that wasn't the thing I'm trying to tell you about talked about how I'm teaching them coping mechanisms to deal with their big feelings so they don't have giant outbursts as an adult so they have better emotional regulation and can control their feelings a little bit better and handle them when they become grown UPS and that that takes practice and somehow in the conversation it came out that like I got yelled at as a kid at the general parenting back then was either to yell at your kid or send them to timeout and my daughter looked up and she is such an introspective child she said that's not okay so your mom and dad put their bad feelings on you fuck girl and there's a reason I'm so fucked up gonna think about that all day
