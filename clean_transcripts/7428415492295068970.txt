I once prayed, Lord, use me for something great as mom. As I'm sure that you all can relate, our days on this earth are short and few, and to give them our all is what we all strive to do. Yet he showed me a great work that seems so small and simple to me. Loving my children and serving my family. How can this be? I asked with respect. Washing the dishes and doing the clothes. This isn't something so important that I would have chose.
