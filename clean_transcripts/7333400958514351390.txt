I can't express how disabling ADHD is my brain literally does not work right I have been so like depressed and rotting for weeks my apartment has been a mess I've just been feeling like so shitty first I had a friend visiting so I had to like clean the depression nest and I took a Vyvanse today so that I can clean not only is my apartment clean but I'm also doing like that my bags my ADHD bag like my several bags like have things thrown in them for a different time to deal with and you don't remember what's in there cause like if you don't see it doesn't exist so then you just have like several bags of things I'm dealing with my ADHD bags just because and it's just a sharp reminder that like if my brain worked I wouldn't be the way that I am like I'm not just an inherently lazy person like there is something wrong with me and a little fucking pill can fix it but I haven't been able to get my medication for 2 months over 2 months because of the vyvanse shortage so I'm just using the pills like when I need them but I just can't imagine what my life would be like if I could just operate like this all the time
