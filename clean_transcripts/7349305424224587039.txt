I put this on like literally five minutes ago why is it bleeding already like right there I want nothing more than to be a lip liner and gloss girl but every time I wear lip liner and gloss that like it just it ends up bleeding and it'll bleed more and I'm not like using bad products I'm using the Fenty I use this Pat Mcgrath eye pencil and line my lips and then I use this like Brown Nyx shade phenomenal lip liner by the way and I use that like as a transition and like I feel like these are all very good quality products but nothing I do will make my like liner and gloss stay so please tell me what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it thank you
