hi guys I'm Victoria lit and I suffer from TWD TWD is well the medical terms for it is traditional wife disease it's been dormant from a young age and the prognosis for this probably originated from my traditional Latina mother so basically what TWD is when you're married or with you're with a man you cook, clean, do his laundry, do everything for him. basically you just wanna do anything to please him. a lot of women actually suffer from this disease, and it goes undiagnosed because they haven't found a good man yet. so they don't even realize they have it now this disease scares most women um they're terrified of contracting it it's understandable because they think that it's enslavement when actually it's enrichment in your life it's actually a gift so I just wanted to kind of be a spokesperson for someone who suffers with TWD and just you know tell you that you're not alone in this we're in this together first example of how I knew I had trad wife disease was that when I first met him I had these butterflies in my stomach and I automatically just wanted to do anything to please him. it was a huge tell, of how I knew I had this disease I started cooking for him, cleaning for him, doing all his laundry, doing anything to make him happy! which was kind of crazy, because I didn't think I'd ever do this for a man. but that was a huge tell another example is, if he mentioned something in passing that he liked once I would automatically store that in my memory I would either make whatever he said he liked or prepare anything I would just do whatever he liked that was huge that was kind of crazy the last sign of how I knew I had TRAD wife disease was that. Any time I was with my man I would just, my brain would turn off. like I would just my brain turned off that was scary at first, I didn't know what to do! but you know, after learning the signs and symptoms of tradwife disease I learned that, that's actually a good thing because he provides so much for me, that he leads for me So I don't have to use my brain I can just turn it off and that's actually a gift in itself so don't be scared if you suffer from tradwife disease I'm here with you we can get through this
