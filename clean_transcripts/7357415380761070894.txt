so while a lot of my content I'm usually trying to like empower women to leave and be like you don't have to stay blah blah blah like you can leave whatever um the reason why my content will be inconsistent or like I've had a podcast for years but you know still don't have that many episodes is because these are the things I deal with behind the scenes that I kinda don't share a lot about I don't really know why I know why I never want someone to be discouraged to leave seeing how hard it is you know what I mean like I don't want women to be like oh my god Child Protective Services cause I remember when I was um married and like a stay at home mom that was my worst nightmare like I was like next to having a child that had a life threatening illness and needed like open heart surgery right away my next worst fear was my children being the subject of some sort of investigation and like at risk of your parenting rights being like dangled do you know what I mean of course that's terrifying so I don't know I guess I should share more about it because it's not as scary as I thought it was so I guess that's what I was doing I just really need some people are like wow what
