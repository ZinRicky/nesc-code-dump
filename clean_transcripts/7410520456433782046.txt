every family is different and that means every homeschool is gonna be different too the beauty of homeschooling is that you get to do whatever works for your family and of all the homeschool families you see online no two are gonna be exactly the same sure you might have the same resources or curriculum as someone else but how you use them is totally unique to you our child it's why I started sharing our homeschooling journey but also why I started following other homeschool I truly love seeing and learning what other people are using in their homeschool my areas of weakness are someone else's strength and there's so much value in watching and learning what they're doing I am really good at creating hands on lessons especially for math and reading but I am terrible at history art and music so I tend to follow people who are posting that kind of content because when I follow them I'm learning from them and I'm strengthening my weaknesses
