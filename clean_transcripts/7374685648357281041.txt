have you ever just looked at an old knob and thought wow, that's filthy cause I looked at about six of them today and concluded that they all needed a really good rub to bring them back to their former glory Weâ€™re renovating our 68 year old home and from what I can tell these are the original knobs we've got them all throughout the house but these six have been taken from the lounge which is one of many rooms that we're currently working and somebody commented recently and asked if I was gonna get some new handles for the cupboards but I thought no I just wanna rub these old knobs for a while and see what happens and what happened was fkn magical if you ask me I'm using bar keepers friend cause that's what TikTok research told me to do a scrub mummy and a little bit of water and I'm working with the theory that they may be brass because they're heavy and they're solid but they're not magnetic but if you know what else they could be please feel free to let me know by the way I'm just cautiously hopeful that this is the right way to treat them I did 2 rounds on each with the barkeepers friend cause you're not supposed to leave that stuff on there for more than a minute and I was trying to scrub them so gently so it's not to leave any scratches then I used some metal polish which we've had lying around for years and just when I thought these things were clean more stuff kept coming off the one on the rights been polished the one on the left hasn't and before long we were done and honestly I couldn't believe my luck they look brand new quick reminder of where we started the knobs look dark and lacklustre and now what do you reckon about that?! I love them six down and only 35 more to go
