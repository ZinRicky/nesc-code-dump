I don't mean to shock anyone but we moved into this house a year ago and I absolutely love her she's like an elegant old lady albeit a bit of a run down one so everyday since move in day I spent my time attempting to restore her and I've been thinking about how to refresh the kitchen and I concluded that the bones are good I just need to change literally everything else so then I fell in love with this Elysian Pull Out tap from ABI Interiors I love the shape I've always wanted a pullout tap and this one even comes with a sensor which I'll show you once it's installed and if you know me you know I've been pining after the white sink I had at my old house so picking ABIâ€™s Vienna single sink in the white granite was just a no brainer for me shes stain, scratch, heat and impact resistant and just bloody beautiful and for all the metals throughout the whole house I'm going for brushed copper because it's giving heritage but it was a difficult decision because ABI have 8 beautiful colours to choose from so go check them out
