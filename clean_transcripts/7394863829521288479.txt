my husband does not want me to work now before you get your panties in a bunch it's not saying that I can't work but he would just prefer me not work in fact I have actually worked off and on throughout our whole marriage but before we even got married I knew that it was his desire to work hard and be the provider and me to stay home with the kid we very much believe in the traditional biblical roles of man and wife in a marriage so he goes off and works hard all day long and I stay home take care of a house and raise our children now that might not work for everybody and you might not like it but it works for us and we're okay with it
