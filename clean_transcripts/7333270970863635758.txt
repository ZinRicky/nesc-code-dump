I Learned this literally in therapy as women because I went to therapy that was based in power and control and that's all we talked about wasn't really feelings it wasn't how sad are you today it wasn't let's figure things out you know in third grade what did your mom say to you that wasn't the therapy it was power and control where do you give up your power where can you take back some more control what's going on in your life you have to I had to acknowledge you are giving up a lot of your power we are participating in these relationships and you have to look within that's where a lot of the like love yourself comes from because you don't even love yourself you're hoping somebody else externally will give you love and validation and then you'll feel happy and that's not how it works that's backwards you need to love yourself and appreciate yourself and value yourself and know your fucking worth and that's how you don't get into these situations it's when you look you see yourself so low so much lower than everybody else oh I'm so sorry I'm sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I'm so you're so meek and small and always trying to shrink and and adjust to everybody else and stay out of the way and just be good and be kind and be nice I mean just like the scene from Barbie and so since you see yourself as lower than everybody else you're just gonna you know kinda fall for anything and when you have this person that's like think so highly of themself they come along and they can see your weakness and that's how think those two people become such a perfect match and that's how come you're gonna stay because as long as you're needing external validation that person knows how much power and control they have over you because your whole self worth is based in when they give it to you you are dependent on them you you have no identity outside of them it's their love it's their comfort you can't feel better after this argument until we talk about it and I feel better because they are what give you everything so until you can start to see yourself as a human like everybody else that deserves respect and until you start to like love yourself and take care of yourself you stay stuck in these fucking ugly cycles
