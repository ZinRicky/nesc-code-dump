Cash strapped consumers should eat cereal for dinner to save money. At least that's what the CEO of Kellogg said last week on CNBC. And if consuming chicken for dinner, family should consume frosted flakes or frosted mini hearts as the rising prices at the grocery stores are being felt nationwide. And let me be very honest, the rising prices at the grocery are definitely being felt. My bills have never been so high, but that doesn't mean I'm going to the cereal aisle where there's a bunch of bioengineered, chemical laid and refined sugar doused, fifasate sprayed wheat, corn, and soy products. I'm making my money stretch by loading up my freezer with 100% grass fed ground beef, stewing meat, bulk grains and flour, and in seasoned vegetables. And FYI, a 10.9 ounce box of frosted Flakes is 6 79 versus 5 10 for the same amount of organic 100% grass fed ground beef. Like, are you kidding me, Gary?
