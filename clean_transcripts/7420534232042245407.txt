Here is the link one more time for anybody who's interested in the cute little color from cardigan that I always wear. It is truly like wearing somebody's little crochet blanket. It is snuggly, it's delicious. Everyone that I know that has purchased one has been like, you were right. I fucking love it. So if you think you would love it, I guarantee you will. Also, I'm 5 9 and it's long, so you can trim it if you need to at the bottom because it's for me, even a little bit long. So it's linked right here if you want one.
