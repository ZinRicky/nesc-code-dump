You know what I find especially funny about the man versus bear debate is when women pick bear, all of a sudden all bears are a danger. And when we're like, but not all bears. Not all bears. Not every fucking bear is gonna eat me. I've been in the woods. Bears live in the fucking woods. I've been in the woods with bears before and not gotten mauled. Okay? But it's so funny that when we talk about men and wanna talk about the men that assault us and hurt us and abuse us, not all men, not all men. Not all men, okay? But let's keep that not all energy when it comes to the fucking bear. Not all fucking bears. Bear all fucking day.
