I was so nervous when I started dating this guy that I like we've been dating now for over a year I was so nervous when I started dating him because he had four kids like he was fine with it but then I was like oh my god what about when he still tells his family what if they're like oh my god you're crazy like what are you doing blah blah blah like some of the shit you do hear people say about single moms um his mom just sent my kids each one of my children all four of them a little Easter card with $10 inside for all of them so needless to say it is not the end of the world to leave your marriage and start over because there are lots of beautiful people in this world that you know see you for more than a single mom and see your children as more than a burden and they're willing to welcome you and love you and that's way better than being in a toxic marriage
