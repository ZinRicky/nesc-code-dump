How is courtship different from dating so commonly? Dating does not usually have marriage in mind, but it's usually very recreational. People will date for years without getting engaged, or they'll date multiple people, etc. Most of the time casual dating leads to hookups as well. It tends to be very emotionally based and infatuation is usually the factor that leads people to date. Intentional dating is different from casual dating. Intentional dating is what most Christians do. Marriage is the end goal and the couple spends the time getting to know each other more seriously while dating each other, but often date for a short amount of time before getting married and there will usually be agreed upon physical boundaries. Courtship is different from both of these. Courtship is usually more family centered. The couple is often set up by the parents and often doesn't go on dates. For me we spent most of our time together hanging out at my parents house. The couple does go on dates, so usually chaperone. The couple usually does not spend um time alone together before engagement for accountability purposes. There's usually stricter physical boundaries. For example, my husband and I didn't touch until we were engaged. There's also greater emphasis on getting to know each other. I'm on a deep level then spending time going on dates. Most of our courtship we spent emailing each other back and forth about our beliefs on theology, marriage, the family, etc. Decisions are made Logically. And there is very little emphasis on the romantic side of things before engagement, so do not skew decisions. There's a summary in the caption, but once again, let me know your questions and I'll do my best to answer soon.
