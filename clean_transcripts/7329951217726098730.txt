one of my favourite things about homeschooling is our ability to incorporate travel and experiences into our homeschool learning so what does that look like it looks like learning about dolphin ecology and biology while getting to touch and interact with dolphins up close and personal in Mexico the kids were curious and they were able to ask questions to the handler about dolphins life inside and out of the enclosures we also got to get up close and personal with manatees learning about these gentle creatures feeding them and getting to learn all about their lives did you know that they're closely related to elephants and they actually feel pretty slimy on the day we went to Ishka at Eco Park in Playa del Carmen we got to go through an entire aquarium learning about the coral reef system interacting with local wildlife and diving headfirst into ancient Maya culture I had actually prepped the kids for this trip by doing a Mesoamerica an ancient Mayan unit study before we even got there so once we got to Mexico they were just reinforcing all of the things that we had read about in books and seeing some of these cultural practices up close and some of these actual structures up close just solidified that learning is best through doing it's one thing to learn what an ancient Mayan temple looks like through a book it's another one to be standing right next to one and the ability to ask questions to the people who live here who know these animals this ecology this history who lived this culture day to day was invaluable learning experiences that I couldn't possibly have provided simply being at home with our homeschool journey my favourite thing and the thing that I focus on the most is about taking our classroom on the road learning through experiences no it's not possible to take big trips like this all the time but there's so many resources available in our local communities as well historical sites museums and nature preserves are great resources for homeschool learning our kids got to ask questions pick up coral and we even set aside time to do a Mayan zodiac art class in the house all of this was learning and these counted as learning days and my kids are the better for it
