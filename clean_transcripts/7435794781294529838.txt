yeah so in a patriarchy women are subordinate to men and what I'm saying is that misogyny is not this phenomenon whereby an individual hates all women as I explained in my last video that definition is really useless and counterproductive because virtually no one will meet that definition but if we understand misogyny as a political phenomenon whereby individuals utilize social control to continue to subordinate women and uphold male dominance then everything you're saying here fits neatly in that model what I mean by social control is that patriarchal and misogynistic forces will reward women who are being good girls and who are abiding by patriarchal social norms and it will deter and be hostile towards women who disrupt that or do not conform but like misogynists are deterring women from stepping out of bounds from their gendered norms in terms of labor by for example with reproductive labor women who do not freely and happily do reproductive labor are typically labeled as sluts or being selfish being overly career driven are trying to use social stigma as a method of social control when I'm looking at my vote in terms of the 2024 elections Trump frequently called young women who were concerned about abortion rights as being dumb as being stupid these stupid college girl one that really sticks out to me is when Elon Musk went on Twitter to threaten Taylor Swift with SA after she dared you come out in support of Harris/Walz  but elements of social control of course involves the law so the right is threatening women who have abortions with prison time doctors who help women prison time referring to women 25% of women who have had abortions as murderers again the social stigma he smiled at so street harassment may be utilized to try to remind and assert to women that you owe men your attention and your time the examples are endless um misogyny tries to reward good girls and punish bad girls and it's not just punishing when you're a bad girl but it's ensuring that women know that if you step out of line you may face hostility so there's like that threat element of it as well I will pause there because I could talk about this forever so let me know your thoughts and questions in the comments
