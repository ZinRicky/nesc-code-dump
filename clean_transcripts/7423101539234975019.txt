I had really high hopes for this being a normal week we're all moved in semi settled so I thought maybe we'd start getting back into a normal routine but it's Hurricane season and we live on the west coast of Florida which means we are getting prepared for Hurricane melting two major hurricanes in two weeks is too too many and this one is giving Ian vibes that I'm really not a fan of the thing about these storms is you never know where it's gonna hit until the last minute right now the eye is supposed to be heading north of us but it's slowly moving south which means we could end up getting a direct hit but either way the south side of this Hurricane is supposed to have a lot of storm surge either way we're looking at a massive a whole lot of water so we did pack a snack bag for ourselves in case we lose power and have to go to Gaga and Papas their house is the place to be during a Hurricane because they have a whole home generator and they never lose power depending on what this storm is that might be where we end up
