No. 1 have dinner ready on the table never let your man go hungry the way to a man's heart truly is through their stomach so make sure you cook for them and make sure they're not hungry No. Two take care of yourself meaning don't let yourself go okay the guy fell in love with that's who he wants! pick yourself up make sure you shower brush your hair just make sure your appearance is pleasant and nice so we're humans you don't have to do this all the time obviously typically you wanna be his breath of fresh air be happy and excited to see him been at work all day stressed out the last thing he wants to do is come home to a grumpy or sad wife or tidy up the house okay I know shouldn't be all on you the tour should be shared but if you want your man to come home to you and be happy make it a good environment for him to come home to No. 5 don't complain too much Don't be drama your man wants to come home to you or time when you're out to brunch with them men don't want that they wanna enjoy you and your pleasantness I'm not saying you have to do these things I'm just saying it works believe me or not I don't care
