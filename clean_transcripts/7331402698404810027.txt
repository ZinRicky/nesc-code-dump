I think one of the hardest things about learning how to gentle parent is how your perspective shifts like I can now see my own actions through the perspective of both the parent and the child and I think that's where a lot of disconnect between millennials and Gen Z and their Boomer or Gen X parents comes from because I think that generation of parents only sees their actions through the lens of parental viewpoint every action they did is justifiable but in reality if you can see both perspectives you can see not only the reasons behind your actions but also the impact that it had on the child it doesn't matter to the child if they were being annoying or disrespectful all they will remember is how you made them feel in that moment which is why when I mess up when I overreact when I discipline my children in a way that doesn't align with the way that I want them to feel I beat myself up 10 times over because I can feel what it would feel like to be the child in that situation and I think being able to hold both of those perspectives is the key to consciously parenting
