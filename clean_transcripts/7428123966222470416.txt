we've just doubled the size of our garden and by the ‘we’ I mean I gently bullied my husband into building me two more planted boxes but with the weather warming up and the long weekend incoming I did feel that intense of urgency because if I don't get the plants on the ground like now then we won't be enjoying their beautiful produce all summer long and a little birdie told me that The Warehouse has an incredible selection of garden supplies including the healthiest little seedlings at every day low priced  so today I went to investigate and it turns out the bird actually did have the authority on the word because I found some great bargains including these ginormous tomato plants for only $10 which I've seen literally double the price elsewhere recently I raced home and was so excited to get immediately stuck in and I don't know what it is about the garden but it's definitely one of my happy places Mixed through some compost rush was a steal at only $5.50 a bag I planted a few varieties of peas before getting started on my strawberry patch and I’m really looking forward to coming out here and picking strawberries with the kids once they start ripening  I’m gonna train a couple of varieties of courgettes up and over these trellises I did half a dozen more peas before thinning my tomato plants so they can focus more energy in on the fruit then I planted a raspberry and a rhubarb but I'm telling you I can just about taste the Christmas crumble I put in a dozen lettuces from two variety packs so they’re all different types which is perfect cos we’re definitely big salad people and I finished up by planting my agria seed potatoes Which in about 90 days should be ready to harvest Now is definitely the time to be planting your summer garden and The Warehouse has a great range if you’re on the hunt
