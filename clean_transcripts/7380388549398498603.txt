“You should know what I want without me having to ask” probably said it or you've probably had it told to you But that kind of falls under the Assumption that your partner is a mind reader As far as I know no one can do or no one is a mind reader They just can't, that's just not how humans work maybe with advanced technology and AI one day that could be a possibility but as of right now it's not possible if you want your partner to do a specific thing for you You have to lay it out for them you have to explain to them and communicate that's why if you want your partner to do something you have to ask for it not only is it okay to ask you have to ask more than half the time because we are not AI they can't read your mind The way everyone learns is through communication saying hey I'd really like if you took out the garbage before it got overfilled hey, I'd like if you cooked my favorite meal for me every once in a while to surprise me or hey spending one on one time together is really important to me I'd like if we did more of that whatever it is you have to be willing to lay it out for them You have to be willing to open up and express your desires directly Then you can actually often get to a place where it's like yeah I know what you want and you know without me explaining but it doesn't start there anybody who is there probably started with a ton of communicate about what they need from each other it's as simple as that communication
