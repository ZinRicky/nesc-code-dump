Here's how I get the very most out of my Olaplex. This is for the number three, and this is something that a hairdresser told me not that long ago. Game changer. I start with slightly damp hair. I washed it with shampoo, but I did not use any conditioner. Section it a little bit. For the bottom parts, I'm not gonna use very much, like, literally that much. Then for these sections up here, I use a little bit more that much. Pretty saturated in the Olaplex. I'm going to take a butterfly clip, we're gonna clip it up, and I'm gonna use one of these plastic hair caps to really keep the moisture in there. So cute. Then I like to just put a scarf over all of it. I will go clean the house, homeschool the kids, laundry, get started on dinner. I will just let this sit several hours. The bottle says to let it sit for 10 minutes. I honestly think they're just trying to get you to buy more bottles, because it continues to work long after 10 minutes. As long as your hair is a little bit wet, it'll continue to work. At least that's what my hairdresser told me. So that's what I've been doing, and I love it. I've used this stuff for years, and this is hands down the best way to get the most bang for your bug.
