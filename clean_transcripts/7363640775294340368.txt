they will then say that you are the person who's actually physically abusive it causes long term psychological difficulties blame and accountability away from the perpetrator and towards the victim so rapists that is or those accused of rape or even in friendship so it stands for deny and social workers and first responders to all be trained in Davo and as I kind of mentioned before that you don't know what's going on so yeah I hope that um they'll accuse you of cheating you need help things like that and then position themselves as a victim to what you did they portray the victim as the offender kind of question your own narrative and your own version of what's going on um you might just see it happening like in the media isn't happening and B oh well we had a difference of opinion or oh well one time he said one thing they will attack your credibility it also has social and legal implications where it can be processes really skewed and difficult it can be threatening hit back in defence at one point where there's no physical evidence or any witnesses so perpetrators start with denying the harm that they caused and sometimes perpetrators will even get sympathy and support from others so it is really effective but they don't stop there so say you left or you went and start another relationship the goal of this part of Davo they will attack like who you are as a person your character your motives V O is it me is it me like it's a process that goes on for a long time this helps in some way someone the reversal makes it very confusing for authorities like say that you've got some other motives going on that you might not have you can see it when people are using it against you a lot of the time really confused about what's happening because you're being told this a the I guess mental well being of the victim you might wanna know that this happens so that you can know even if what you did was a retaliation to the months or they then move on to attacking the victim who's tryna hold them to account because they need to know what it is for victims for future victims to really explain the behaviour of perpetrators and first respondents to understand who the actual victim is so once you understand it and that's why I'm telling you about it now because for survivors this might be happening to your friends so they reverse the role they will cling on to one tiny thing you did women who are the victims which is why a lot of the time Davo will end up with making the victim feel completely isolated have you ever heard of DARVO d a R where you're like actually invented it in the 1990s this attack can be verbal or physical or otherwise you might see it happening in the workplace they will attack any aspect of you that they can and completely powerless cause you're always gonna have that voice in your head saying because of this tactic so Dava is a form of gaslighting they will attack your sanity when they were caught in wrongdoing basically um and it often is really effective because 97% of perpetrators are never jailed they might flat out deny and say like that never happened this is designed to shift and then the third step reverse victim offender are often put in a position where they're then accused of being perpetrators because I think it's a really important tool to have and then they'll say that you are the perpetrator of cheating it's actually this kind of really solid structure that actually goes on for we see that a lot of the time when perpetrators are accused so we can see how this can really start to unravel the um they also want to make you as a victim you might have experienced this so it's like she's crazy is a classic Davo tactic years of abuse that they were putting on you you know but it wasn't as bad as they say it is is to really make sure that no one believes or takes the victim seriously that's when they lash out the most so that they can recognise when it's happening say you actually you know David can very much be used in the context of an abusive relationship cycle that you've lost your mind because it's also used in so many other ways it can make legal um or then they might start to say like so this psychologist called Jennifer Fraid um to identify it this can obviously be really effective that's when the perpetrator starts to portray themselves as the victim understand that's why it's really important for lawyers you're starting to be told that you're of bad character so that you feel more and more confused about your own reality that's why we don't just use gaslighting to say they might refrain from seeking justice or asking for help whether it's like in the workplace or in relationships or in dating attack and reverse victim offender any little toolkit for understanding abusers behaviour
