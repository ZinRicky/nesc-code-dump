What is your one liner? As a parent that eats every time you get to use it in our house, I have a few of these, but my favorite one that I say is, don't yuck someone else's yum. Like, you can like what you like. You can think what somebody else likes is disgusting, but you keep that to yourself. You don't yuck somebody else's yum. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not likable.
