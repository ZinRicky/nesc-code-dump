I don't think people realize how bad the devastation and the life loss is gonna be in western North Carolina for a while most people didn't evacuate there was no evacuation order they weren't ready for this and now they are stranded I've been seeing reports of people on mountain tops calling them mountain islands because they can't get down cause the roads are roaded away the only lucky thing is that people in southern Appalachia are resourceful and they help their neighbors and they have a lot of like skills so prepping food preservation I just some of the towns me and my family visited many times are just completely gone it is just a resting this feeling of like shock and helplessness in the meantime it is like a sunny beautiful day in Charleston it just seems so bizarre for them to have gone Hurricane and not us like it's just this is bad and this is it's gonna be worse than we think
