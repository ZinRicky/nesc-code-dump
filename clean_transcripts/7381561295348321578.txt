My husband's about to go on a 25 hour road trip, so I decided to make him some bubblegum lollipops as a little treat on his drive. Started out by making my bubblegum by spreading some powdered sugar on some wax paper, melting down my gum base, transferring that into the middle of my mounts I created. I added some apple flavor to one of them and added some vanilla extract to the other to make two different kinds of flavors before kneading in my powdered sugar. Once a good portion of them was absorbed, I cut them up and formed them into little gumballs before putting them aside while I got started on making my lollipops. Obviously had to try one and make sure that it was the right consistency, which it was. Then moved on to making my lollipops by combining some sugar and syrup in a pot before placing that on my stove to boil. In the meantime, I put my gumballs on top of my lollipop sticks before checking on my sugar mixture on the stove. Wanted to keep a close eye on it to make sure it reached the right temperature for adding in some more apple syrup and green food colouring since I was making apple flavoured lollipops. Once it reached the hard crack stage, I transferred it over to my silicone molds before placing my lollipop sticks inside. Speed up the cooling process. I placed them in the fridge and then had lucky Get them out of the molds, because I couldn't, for some reason. Got them out and couldn't contain his excitement. So he tried one of them and absolutely love them. Wrapped up the other one so he could take them on his road trip.
