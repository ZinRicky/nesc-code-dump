I barely slept last night because I was so nervous about this hourglass Barney's meet and greet that I was doing, but you guys showed up, and this made my week. I started glam pretty early. I always have to use my hourglass concealer. The ones that have been around for a while know how much I love it. All the rest of my touch UPS, and then it was time to finish putting on my outfit. I was so excited to get this on that I ripped the zipper, so my tailor had to come over and literally sew me into my dress, put the skirt over, got it all snug, then I realized how late we were, so we grabbed the kids and started getting into the cars. Getting two toddlers and a baby into a car as a task, but we managed. And then headed over to the pop up. I had some time to walk around the store, look at all the hourglass makeup, look at all the amazing designers that were showing in the space. I also tried all the snacks and drinks that Fred's made before heading out to meet all of you. I can't believe how many of you guys came. I love chatting with you guys, answering questions, just hanging out and getting to know all of you. I can't believe how far some of you guys traveled, and I couldn't be more grateful. This was such a magical experience that I Couldn't stop crying on the way back to the hotel.
