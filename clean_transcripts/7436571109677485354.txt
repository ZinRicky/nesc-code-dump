understand that when I use the term misogyny I'm not referring to subjectively hating women what I'm referring to when I use that term attempts to control and police women's behavior and men's behavior in a way that reinforces the patriarchy and women's subordination but let's look at some examples so they really honed in on messaging that women who do not have children are unlikable unfit for leadership positions and morally bankrupt by a bunch of childless cat ladies Kamala Harris doesn't have anything keeping her humble or evil you're practicing child sacrifice and that is exactly what they're doing killing your child that's no different than the Canaanites arguing that the law should be used as a mechanism to ensure that women reproduce even without their consent it has to be some form of punishment for the woman yeah it has to be some form there's are really scared getting prosecuted doctors are scared of of going to jail of losing our licenses as well also arguing that some women should be allowed to obtain an abortion like if you need a “good girl” abortion if you for example were the victim of SA because who they're really looking to punish here is women who engage freely in seggs also arguing that seggsual women are unfit for leadership or that women who have achieved things have only achieved those things because of their sexuality not their hard work and intelligence pushing the messaging that women who oppose them should be met with violence and when dad gets home you know what he says you've been a bad girl you've been a bad little girl and you're getting a vigorous spanking suggesting that women who advocate for themselves are concerned for their rights are misled and stupid dummy and blasted the view host says quote degenerates and dumb women she's a dummy I watch her over the years that is one dumb that is one dumb woman okay I'm gonna pause there um maybe we need a part two on this but basically the take home is that misogyny is a tool we're trying to use social stigma laws policies anything we can control women and make sure that they're not getting out of the box that we put them in the messages do as we say because if you don't you may be met with threats of violence actual violence social stigma social pressures shaming other forms of deterrence and you may also be rewarded for being a good girl raising women who stay in the home who are married to a man who do reproductive labor and do it with a smile unfortunately there are so many more examples from this election cycle and prior election cycles um comment the ones that really stick out in your mind I'm the feminist lawyer follow me if you enjoy being miserable
