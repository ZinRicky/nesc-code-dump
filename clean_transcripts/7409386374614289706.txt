is you have to weigh the moments completely differently than how you would weigh them if it was just you and your spouse because an entire day will never be all good especially with multiple kids the events that you plan to do and the activities that you think are gonna be so fun might end up being the hardest parts of the day you can also be having the best day ever the best family activity everybody's in good mood and it could all be derailed by a missing show or wrong coloured plate so over the years I've just decided to weigh the good moments so much more significantly than the hard ones because the hard ones are guaranteed to come the little good moments where everybody's having a good time and everything's going right are so magical because they're so rare this goes double or triple if you have multiple kids or if you have super young kids because life can be sunshine and rainbows until all the clouds come home then you find yourself in a shit storm of terrible like the little gaslighters they are they will turn their two just as fast as they turn dark and you'll be left there reeling wondering what just happened because one of the main differences between adults and kids is that kids rebound and reset way faster than we do
