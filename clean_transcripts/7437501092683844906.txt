Christmas came early for me. Thanks to Lowe's, I finally got a new sweeper. So I got this one off of their website. I got a 10 Co I floor three complete, which sweeps and mops your floor at the same time, which is a game changer to me. It moves so nice, and it picks up everything. As you can see. As you go forward, it sweeps, and when you pull back, it mops. I put it to the test behind my couch, the dog hair accumulates. It did a great job picking up all the dog hair and mopping the floor clean. There was literally nothing left on the ground after I was done. If you're looking for a new sweeper that is quick and easy to use, I definitely recommend this one. Look at all the nasty stuff it picked up. Even the kids played in the Lowe's box hours after we got it. Thanks, lows.
