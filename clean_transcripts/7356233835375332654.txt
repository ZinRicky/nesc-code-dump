Men's relationships always abruptly end, and you're like, what happened? You guys seemed so perfect for each other. They're like, yeah, she got a little crazy. Actually, come to think of it, she was always a little crazy. Would scream at me. I'd always catch her texting her ex, like, did you not see these red flags in the beginning? Why do men start dating someone new and ignore all of the red flags? Men are just way too nice and forgiving.
