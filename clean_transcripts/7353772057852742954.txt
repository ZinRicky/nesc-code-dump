every day every single day of my life I am so thankful so thankful for Jesus there's not a day not one day that has went by since I rededicated my life to the Lord four years ago that I have not just been blown away by the mercy and Grace of God why he is so good to me I don't know other than this just his character his character is so pure and so holy and he outdoes himself I don't serve him for anything that he can give me it's just who he is he he literally could give me nothing for the rest of my life and I would be more than satisfied because he saved me and has made me into a whole different person thank you Jesus
