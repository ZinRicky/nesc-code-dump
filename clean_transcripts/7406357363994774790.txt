Our NDP government is following through on our commitment. Free birth control will be available in Manitoba beginning on October 1st. Our government will cover the prescription birth control costs for pills, IUDs, injections for anyone who has a prescription from a doctor or another healthcare provider. We know that over a lifetime, birth control can cost thousands of dollars. This announcement today is about reproductive justice. Free birth control gives women, girls and gender diverse folks freedom, the freedom to determine their paths that their lives take and the opportunity to live their best lives. And in a world where reproductive rights are increasingly threatened, our government's announcement today affirms reproductive healthcare as a human right and as a means of empowerment and liberation for Manitoba women, girls and gender diverse folks. Today and always, our government continues to affirm the reproductive rights of women and all Manitobans. Today's announcement will ensure that all Manitobans in need will have access to reliable contraception and secures their ability to make a reproductive life plan. And it further empowers women to make decisions around their education and careers that are solely based on their own hopes and dreams and not around unintended pregnancies.
