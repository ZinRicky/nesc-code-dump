guys I hit a milestone and I almost didn't even know I hit it if you don't know I'm Lisa I'm a first time homeschool mom and this is my first year homeschooling my 9 and 8 year old and we just made it to 180 days yesterday to be specific if you don't know when you home school or I guess when you go to traditional school as well a school year is counted as 180 learning days so as soon as you hit 180 you're technically done the school year no I'm not gonna stop schooling my kids we are gonna do a couple weeks off in the summer but that's really it because we like to take longer breaks throughout the year but I did it I did it I did a whole year of homeschooling and just so you know anything that we do from now on counts towards school days for the next school year so technically today is the first day of next school year for my kids I'm gonna do a video breaking down like what was good what was bad what was helpful what we're gonna do different next year in another thing because I've got to go grab my kids from a class right now but celebrating the win I did it I'm very proud of myself
