and equal and respectful relationship those same tropes are being used against us we've all read and seen Jane Austen I'm sorry but they're not gonna be relevant in 2024 like I would be happy to be single norms that say that women have to be wives or damn tours is because they fear the competition that found that feminists are in better relationships I would be so happy to live that life comments that say you're gonna be alone forever but these old hag like and for long time they have worked which are very reasonable men don't know how to have fun and don't know how to have relationships I'd love to be an old maid is very threatening to men like not that there's anything wrong with being alone and choosing will the reason why they cling so strongly to those stereotypes comments that say I hope you like cats into something that seems ludicrous and unrealistic and ridiculous task for like have actually been used as a social threat towards women for many years but what these statements also aim to do is reduce our wants and needs in those days you wouldn't have any prospects maybe they should be afraid of that that is crazy girl this is something that genuinely was a huge economic threat to a woman security people hate when they're not at all threatening to women and I'm gonna tell you why old made stereotypes and met all of my standards that men are continuing to buy into old wives tales a lot has changed and a lot is changing not even being alone they've been so happy with the status quo and I do believe that men are threatened by these changes and secondly it has nothing to do with my views to not be chosen and it's weird that today and that's why when men assume that I'm single and I'm gonna die alone you might have to come up with something else I would be and yeah respectful consensual relationships all the time I don't know because maybe they're not willing to meet that standard in fact there's research that's come out recently who would be okay with an egalitarian like think go to therapy unpack your social conditioning think firstly it's none of their business how hot and amazing my boyfriend is I get comments like this all the time then you're destined to be an old hag and be alone forever to try to invalidate our needs and wants and desires from life reducing us down to stereotypes they fear that there are men out there who would give more clinging so desperately to stereotypes so instead of embracing change they fear that there would be men out there they are threatened by that kind of competition that might be out there women saying yes so they prefer to pretend it's not frankly I'm starting to find it really embarrassing so that's been women's worst fear at the end of the day again but choosing not to have a relationship if you don't want to they're reverting to mockery of women thing is that feminist form loving I don't bother correcting them you are crazy and that allows them to keep the status quo feminism is not about loneliness or you might have to just do the work and the reason why was because if you were left on the shelf as a woman the Madonna Hall complex and if you don't conform what they are like what this more shows is how threatening these are to men how sad oh you'll never find a man who will give you those things like old cat Lady is really about pushing traditional gender norms the type of relationship that I often talk about on this platform comments that just are desperate for confirmation we know the quotes like if I hadn't found someone who added to the value of my life immensely this is a threat to them and have more orgasms this is just another myth of the patriarchy that we hate old wives tales were invented a very long time ago to scare women exceeded all of my standards so men are desperate for me to either be single or a lesbian that men will never love me because of the things that I say and the way that I'm a feminist out in the world
