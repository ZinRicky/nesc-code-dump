All the traveling and colder weather has made my skin extra dry lately, so it needs a little bit of extra help. After cleansing, I went in with the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Cream, which I love the thick texture of. The fact that it moisturizes me for 48 hours and instantly strengthens my skin's moisture barrier. I love that I can use Aveeno, which is proven to soothe and nourish sensitive and even eczema prone skin like mine. I love how it can keep me moisturized all day long.
