I was a little Moody today, so my fiance asked me ‘money aside, what do you need right now?’ I looked at him kind of shocked because what I need is the money you just put aside let's be real he thinks I'm joking but I've never been sad with money in my hand so I can spend it skipping through the aisles of target, with the coffee in my hand it's true happiness right there
