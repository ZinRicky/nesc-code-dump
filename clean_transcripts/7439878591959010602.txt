so my mom got a call from Costco today apparently there's a recall on carrots because they have E coli in them and we bought some of those carrot and just like take a guess what she packed for my dad for lunch today for work just like take a guess so and where my dad works there is really bad service so we’re freaking out like trying to call him make sure he does eat the carrots um luckily we got through everything is fine I think but just like in case you're wondering on how things are going all these food recalls they are result of the Trump presidency originally because he got rid of so many protections and like things that were supposed to keep us as consumers safe from bad work practices that would like endanger the consumer and now those don't exist  and they're about to get worse with the second Presidency so things are doing good
