My toddlers have been asking for marshmallows ever since we ran out, so today I decided to surprise them by making them some salted caramel marshmallows. I started by making the caramel syrup by melting down some sugar with some butter and then slowly adding in some heavy cream. I let it boil for a couple minutes and then add some flaky sea salt in before transferring it over to a glass container so that it can cool. Then I move on to making my marshmallows by combining some water and gelatin and letting that bloom. I wanted to keep these sugar free, so I used honey instead. Once my honey mixture was hot enough, I poured it in with the gelatin and whipped it until it was light and fluffy. In the meantime, I dusted my baking dish with some aroot powder and then spooned the marshmallow fluff into it. This was all very sticky, so I made sure my hands were damp before I went in to smooth it all out. My caramel sauce had cooled enough, so I put dollops on it on top of my marshmallow fluff and then swirled it in. Sprinkled some flaky sea salt on top and also some more aero root powder so it wouldn't stick. Let that sit for about five hours and then it was ready to get sliced. I went with bigger squares and the caramel on top was so perfect!
