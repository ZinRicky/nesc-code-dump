last week my dishwasher ate a wine glass and it's much easier to place blame on the dishwasher and not you know, user error but I'm one of these people who can't go to bed with dishes in the sink so after a date night with hubby I just jammed it into an already overly full dishwasher but I'm paranoid it's gonna happen again so I switched to the new Chux DishWand which is economically designed to fit inside narrow glassware you just fill it up with your favourite dishwashing liquid and close the anti-leak lid get it wet and give it a couple of presses until suds start to come out my favourite technique is the old swoosh & spin so I just rotate the wine glass while I work my way around with the non-scratch sponge I like it cause it's quick and easy it can reach right to the bottom of the wine glass and I don't need to fill up the whole sink once it's clean I rinse it out with fresh water give it a dry and I'm left with two sparkling glasses which aren't broken, might i add and with that done I can actually sleep peacefully
