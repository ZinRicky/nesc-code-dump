don't worry now I'm not trying to sell you some cute kittens although I do need to find five homes with these cute babies I am gonna tell you about this adorable pet mat that is just perfect for anyone who has pets inside the home we have several indoor pets in our homestead so I thought I'll give this a try and tell you how I really think about it first we gonna say wow like I love the pattern of this I love the ruffled edges it has a non slip grip on the bottom so if you have like a leather couch or sleeping material on your couch just won't slip off and the dogs jump up and on absolutely love the ruffled edges and the stitching is done really well the aesthetic of this pan matches my daughter's room perfectly it's just so Moody and has a cute chic vibe this is so much easier to wash than washing your whole bed sheets every time the dog jumps in the bed and it's on sale now
