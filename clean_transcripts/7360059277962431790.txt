my sister knows me she is the one that was there through my SuperWhoLock phase through my emo phase through my one direction phase and now you know 10 years later she's the one who's here post college like watching me become a person and I'm doing the same with her like my little sister is the valedictorian of CAS NYU right now and we just had this conversation about how like her friends from college like they know her now but they didn't know her when she was in high school and her friends in high school they don't really know fully who she is now and we were like we know each other we're the only ones that are gonna always know each other because we are the only ones that are gonna be in our lives forever you know I have immigrant parents and they really stressed family when I was growing up and me and my sister weren't always the best of friends we're always friends but not not the way we are now and now we're roommates like she is the most important person in my life hands down I would do anything for her I love her so much my parents really stress like friends they come and go but like your family your sister is going to be the person at your side at all times and I love her so much
