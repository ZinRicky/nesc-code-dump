here's the awesome part about fear the more you think about it you can calm those fears you can absolutely train yourself to not be scared anymore that's how people climb mountains you know become helicopter pilots do all kinds of wild shit you just train yourself to learn that this feud all a fucking mind game and that's why thinking is the first step cause the more you think about it you desensitize yourself to it and once you desensitize you start taking little steps and then one day you take the whole fucking jump and you leave so the more you think about it the more that's why you know men don't really like us making this kind of content because we can encourage each other and get each other to leave all the men that are leaving me hate comments telling me how much they hate me it's their wives in the DMs telling me how do I leave how did you do it please help me help me help me so continue to consume this content continue to fucking you know they say uh you're gonna be the sum of the people you keep closest to you while in these relationships you're pretty fucking isolated or maybe you know your friends in real life don't know what the fuck is going on so you can kinda have this private little society community that you keep in your pocket that is encouraging you and keeping you going and when you get scared you do have somewhere to look to remind you I can do this I can do this you know the people closest to you are not always gonna be the most supportive it is really fucking scary but you just desensitize yourself to it realise other people have done this okay okay just like when you're at the pool in the summertime everybody else is jumping off the diving board and you're like that looks scary as fuck you know by the end of summer you see him enough and you're like fuck this and you end up jumping off the diving board and you realize oh shit that's fun you got this
