so I'm getting ready to take my Broadway loving daughter to go see Idina Menzel tonight and we're putting our outfit together so I'm actually gonna wear this dress but I'm gonna wear it as a skirt with this over top so this year we took my daughter to New York to Broadway for her birthday for her ninth birthday she's now almost 10 but she is such a huge wicked fan and of course they know Dina Menzel from frozen so she is absolutely psyched and this is a fun hack I just tucked this top part of the dress into itself and I'm gonna use it as a skirt instead it's a little wrinkly but honestly it's so humid in Charleston that I think it's gonna fall and just be fine gonna add this like studded belt and these really fun like evil eye earrings I'm gonna go with these because they match the color just so perfectly now when I say my daughter loves Edina Menzel she has listened to every rendition of Dina Menzel's songs that she could find she asked me yesterday who my three most favorite famous people were and I was pretty stumped but she wasn't she said Edina Menzel Zac Efron and oh I forget the third one but Edina and Zac Efron are pretty solid choices she's a musical theatre girly and we love that and I grew up in New York and I saw Edina and soul in Broadway when I was probably way too young to see rent um but I've been a lifelong fan ever since and sharing this sort of stuff with my daughter is one of my favorite things about motherhood honestly it's just so cool time to brush out the curls now it is so human in Charleston that this just might not even matter you might end up at sweaty by the end of the night anyway gonna add this necklace and this is the bag we're going with alright and that is the outfit hopefully I don't sweat to death but I am so excited for this I can't wait
