we will not win this election by asking them to tone down their masculinity we will win this election by asking them to ramp it up I am in Wisconsin and I'm talking to male voters here and it's very clear that their shift to the right is not because they're upset about women's place in society but rather because they're confused about their own what it means to be a man in society is very different when what it means to be a woman has changed dramatically and the right is using that to their advantage that's why Trump is like on his like masculinity eraâ€™s tour but the solution to this problem is not to minimize the importance of masculinity it's to stress Trump's lack of it and help men realise that voting progressive is the most masculine thing you can do what we need is a positive vision of masculinity and encouraging men to make a decision at the ballot box that aligns with that aspirational definition so what does that mean practically speaking it means framing Trump's abortion bans as the lethal threat that they are to women and girls and the men who vote for them as failing in their most primal and important role as protector of women it also means validating men's desire to be providers and making sure that they know that Kama Harris's policies will actually make that dream more possible because Trump just wants Elon Musk to pay less taxes than you it means calling men who bow down to fascists weak so no we don't need men to be less masculine or less tough we actually need men to toughen up if men are looking to play a central and important role in society right now this is the moment my only question is what will you do to protect us tough men protect women so why are you defending women
