the Monday after Daylight Savings time means my kids are up at 6:30 instead of 7:30 and we all know how I feel about and if you don't just know I'm not here for it I like slow mornings and getting our work done in the afternoon but since the kids are up so early we start our day at 8:30 we were able to get all of our language arts lesson done before Maverick starts speech therapy normally I do reading lessons separate because they're at different levels but Maverick was learning the N G constant team and that's something Madison has been struggling with so I had her join in as a little review and of course she nailed it today and ended up being teacher for Maverick which gave her a little confidence boost and for my reluctant reader that was away the weather was so nice today so we took our read aloud and science outside it was like a little preview of winter when we do most of our stuff outdoors but it's still early November in Florida so it got a little toasty and we ended up coming inside to finish the rest because we do block scheduling I rotate our course subjects every day on Mondays we do reading science and Bible my daughter has needs some extra reading practice so this schedule works really really well for us
