okay so whenever people ask to make plans or hang out I usually just say oh yeah hit me up I will not be hanging out I will be loafing on the couch with my soft PJs on maybe with a snack maybe drinking a nice little fizzy soda cuddling with my cats while I watch reruns of friends then after I sat there for hours scrolling on my phone relaxing 7:30 hits and then I'll be heading off to do my skincare brush my teeth floss just so I can get into bed at a respectable time that time it's usually eight PM so yeah no I can't hang out or make plans hope you understand
