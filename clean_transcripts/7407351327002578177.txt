I'm just a girl and sometimes girls just need fish and chips and lately I've been craving them like a seagull at the beach so I decided to make them I started by peeling washing and slicing my agria potatoes into chippy shapes and then I popped those into a bowl of ice water which will help remove the starch from the potatoes and make them crispier and while that worked it's magic I got started on my batter I combined flour corn flour baking powder salt pepper and beer and I add the beer slowly while stirring until I get my desired consistency which should look something like this and if you're not also drinking the beer at the same time then you're doing it wrong then I drained and dried my potatoes before popping them in a preheated and pre oiled tray salting them and putting them in the oven at about 200 stirring frequently before I got started on my slaw cause I don't know about you but I fucking love a salad and I don't think a meal is complete without one Thinly sliced some green and purple cabbage shallots capsicum and carrots and then I diced up some coriander which I'm gonna pop into the dressing for the dressing I combined soy sauce rice wine vinegar sesame oil peanut butter lemon juice and brown sugar give that a whisk before adding some toasted sesame seeds and my coriander then it was time to assemble my salad and lately I've been getting really into massaging them and don't ask me why but just trust me when I say it does make them taste better added some micro greens and washed my gloves so I can reuse them next time then it was time to shallow fry my fish and you could probably do this in an air fryer if you wanted a healthier version but I didn't I want that greasy fish and chippery flavour I tried to make a tartare sauce which turned out more like Big Mac sauce but I'm not complaining and while I might be unhinged I'm not totally insane so tomato sauce always goes on the side And when I tell you it was light, it was crispy it was fkn phenomenal fish and chips
