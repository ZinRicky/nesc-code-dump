I managed to keep this trip a complete secret from the kids until last night and Iâ€™ve been bursting with excitement to tell them for months because holidays like this are a rarity for our family I was actually hoping to keep it a surprise until we got to the airport but it turns out planning everything packing everything and cleaning the house for the housesitters is a dead giveaway think I freaked out a few people at the airport by carrying around this baby doll maybe I shouldn't have been holding it by one leg upside down my holiday read is a court of thorns and roses and I know I'm late to the party but I was skeptical okay I thought surely it can't be as good as everybody says it is but it is it was late afternoon by the time we got to beautiful Queenstown and of course everybody was exhausted I don't know what it is about travelling but it's tiring so we just wandered around the township for a while before finding some dinner at Sherwood this place is amazing they grow most of their own produce brew their own booze and everything is locally sourced we shared the slow roast lamb and some sides before calling it a night early because tomorrow is gonna be a busy day
