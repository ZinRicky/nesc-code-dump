My toddler stumbled into my room this morning asking for cereal for breakfast. He saw someone eating Fruit Loops and wanted those specifically, so I caved and just made her some. Started by combining some almond flour, maple syrup, coconut oil, and some tapioca flour giving that a good mix. Setting that aside and then got started on grinding up all of my dried fruit, I decided on a mango banana flavor, raspberry flavor, and also blueberry since that's her favorite fruit. My cereal dough into each bowl added a little bit more flour and gave that a really good mix. Once it all came together, I started forming my little cereal by getting a small amount of dough, rolling it out, and placing it on a Parchment paper lined baking sheet. While I was doing that, I also preheated my oven to about 350 degrees, and once that was ready, I smashed down my cereal and added a little hole in the middle. Before baking them for about eight to 10 minutes, I let them cool completely, topped them with some milk, and she absolutely loved them.
