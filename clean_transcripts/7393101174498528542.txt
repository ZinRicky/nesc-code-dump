If you invite me over and you explain a game to me, fine. It's all. It's good. I'll try my best to learn it, baby. Secret Hitler, whatever. I'll adapt to your culture. Like, I will make an effort. But if we're a few drinks in and you pull out some cards and we are not playing go fish, they're like. You started explaining, like, intricate rules, and I don't. It's, um, a form of torture.
