My husband's been on a real ice cream cake lately. We ran out of ice cream, so I decided to combine two of his favourite things, ice cream and cinnamon rolls, and make a cinnamon roll ice cream. Heated my milk mixture on the stove while I combined all of my egg yolks and gave that a good whisk before pouring in some of that hot milk. Then I transfer all of that back to the stove and let it thicken a little bit before adding it to a bowl with some heavy cream. Make sure to strain it just to get all the bits out. I added some vanilla and some more cinnamon before covering it with cling film and setting it in the fridge for a few hours. In the meantime, I made my cinnamon roll dough with some butter, some sugar, use some whole wheat flour, a little bit of milk, and obviously some more cinnamon. I let that go until it all came together in a cohesive dough before transferring it over to a bowl. I place this in the fridge until my mixture was cool. Right before churning my ice cream, I made a quick cinnamon swirl that I would drizzle on top of the ice cream. Once all of my ingredients were prepped, I turned on my ice cream Turner and poured in my ice cream mixture. I let that go until it thickened up before adding my cinnamon roll dough and letting that Go for another few minutes. Once it looked like soft serve, I transferred it over to my storage container. It needed a little bit more, so I drizzled it with my cinnamon swirl and some more of the dough that was left over, and then it was ready to go in the freezer for a few hours. By this time, both lucky and I couldn't wait any longer. So we had it. And it was so good that he stole that bowl, and I made myself another bowl. The different textures were so perfect, he actually ended up finishing that whole tray of ice cream. So I'm making a new batch.
