I'm entering that season of motherhood where my daughter is starting to steal my stuff, like my jewelry, my makeup, my hair supplies. So I'm trying to find things that we can share. She has blonde hair, I have darker hair. So I found these gimme hair ties which are really nice cause I can use the dark ones, she can use the light ones and they don't damage your hair, they're really soft, stretchy, they don't leave a Mark in the hair and they're really easy to use. She is just now like learning how to put her hair up in a ponytail and these are like a perfect for her to use on her own.
