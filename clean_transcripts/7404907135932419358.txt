Now that the kids are back in school, I love that I have more time to work out at home in peace. And I love that I got this app trainer from the TikTok shop. It now comes with a jump rope and a resistance band, and it's on sale. But I just love how easy it is to store and keep in my house. And it's right there sitting next to the TV, so I know I can grab it if I have time to be watching. And it helps me stay fit, stay in shape, and kind of burn that tension off. So if you're looking for something to do at home, this from the TikTok shop is a great option.
