the thing that y'all are not understanding is that being a fat person is legitimately traumatizing not like internet oh this is traumatizing traumatizing as in I this year was diagnosed with cptsd complex Post traumatic stress disorder as a result of growing up as a fat person and the trauma that comes with that there is legitimate trauma that comes with growing up as a child and believing that your entire value is tied into your body that no one will love you because you're fat and that you will not have any love any success any friends because you are fat society literally treats fat people as if we are worthless like like I don't know how y'all think that that shit is not gonna fuck people up like it just it does it messes with your head like I it's crazy because the amount of hate that I receive for being a fat person like if you guys saw like the shit people said to me on the internet you would be flabbergasted like this is not just like a quirky oh you know like it's really hard being fat no it's like in your developmental stages you are constantly thinking about your body and like feeling absolutely worthless to the point where like you feel dehumanized I don't know that shit it just it messes you up you know and like I'm dealing with it like it's I'm fine it's not like you know I think that experience is very different for everybody else and I think obviously this like this definitely varies person to person but like I don't think that y'all like can fully grasp the legitimate like trauma that comes with being a fat person in the world like I just I don't think that y'all fully get it nobody is meant to deal with that like level of consistent criticism and hatred it's not like oh like woe is me my life is so hard like sob story it's just like I I'm not saying this like to ask for sympathy by any means I'm just saying this because like I just genuinely don't think people understand the mental toll that it takes and it's really funny because if you're you're gonna say I care about fat people's health like the only reason I'm commenting on their body is because I care about their health like that's not true you don't you're a virtue signaling and you're using this idea of health to give you a reason to be cruel to fat people that's just that's literally what it is what if you actually cared about fat people's health like mental health is also a factor in that and a lot of time let's say a fat person can't take care of themselves I promise you if their mental health isn't good they're not gonna be healthy they're not gonna lose weight they're not gonna do anything that you want them to do so I don't know probably not the best person to talk about this topic because like I'm still figuring out what that means for myself and like you know I I still don't really fully understand how it impacts my life but like like it's just it's more than hurt feeling the way people are treated matters it impacts them it impacts the way they live their life it impacts our relationship with the world a lifetime of persistent and constant cruelty is going to have an impact on a person and you cannot claim to care about people if you are someone that is going to contribute to that
