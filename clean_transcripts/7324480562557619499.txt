Okay, day two of postpartum pageant prep is happening. My friend that does spray tanning and teeth whitening is coming up. She went all the way up to the farm so she can get me prepped for tomorrow because we leave tomorrow, which is so wild. Um, she does, like, a natural teeth whitening, which is safe for pregnancy and. And nursing. So she's gonna come up, do that, and spray tanned white. So we're starting out like a one negative one.
