I'm sitting in the truck with takeaways on my knee three kids and a dog in the back and we're racing the sunset to try and catch a glimpse of Comet C/2023 A3 and I would say I'm surprised weâ€™re late to a once in an 80,000 year event but honestly I'm not unfortunately but we made it out to Piha which is one of Auckland's western beaches it's about an hour away from the CBD and honestly this place feels like the edge of the earth the sunset kissed the sea and we were graced with a full moon and it was so beautiful that it made me feel tearful but also that could just be because I'm emotionally unstable so now I'm no astrologer and I'm also not entirely sure what we're looking for so while we were waiting for the sun to set I told the kids - and myself to brace ourselves for potential disappointment I made some dinner under the stars this is a fish and chip butty which is a Kiwi culinary classic white bread hot chips battered fish all smothered in tomato sauce and if you didn't know now you do then we tried to spot the comet I was told to look below and to the right of Venus right after sunset Venus is that big bright one in the middle there which means that the comet is right behind that cloud we didn't see it but somebody else did And somebody else took a picture of that picture and we took a picture of that person's picture of that picture and now you're watching a video of our picture of that picture's picture I've just ruined the word picture but yeah we've basically all seen the comment now
