I have been using this clarify serum from Primary Care for a few weeks now and the first time I used it I read the instructions and it said what I thought was apply 4 to 8 pumps to your skin I was like oh gosh that's that seems like a lot like I don't know but okay I'm gonna do it because that's what it says so I was like I'm gonna start the 4 pumps I put four pumps on my hand put it on my face and you could like fry an egg on my face with how much oil increases like pile up on my face so like this is something's not right I read it again 48 drops of this and it gives your skin a nice even complexion really nice so 48 drops not 48 pumps this is amazing
