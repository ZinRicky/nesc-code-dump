the kids do a farm school co op on Wednesdays and the day after is always the hardest day of the week for us farm school is over simulating fun and also really high cause it's a 4 hour outdoor class in the Florida so on Thursdays they just crash my daughter has been doing this for three years so I've gotten used to it but after four weeks off I kinda just forgot and my expectations for the day were just way too high my kids were overly emotional and sensitive from the start it just did not bring good attitudes or good effort so we're gonna eat some banana bread and try again tomorrow
