do you wanna know how absolutely fucking insane mom brain is I just forgot how old I was when I was talking to somebody and I told them the wrong age confidently I might add a lady asked me for an interview and she asked me how old I was and I was like I'm 38 fine fine and dandy right she calls back to confirm some details cause I just wanna double check that you're 38 because I just I found some like like a conflicting age I guess and something else that was posted about me or whatever I'm like no no no I just turned 38 I'm 37 and I don't even confidently believe this myself um because I had to Google it hey Google if I was born on this day and this year how old am I she was like bitch you're 37 you're 37 you're 30 fucking seven it doesn't really matter anymore but like um for publication sake
