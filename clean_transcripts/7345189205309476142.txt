You guys know I love my dresses and my fancy outfits, but I don't wear that 24 7. And when I don't, I need a really good sweatpant. And something that I need is something comfortable, long enough, because I'm 6 foot tall and just easy to move in. I love these Aritzia sweat fleece sweatpants. They come in so many different colors, and these are my two favorite ones. I love a neutral color, but then I'm also trying to branch out into wearing color. I don't know how I feel about it yet, but we're working on it. They're so comfy on the inside, and they come in two different lengths, so I usually always go with the tall. These sweats are what I wear when I've clocked in for the night and I'm just done with my day and ready to get comfortable.
