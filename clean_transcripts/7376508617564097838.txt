these nails have forever changed my life because up until now from March 2022 till now I have been exclusive hard gel girly this set press ons this is like these are strong they're very strong they're gel um but I don't think I'm literally ever going back to hard gel uh because for those of you don't know this thumbnail completely ripped off because of my hard gel I had a new set I banged it in something my entire nail came off never again still hasn't grown back mind you this happened end of February anyways fake nail just right on top of the skin don't judge me point is after this I'm literally never ever again gonna be sitting in a nail salon to get my nails done cause I don't know like how long they're gonna last me we're gonna see but like regardless even if it's like one week it would be cheaper to get these a brand new set in New York City cost like $110 these are like 20 never again officially you can call me a convert
