I can never accept people who say that like reading theory is not necessary to be an effective left someone once said that the only thing more tragic than a country that cannot read is a country that refuses to read this is what America is this is what America has been always and American anti intellectualism is such a beast that it's not just Republicans who are anti intellectuals right like the people who think the Democrats have a weather machine controlling the climate like no like even the American left is anti intellectual because it's just a very distinctly American thing to be anti intellectual and to have like an aversion to reading things written by experts every successful people's revolution in history in the world they were reading Marx dude people who didn't have marxists.org people who had very low literacy rates they were reading the Communist Manifesto they were reading State and Revolution they were reading Maoâ€™s little red book why can you not understand that the phone in front of your face is the reason why you don't wanna read and it's frying your brain and it's making you stupid and it's making you impatient and it's making you reactionary yes social media is a tool that we have to use because this is where everyone is this is how we connect to the youth um but like we can't teach you how to organize via TikTok dances like Somaya said like you we can't plan organizing we can't plan a revolution via an Instagram infographic like the great thing about reading versus consuming content in like a 10 million part TikTok series is that if you sit down and you read a book even for just like I don't know 20 minutes a day or an hour a day you're reading a book reading that book consuming that piece of media that doesn't have a comment section it forces you to listen you don't get to immediately respond or reply and being a good listener is what makes you a good communicator and we the people are never going to be able to come together and effectively organize if we cannot effectively communicate with each other and effectively listen to each other so I'm sorry open up marxists.org listen to Rev Left Radio or like other audiobook or podcast like resources limit your TikTok to 30 minutes a day for what it's worth leftist will always be making content on social media to try and you know recruit you guys and answer questions as best as we can but at some point yeah you you gotta crack open the Marx
