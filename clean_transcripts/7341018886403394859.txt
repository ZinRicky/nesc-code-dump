Is anyone truly mentally healthy? are there actually people/humans on this earth that are truly healthy individuals? are there people out there walking around with perfect social skills, emotional intelligence and regulation, and doesn't suffer from an identity crisis every few weeks? I don't know I just feel like a truly mentally healthy individual doesn't exist that concept seems really unachievable do they even exist? are there actual people out there that are mentally healthy?
