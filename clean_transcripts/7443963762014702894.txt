the holiday season is here and that means it's time for all of my favourite Christmas pop UPS get carried away Mount Pleasant is the one stop shop for all of your gourmet hosting needs and they transform their store into a literal gingerbread house for the holiday season hacked head to toe with incredible gifts for everyone in your family this is one of my favourite secrets to shopping for the holidays and don't forget their Fresh Market where you can get fresh and frozen gourmet foods so you can make hosting a little bit easier and spend less time in the kitchen and more time with your friends and speaking of spending time with friends you have to head to the purge to check out their new holiday cocktail menu this one was a take on a cranberry spritz which was both refreshing and delicious and you can't get through the holiday season without a classic and perfect peppermint espresso martini and don't forget that these pop UPS are for the whole family so they have adorable drinks for the kids served in these souvenir glasses now back to cocktails this tart and fruity martini is absolutely perfect for photos and to give you a break from some of the heavier cocktails during the holiday season the purchase the place to be for a holiday pop up in Mount Pleasant and I can't wait to go back over and over this holiday season hope to see you there happy holidays
