I will never get over the moral superiority of people who are actively forcing children to give birth and perform reproductive labor for their abusers and for the government these people who are not troubled by the fact that women across the country are describing themselves as walking coffins because their government will not allow them to terminate their non viable pregnancy why doesn't the government force everybody to give their organs for all of the children who die waiting on the organ donor list every year why don't we force everybody who can to give blood at their annual preventative checkups why don't we do those things you can't even take organs from a dead person these are real people with complicated pregnancies with complicated lives with dreams with facts that you don't know this moral superiority of sitting on your couch and getting on your keyboard and shaming people meanwhile you are inflicting serious harm on millions of women throughout the country yeah the times we are living in are utterly barbaric I completely agree with you on that
