let me tell you how I use these base 10 magnets today I gave each kid a number and they had to make that number using the hundreds tens and ones magnet and they wrote the number that they made on the regrouping board show them how we start in the ones and add the ones together and when the number is greater than 10 we have to recreate we did the same thing in the 10th place and how 10 tens make 100 the magnets are a really great visual aid to show this if you're gonna be teaching additional subtraction with your grouping I highly recommend you get this it's a really great way to make your math lesson hands on
