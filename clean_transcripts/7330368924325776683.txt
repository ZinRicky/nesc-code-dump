Let's make the crispiest German potato pancakes, also known as cutoffe puffa. I used to have these all the time growing up, especially in the winter time, and they're way better than any hash brown is. So I start off by grating some potatoes and make sure to squeeze out all the liquid, set that aside and put my potatoes in a bowl with some grated up onion, nutmeg, some eggs, and give that really good mix. Then I take my bowl with the potato water and make sure to drain all that water off and keep the starch at the bottom, which I add to my potatoes alongside some baking powder, just to make it a little bit more crispy. Then these need to be eaten with apple sauce, nothing else. So I started making my apple sauce by cutting up some honey crisp apples and adding them to my pot with some water and whatever sweetener you want. I use some maple syrup. Once they're really soft, I blend them up and there you go, you have your apple sauce. I formed the grated potatoes into little patties, fried them off, and then serve them alongside that warm apple sauce. And these were so, so good.
