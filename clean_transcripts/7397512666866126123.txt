I'm sure you've heard of the summer slow down and it's towards the end of summer where things start to slow down a bit well my summer is not slowing down and I have to make time to bake and I've been trying to figure out what I've been wanting to make I haven't baked a good bakery item in months because I've been on the go so much travelling with Little House in the Prairie doing different events working a ton but this is the time today is the day there's no time better than the present to spend some time in the kitchen and bake these lemon blueberry doughnuts but my favourite part about this recipe is that I have added the strawberry lemon icing that is mmm Chef's Kiss it is so good you have to give it a try because I really think that these make the doughnuts everything they need to be I don't know how much more I'll be able to bake in the next few months but today was perfect and I'm so thankful that I was able to make these doughnuts even though they were a little little too brown they were so good
