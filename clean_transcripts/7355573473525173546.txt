your early 20s are not the best time of your life I was just scrolling through TikTok and I saw this girl like having um like a heart to heart with herself about how everyone keeps telling her that the early 20s are the best time of her life and she's like um shouldn't it be better for reference she's a young some 20 something and I don't think the early 20s is the best part of your life because number one you're like probably freshly graduated college you're broke you're confused you don't know what you're doing the stakes are higher and you're trying to figure it out and all the while everyone's like oh you're an adult now peace I think the 30s are the best however that's because I haven't gotten to my 40s but what I do have is a gaggle of over 40 year old girlfriends here in Charleston Andrea Shaniqua and Juju Juju actually just turned 50 so she's the senior of the group and they have shown me that like it just keeps getting better in some ways not at all I am almost anxious to get to like my 40s because of how wonderful and vibrant and amazing these women are so if you're worried about getting older get yourself some older friends it'll completely change your perspective
