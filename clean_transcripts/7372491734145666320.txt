hi so I've been looking at options for the next girls and family to support because the last one we got to our goal so congrats Abdul and thank you so much everyone for donating to their gofundme and I have found a family I am really happy to say this time I'm gonna be supporting a mother and her two daughters so Rowan is organising this fundraiser they've raised 6,000 of their 50,000 dollar target they have two beautiful daughters and she wants to help them get to safety she says hi I'm a mother from Gaza I need help please help my children donate so if you have more than $1,000 in your account please head over there and donate $5 I know it doesn't seem like much but I have 150,000 followers on here so you do the math this is how Operation Olive Branch works different creators choose to use their power to promote these and ask their followers just to donate what they can if they can and if you can't please just share it watch this through to the end like all the things comment all of that stuff I think it's an overwhelming time for everyone and I think that this is something that we can at least do I'm gonna tag their account below and you can check it yourself if you want the link is in their Instagram here and I'll take that as well thank you so much
