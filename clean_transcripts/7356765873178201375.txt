What does big back mean? Quickly? Where does that come from? Quickly? Y'all don't even understand that that phobia in the words you use. Big back has nothing to do with that. It is literally big back. Big, big is the problem. Are y'all dumb? Like, actually. And they're making factors out of pillow shits. Fat phobic.
