One thing I love about being a girl is you can do and say just about anything without an excuse or reason you can be bad at anything and say I'm just a girl you can be a notoriously known bad driver and say I'm just a girl You could hit a curb get a flat tire and say I'm just a girl You can be bad at any sport or activity and say I'm just a girl You can go on a shopping spree after saying you're gonna save money and say I'm just a girl no argument or real explanation needed you could literally just say you're a girl Weâ€™re just girls trying to get by and there's something truly so purely joyful about it being a girl is so much fun
