run do not walk to get a copy of Jessica Valenti's new book on abortion I will be sharing so much of what I learn from this invaluable book and her expertise but I wanna start with this “abortion is an essential freedom necessary for the self determination of women and anyone else with the ability to get pregnant it is not tragic. it is not something to be apologized for, or a necessary evil it is proactively, objectively good. we are not the ones who are forcing children to give birth. we are not the ones making devastated women carry dead and dying fetuses. we are not the ones mandating that grape victims sign affidavits or prove that their attack really happened before being allowed to receive basic care forcing someone to be pregnant when they don't want to be is dangerous and cruel. and voters know it. ask your friends and family how their abortions changed them ask them what they were able to do what path they were able to take because they had the freedom to end a pregnancy when they needed to abortion is often framed as the end of something even pro choicers say someone terminated or ended a pregnancy but often it's very much the opposite for many abortion has been the start of something.”
