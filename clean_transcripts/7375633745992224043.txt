this is part two on what worked for us and what didn't after our first year home school what really worked was doing a combination of curriculum hands on learning and field trips I like being able to switch it up and follow where my kids are interested in and do a lot of hands on learning if we get like stagnant with doing workbook work another thing I really loved using and will continue to use for next year is the website Teachers Pay Teachers you can find curriculum you can find tests you can find projects you can find all these wonderful resources that have been created for students by teachers and for other teachers museum passes Charleston has tons of history so getting the passes to a couple museums meant that on days were like we weren't super motivated to sit down and do bookwork we could head to a museum something that did not work was trying to keep to a traditional school schedule both with our breaks and with our like daily schedule it is not the same it's not gonna be the same and that's kind of a good thing it's kind of the point I started looking at what we were learning over longer periods of time versus what we were doing every single day and we ended up on track anyway I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments too
