Have you ever realized when you ask a man what their type is they usually describe a woman by her traits maybe she she has blonde hair she's a brunette certain eye color certain body type when you ask a woman what her type is generally goes on personality traits woman will say their type is a man that's funny, charismatic charming, ambitious it's not usually reflected on anything physically I don't know what do you guys think you should ask somebody what their type is female or male and see the difference and how they respond I'm not saying men are shallow I'm not I'm just pointing out that what we look for in partners is definitely different I'm sure this doesn't apply for everyone initially men look for physical traits they just do, whatever catches their eye they know they like it and that's what they go after as women they don't really go off of looks yeah you might catch her eye If you're attractive and fit but generally women fall for guys who are funny have a personality doesn't really matter what body type you have usually as long as you share the same interest She likes hanging out with you men initially go for looks but then they decide to keep you around if you're nice or if you have a good personality Not all the time, you see guys that are really kind that are with some questionable women and the same goes for women
