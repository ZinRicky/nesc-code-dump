What I eat as a mom who's focused on optimal fertility and hormone health and as someone who avoids seed oils, artificial sugars, dyes, and preservatives at all costs. Pasture raised raw yolks and eggs for cholesterol and choline, which are vital for baby's brain development. Next, the most nutrient dense food on earth liver, which is rich in folate and vitamin A and necessary for the birth of a healthy, well developed baby. I like to take birthright on a daily basis because it's the only real food supplement that contains raw, freeze dried liver from regeneratively farmed cows that graze on lush pasture free of hormones, pesticides, Gmos, and glyphosate. In addition, my meals focus around pasture raised meats which are rich in amino acids, essential fat soluble vitamins, iron, and protein. I use leftover bones to make gelatinous rich bone broths which are especially nourishing, and I use broths to cook sprouted grains and to make soups with when making bread. I always source organically grown grains and stone, trying them immediately before souring and fermenting to pre digest the grain and make vitamins more bioavailable to my body. I eat sauerkraut often for its probiotics which contribute to a healthy gut microbiome. And I prioritize pasture fats which are rich in fat soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K2. And lastly, raw dairy from grass grazed cows, especially when cultured, is a superfood and I incorporate it into my daily diet.
