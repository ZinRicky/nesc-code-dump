join us for our first Black History Month field trip at the International African American History Museum in Charleston this is still a relatively new museum to Charleston we hadn't been there yet and I thought this was the perfect way to jumpstart our unit study on Black History Month it's a beautifully curated museum it tells the story of the African American population here in South Carolina starting with the African heritage and then moving to some of the cultural significance of the communities of the gullageechee here in Charleston the museum celebrates not just the trials and tribulations but also the accomplishments and celebrations of culture art of the African American population going through the civil rights movement and the right to vote up to modern times where we celebrate current artists pacemakers and movers in the community living in the south really changed my perspective and opened my eyes to a lot of the issues surrounding race and racism that started with the transatlantic slave trade but still persist an echo across the communities today I'm so glad there's so many resources to teach my children you should absolutely go check out the African American History Museum in Charleston
