we just need to be consistent barely eaten and there's no real rules and this year before something's gotta give I inevitably get interrupted by life and I'm not saying this for sympathy get through 45 minutes of yoga without the because I hurt my back pretty badly about 18 months ago I invite you to join me *couple more interruptions* and I'd be like nine months pregnant and upside down yours doesn't sound like mine the idea of moving through that pain and I didn't mean my entire life” “when I said I liked it hard worked a bit harder at healing it but then I think I had a bit of an epiphany sore tired busy mum who inevitably it's also really good at slowing down my spicy brain and I hope that you do it for you too I don't get the hype over 75 hard or 30 hard when I admit it to myself and I've started renovating a house I've been busy cause I will direct other than we just need to stretch our bodies a couple of times a week gets better is an easy thing to try and put off turns out I need quite a few things but anyway I herniated a disc I've moved cities with my family cause every fkn day is hard isn't it and here's one of life's little interruptions now but the thing that you to be honest don't see during that 48 hours is that I have barely slept and while I've gone through times where I've barely showered like I will renovate a room in 48 hours we don't need to be extreme 18 months has gone by pain free but for me I think this is a video about being a and I'm not sure how much of this you can relate to and during that 18 months then on the flip side anyway I'm doing this for me the first thing that I will give is whatever it is that I need meme that goes something like and we're gonna end with the shavasana it's fine and there's something just so deeply yummy about having a good stretch probably gonna feel a bit worse before it and hopefully my main intention is to slow the fk down and also when you're in pain but if each day we only have so much to give and decide whether it's gonna be hard or soft and this is also not a video where I pick a number kids needing something yoga was my daily non negotiable I've been rehabbing my mental health stirring shot up and knowing that it's and it never fails to remind me of that long before I was on TikTok I said this wasn't a yoga video because I'm not very good at yoga more for my own motivation but I recently realised that not a single day of the last which is crazy actually Cos when you’ve got three kids so much needs doing every single day But for quite a few years when the kids were little and barely done anything for myself it's relentless I already knew I was never gonna puts her body last anyway I digress and if this resonates with you and you're feeling like me Rewarding. but relentless so much attention into whatever it is that I'm currently working on this is not a yoga video
