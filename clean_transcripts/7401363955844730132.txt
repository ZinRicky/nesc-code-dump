as macabre as it may sound this night right here is probably gonna be what I think about when I'm on my deathbed but before I made it here the day started in winter fkn Wonderland at the top of the Crown Ranges At at 69 kilometres long and going up over 1,000 metres this road is definitely aiming to please and it doesn't just have impressive dimensions it's beautiful too but be warned it does get icy and it‚Äôs slippery when wet üòè  made it over to Wanaka for Puzzling World which boasts its been keeping it weird since ‚Äò73 and I've been keeping it weird since the 1900s so I feel totally at home here and if you ever wondered what the inside of my mind feels like I feel like this room is a pretty accurate depiction I haven't been here since I was about 16 and there's heaps of new wacky shit to buzz out over we made our way through the exhibitions before heading out to the maze the kids keep running off in three different directions so I had to dislocate my joints multiple times just to keep up It‚Äôs a good thing my pain receptors were removed alongside my frontal lobe made our way to the famous Wanaka tree which was.. fkn underwhelming actually did still have an impressive congregation of worshippers at its base so that's good at least then it was time to head back across the mountains cause we had a date with Coronet Peak I've never night skied before in fact I hadn‚Äôt even heard of it until we came to Queenstown but apparently on Wednesday and Friday nights you can come up here and ski this mountain in the evening truth be told we weren't actually planning on skiing in the evening we were trying to make it here during the day I don't know about you but I find with three kids it's hard to be on time for anything anyway my day plans going out the window was actually a blessing in disguise because this was such a fkn vibe Mark and I took turns tagging in and out on the kids so that we could have some time skiing by ourselves and that was actually really nice when it was time to take a break we found that they'd set up a DJ station, they‚Äôd lit a bunch of fires there was a dance floor and we of course has some mulled wine we got the kids a snack for the price of a full meal and everyone was just having such a good time we saw the most picturesque sunset and honestly its days like this where I just feel so grateful to be able to call Aotearoa my home by the way I know I still sound a bit snuffly so I apologise for that but I learnt a fact this week and I just have to share it with you but did you know that some of the oldest archaeological evidence of skiing is over 8,000 years old kind of wild to think such an overpriced sport has such practical and humble beginnings anyway this was a day for the books but tomorrow we're going home
