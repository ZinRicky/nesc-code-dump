I donâ€™t understand when girls say they have no hobbies my number one hobby is my fiance I wanna be in his presence 24/7 staring at him, kissing him, feeding him, telling him any of my passing thoughts, watching him work, that in itself is a hobby! whenever he leaves my presence I'm instantly like, I miss you so much! where are you? when are you gonna be home? I want him to text me every little detail when I'm not with him, I wanna feel like I'm with him. HE is my hobby! so no, I don't understand why don't you have a hobby?
