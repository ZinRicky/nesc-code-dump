I saw this busy board on TikTok shop and as a homeschool mum I was interested. So here I'm testing out with my one year old son. He was very attracted to the toy and was engaged in playing with it for a few minutes. Up next is my four year old daughter. She has ADHD and loses focus pretty quickly. She loved this toy and was engaged in it for several minutes. I did take it away from her, she wasn't done. But I did give it to my 7 year old son. He was very interested in it and wanted to know how it all worked. I could see this being really useful while travelling on aeroplane and public transport. Really did perform on all age groups and they were all interested. Later on in the evening I gave it to my son again when I was breastfeeding and it did stop him from twiddling
