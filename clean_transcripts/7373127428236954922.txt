Why am I getting ads for a South Park Ozempic episode? I am about to turn into a super villain! Maybe the fat villain trope was right. Because I'm about to be so evil. I'm gonna be a villain, and my first heist is gonna be to go to the Ozempic warehouse, steal it all so that no one can have any, and we could shut up about it. Because my last straw was seeing Guy Fury skinny on my Twitter today. Enough! Enough! Enough!
