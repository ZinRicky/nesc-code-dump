my kids have pulled a Freaky Friday move on my daughter used to be defiant and give me a hard time during lessons and my son used to be an angel and now they have flip flop don't get me wrong I'm glad I'm not battling them both at the same time but what is going on for the last few days my son has just been complaining that everything is just too hard he's too tired and he doesn't wanna do anything I'm trying to show him a little Grace because he is younger doing harder work but we've gotta work on that perseverance in that grade cause we're not gonna give up and not do something just because it's hard and quite honestly it's not even really that hard for him he just doesn't wanna try last year in kindergarten everything was just so easy for him so this is a little bit more challenging yeah I know you're gonna ask what do you do in moments like that first I always give him a break because learning is not gonna happen when he shut down like that if the weather is reasonable we usually go outside because outside fixes everything or I give him a snack and some time alone when he's calm down we talk about why he responded that way and what we could do differently so we're always gonna come back to that activity either today or tomorrow but it's going to get done because we don't quit just because it's hard
