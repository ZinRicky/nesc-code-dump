well I'm Doctor Zoe and I have a PhD in feminism and I wanna tell you about it and contribute to inequality power and control are actually ones that reinforce you need us because we protect you from the other men and then men turn around and say so benevolent sexism is when these supposedly positive actions and attributes we're supposed to feel grateful and indebted to men for protecting us from men and this means sometimes accepting gendered norms but in the long game by accepting the Protection of men so the narrative where men position themselves as the protectors of women would be made redundant who say why do we need them again then they by their own definition can actually be understood as a sort of patriarchal bargain never ever making us feel unsafe it's like to simplify the long game versus the short game which leads to women being unsafe in the first place and then we constantly have to navigate um power dynamics that exist between the genders whereby the idea um because you are unsafe because of men and uphold the patriarchy in the short game you might benefit from having the Protection of men that women need Protection is sustained in order to basically answer to women just with heaps of respect you're actually continuing to reinforce gender norms and gender roles as such patriarchy relies on this sort of self fulfilling prophecy and mythology never ever killing us that ultimately contribute to a society where men feel entitled over women so they've created a self fulfilling role for themselves based off of fear therefore if men started treating us really well even when they're to our detriment that is in order for women to survive within patriarchy I would like to ask why is it assumed that women need Protection and from whom oh because we need them for Protection equally have you ever heard of benevolent sexism because it seems to me like we have been conditioned to live with a fear of men
