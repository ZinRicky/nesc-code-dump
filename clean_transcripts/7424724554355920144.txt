a couple of days ago I had my first panic attack in probably a year and to be honest I've been in two minds about whether or not I even share that because I don't wanna bring down the vibes I definitely don't want sympathy and I know that I'm so blessed in so many ways it just feels wrong to complain But mental health is funny like that and I think it was a reminder to me that healing is not linear we have good days and we have bad days but we share it with someone we cry without shame when we need to and we try again tomorrow this evening was one of my first child free nights in a really long time all I felt like doing was going out into my garden grounding my energy spending some time with my husband having a cheeky drink and sowing some plans for tomorrow I don't know if it's just me but the world feels pretty heavy at the moment and if you're sensitive and you already have stuff going on it can feel like a lot So take time when you need it and invest it into the things that make you feel good
