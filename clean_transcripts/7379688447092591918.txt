Are tech companies suppressing information about abortion online? This article in the New York Times makes a pretty compelling argument why yes, they probably are. Reproductive health service providers like hey Jane, Mayday Health, and Aid Access. We're all talking about how social media and big search engines are limiting their information online. Exhibit A hey Jane has been limited or restricted or suspended on TikTok four times in the last year. Instagram also suspended Mayday Health account twice in 2022. One of the suspensions literally lasted five days. Let's not forget that the at feminist account was also suspended recently for 6 days. Hmm. This doesn't account for all the different times that post have probably been removed. That talk about the big A word. What's also wild is that even to say the word abortion on this video, I'm probably gonna be restricted. And it's not just social media being has literally suppressed information from Aid Access. A super vital healthcare provider that shares and sends abortion pills all around the world cannot advertise on their platforms. Amnesty International is asking that these big tech platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Bing, Google, all of them just share more information. why is information about abortion suppressed and how do we avoid it? How do we make sure people can get the accurate information they need? If Amnesty International is involved, it's clearly a human rights issue. Everyone has the right to free accessible abortion information, reproductive health care information, and It shouldn't be suppressed in a place where most people are getting information about their bodies.
