here's how I taught initial blends with magnetiles and in case you don't know an initial blend is when two consonants blend together at the beginning of a word not to be confused with a constant team because that's totally different a consonant blend both letters make their own sound and because I really wanted to focus on that blend together I only use three square magnetiles for this activity I wrote the first two consonants together on the first one and then I put the vow and final consonant on their own tiles we practice that initial blend a few times until it really flows and then we found out the whole word knocking down the triangle tiles as we were now because there are four individual sounds you could use four magnet tiles especially if your child is still having trouble hearing the individual sound like everything in homeschooling you do what works best for you and your child
