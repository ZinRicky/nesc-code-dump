While we are in the midst of our New Year's resolutions, which usually means drinking less and working out more, maybe eating a tad healthier, I wanted to send this reminder to whoever might need it. Skinny does not equal healthy. You see, about 4 5 years back, pre COVID, of course, I was in the best shape of my life. I was working out regularly. I was the thinnest I'd ever been. I was the most fit I'd ever been. Here's a little reference. I was a certifiable gym rat at this point. I'm currently not in that good of a shape. Some of my clothes don't fit very well. I have since had a third baby, and I have some well earned weight gain after eating and drinking everything in sight for the past six months. So does that bother me? A bit? Yeah. Will I be focusing on fitness in the New Year? Yes, but my fitness goals will not be aesthetic. I want to increase in stamina, strength, flexibility, balance, and endurance. Because when I was that fit, eating clean, obsessing over workout, pretty much orthorexic, my period stopped for four months and my immune system crashed. Looks can be deceiving.
