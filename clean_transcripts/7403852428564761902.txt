Here's everything I eat in a day. Four months postpartum now. As someone that loves to cook, I always start my day off with a hot cup of tea. Today it was some rooibos tea with milk. I also hate the taste of water, so I've been putting this hydration powder in my drink and also taking my vitamins every morning. This morning we're going for sweet, so I decided to make a quick raspberry crumble, and while that was baking, I moved on to making a vanilla whipped cream. This was one of my favourite breakfast I've made in a while, and I ended up finishing the entire baking tray. You guys know I need a midday beverage, so I made a cherry vanilla iced tea today, which was so divine. Had a bunch of Sun Gold tomatoes in the fridge, so obviously we were gonna make some pasta. I started by making my pasta dough, and while that was resting, I sliced up some shallots, garlic, let those soften, and then moved on to splitting all of my Sun Gold tomatoes. Since those were cooked down, I blended them up, started on rolling out my pasta. We decided on some spaghetti today, and once those were cooked, I combined them with the sauce, some butter, and kept adding pasta water until that all came together. Made a little side salad with some arugula Blanche, broccoli, Calabrian chili, bread crumbs and a simple lemon vinaigrette. I topped my pasta With a bunch of Parmesan cheese. And that was lunch. We ended up having quite a late dinner, and I wasn't in the mood to cook a bunch, so kept it very simple. And we made some caper chimichurri chicken wings, and I also decided on a tangy slaw. This dinner is going on my weekly rotation now, since it was so good. And I always have to finish off my day with something sweet, so I had some caramel ice cream that I made the other day.
