I am 5 9, and I'm probably like, 165 ish pounds, and I get a size large. This is how it fits. I don't like to be fucking squeezed. Like, if I got it, I could get it in a medium, and I could fit in a medium, but it would, like, suck it in, and that just makes my stomach hurt. I'm okay with people understanding I have intestines, so. And then sometimes, like today, I don't wanna be in the full fucking pink. Like, what's up? I'm in fucking pink. I just wear, like, a little sweater. Tone it down a bit. So kind of wear it like this. I really like it. It's really cute set. It's really comfy. I do like how bright it is. Like, even if I'm wearing a jacket, like, my little bright pink legs are sticking out. So if you want one of the link right here.
