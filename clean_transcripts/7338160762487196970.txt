I think it's complete bullshit and really cruel that women have to still function in this world. And it feels like your insides are being ripped apart. But I am glad that I have this little gadget from the TikTok shop to apply, like, heat right there. And it also even has a vibration if you want that. But just having the heat so focused and localized right there is a lifesaver when I have to still function in this bullshit ass world.
