you know what really makes my ass itch as women age especially after having children they are expected to bounce back they are expected to be the most perfect Polish plucked and Pilate version of themselves oh wow it's totally socially accepted and sometimes even admired for men to grow into a potato so while we decided that it was a moral failing of a 38 year old woman who popped out three kids to no longer fit into her jeans from when she was 25 we're being told it's because we just don't prioritize our health we're letting ourselves go when that's exactly what motherhood is by design it is letting go of your needs as a woman as an individual as a human being in service to your husband and children or at least that's the propaganda that they're trying to get you to believe a good wife a good mother gives up all self autonomy all selfish notions of personal identity and care for the betterment offer children and family but then what do they do they complain that she let herself go there she goes she didn't let herself go anywhere and we blame the woman because it's so much easier to put that on personal accountability right it's so much easier to say hmm she just doesn't care enough she just doesn't care enough to be sexy for her husband and then when he leaves we justify it as a collective society we will buy into the excuse of oh I just wasn't attracted to her anymore or she was too tired for sex all the time she didn't have enough time for me you know one of the tells not the only one but one of the tells I can tell that somebody has a good husband they look good they feel good because they have time because where do you think that time is coming from
