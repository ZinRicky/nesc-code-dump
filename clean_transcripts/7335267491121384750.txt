Did you know in China they have a breakup tax? like for example, let's say you date a girl a beautiful girl say she's 20 to 25 that's her peak the opinion in Asia is their best looking/ highest value years are from age 20 to 25 in their culture after 30, their value goes down if you date a woman from age 20 to 25 and you don't marry her you have to pay her cause you took the best years of her life the guy has to pay and depending on how beautiful she is how smart she is is she a lawyer etcetera that's how much you have to pay she's a lawyer and she's beautiful you have to pay like 200 k because you took the best years of her life and now no guy wants her because she's past her prime
