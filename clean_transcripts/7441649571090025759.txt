The problem with staying for the kids is that it tricks them into thinking their home life is normal. At least I had my mom and dad. As if divorce automatically equals absent parent. Because if someone was going to be a deadbeat, they already are. It reflects in their passion for parenting and the marriage. You're either giving your all to your kids, or you're giving them what's left over after you've catered to the person that you don't even seem to like anymore. So remind me again, who is it exactly that you're staying for?
