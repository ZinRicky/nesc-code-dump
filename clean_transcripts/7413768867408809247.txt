Home school mom outfit of the day. I have two rules. Number one, it has to be comfortable. Number two, it's got to be versatile. I've got to be able to do lessons with it and be on the go. So here it is today. I've got a black tank that I've had forever, gold necklace, and this Rev skort by Outdoor Nation. It is bomb. Buttery soft. I love that it is full coverage in the back and the front. It's got splits on both sides. Super cute pocket for my phone or keys. And it's high wasted so it can tuck everything in, keep you nice and supported. You can wear it for an outdoor adventure or just hanging out doing lessons at home.
