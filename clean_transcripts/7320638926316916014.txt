I literally don't understand people who don't sing in their car, because that's all me and my mom did. I was like, you don't sing in your car? Where do you sing? Where? Where do you belt it out? You know what I mean? I'm not gonna see any of these people. They're all passing by me. Sing it. Sing it. Fine.
