now I'm a single mom and I'm divorced and there's many times where I don't see my children for days their dad doesn't like me he doesn't tries to keep me out of their life and that's what he does and I never thought I would be able to wake up and still be happy I thought like life is gonna end if I can't see my kids and you know what I'm kinda glad that I went through this process and realised like oh for the first half of my life my life was centred around men and how can I find a man one that's gonna give me the life that I want and give me children and everything and then once I had children my life became centred around children and that made me miserable on a different level and so I'm glad that I ended up going through a divorce and having to split custody and go through all this because it helps me realise and stop hiding behind other people I'm not just somebody's daughter somebody's little sister someone's wife someone's mother I am my own actual individual person that stands on my own two feet has my own thoughts and everything all on my own I don't have to have anybody else to like qualify me as a human or to qualify my thoughts and my children are still my whole heart I love them with every ounce of my soul but now I also love myself I also have room for myself in my life and that feels amazing so if that's what's keeping you staying is I could never not see my kids for a day or two it's actually a good thing I think it helps you become even a better mother
