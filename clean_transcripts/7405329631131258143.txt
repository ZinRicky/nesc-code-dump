Yes, the rumors are true. We are hosting a party at the DNC for people who identify as hot. People asking me, how do I know if I'm hot? Do you think that women should keep their rights? You're hot. Or are you siding with a bunch of incels who want to put women in jail for having sex with you? Not hot. Hotness is a choice. If you just trust women with their own health care decisions.
