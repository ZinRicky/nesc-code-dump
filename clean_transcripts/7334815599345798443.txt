Here's all the food I made my husband for Super Bowl Sunday. I started off by making myself a blueberry thyme mocktail, and then I pickled some green cabbage. So I sliced it really finely with my mandolin, added some jalapenos, and then topped it with my vinegar mixture. I had my dough rising for a couple hours. Since I was making some burger buns, I cut those up and then form those into little balls and let those rise for another one to two hours just until they were soft. In the meantime, I got started on making some pretzel bites. Absolutely loves pretzel bites, so I knew that these had to be on the menu for tonight. So I made the dough, covered that until the gluten relaxed for about 15 to 30 minutes, then I rolled it into little ropes, cut my little bites, and then they went into my water with some baking soda. After 10 to 15 seconds, I popped them on the baking sheet, sprinkle them with salt, and then bake them until they were golden brown. When it was time to bake my little brioche burger buns, I topped them with my egg wash and some sesame seeds, and once they were all baked, I let them cool completely, and then I moved on to my chicken wings. I covered them in seasoning and then pop them in the oven for about an hour while I made a little side salad. I wanted Something refreshing to cut through all my other flavors. So I decided to make a blood orange fennel salad with a mustard vinaigrette. I set that aside while I started on my patties. I wanted to keep them simple, so I made a cilantro cumin Patty with some caramelized onion cheddar on top. I cut my buns in half, put the Patty on top, and assembled my burger with some arugula, pickled cabbage. And you cannot forget crispy onions. And I dust my wings and my buffalo sauce. I made, added some parsley. Also made a white cheddar sauce for my pretzel bites. And this bread was gone in an hour and a half.
