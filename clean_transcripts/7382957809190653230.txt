When did marriage start becoming so transactional? marriage is supposed to be about partnership Loving each other taking care of each other I swear people these days are like if he doesn't cook for me I'm not cooking for him if he doesn't do the dishes I'm not giving it up in bed it's not a transaction marriage is a partnership of love nurturing each other it shouldn't cost you anything it shouldn't be tit for tat it should be about taking care of the person you love
