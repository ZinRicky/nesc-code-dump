I don't feel like leaving the house today, but unless I have to how the fuck am I supposed to get out of this driveway? Always hot and it's so hot I'm in a bush in another bush. I don't normally park in this driveway and that is why. Okay, let's go. One thing about me that you probably should know is that I am actually an emo. My Spotify rep last year told me so and I'm not surprised because this is the sort of shit that I love to listen to. I have no idea why, but the traffic was so heavy and I kept having all these intrusive thoughts like I was gonna get into an accident or something but I was fine obviously. But does that happen to anyone else or just me? Okay, help me pick a dress option No. 1 option No. 2. I cannot zip up. This one's quite cute, but if I lean over getting more than you pack it for. I don't know. I just feel like it's a no immediately. No, I don't know. I'm not having very much luck. It's just bloody a lot of fabric. I can't I can't do it up. I can't do anything up by myself. It's kind of fire though. Could be quite cute to go like dark theme. Yeah, the amount of partners I've heard coming in to pick dresses up for this significant other. Oh my God, I can't I love love Also, I'm not having fun doing this. I don't like doing this last one. I am struggling. Cute dresser. My God, I was in that shop for like an hour and I wish I was joking. I think I tried on pretty much every dress, but I just feel like I don't know if I like suits, anything. Anyway, we found a dress. I don't really like shopping. I don't find it that enjoyable. I don't like trying things on and I just tried on so many things. Anyway, thank you for hanging out with me. You made it so much more enjoyable. I'm gonna go home. I'm gonna decompress for a little bit and then the kids are gonna be home not long after I get back. So I'm gonna leave it here. But, uh, we'll see you again very soon.
