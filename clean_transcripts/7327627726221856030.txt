so I have historically never had a skincare routine but I am finally like in a place where I'm 23 years old I'm going to see the little lines it's time you know like I don't know if you can see but my eyes I'm just starting to get like lines under my eyes I didn't have before and I'm really lucky that the skin on my face is pretty clear typically um I have HS Hydra is super achieved so I have like acne under my arms and like in my thighs and stuff which is a whole separate issue that I'll talk about maybe another time but because I like haven't had a lot of issues like with my skin here um I don't really just have a routine um I will occasionally like maybe once a month put on moisturizer when I remember um but for the most part I just like literally exist and put aquaphore on my lips so I was about to buy some products post strike but today I was hanging with my friend and she gifted me some creams that I'm gonna try prior to this all I knew about Drunk Elephant was the 10 year old at Sephora am I doing this right the 10 year olds at Sephora that like destroy it um but then I did some research in it seems like a good brand um $68 though for that is literally crazy so um also I don't know it was like put it on a certain way god I sound like an idiot I think that's way too much oh my god oh okay maybe I have to I clearly I'm not a beauty influencer for a reason because I don't know how this shit works I definitely put on too much eye cream she also give me a mini lineage sleep mask I used to have the pink one at some point or another I don't know mmm mango do you think about me is mmm I know like the big bottle of lineage is like 20 something bucks at Sephora and like that's fine but knowing that I can get it at TJ Maxx for like 16 bucks um is why would I spend extra money if I could just go to TJ Maxx you know anyways it's my new skin routine I guess these are the products I tried tonight we'll see if they work and I look beautiful tomorrow um thank you Madison I love you
