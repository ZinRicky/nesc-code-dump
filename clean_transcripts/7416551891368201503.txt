if you ever find yourself scrolling through Tradwife TikTok one thing you'll notice really quickly is tradwives never refer to their husbands by name it's always the husband my husband or hubby but they don't even mention their husbands first names and after a quick thought experiment I've realized why they do this and it's because calling their husbands by their names would remind us the viewers that he's ultimately just some guy and once we remember that he's just some guy everything about the aesthetic falls apart it becomes so unserious like take the statement “I believe it's my duty to obey and submit to my husband” sounds serious right? even if you don't agree with it sounds archaic medieval high stakes now take the statement “I believe it's my duty to submit to and obey Keith” Keith? you married a Keith? the man you're submitting to is Keith? we all know a Keith we all know some guy named Keith no one should be submitting to a Keith even if he is your husband Keith isn't a king Keith isn't the lord of the manor that's Keith from accounting you let Keith from accounting talk to you like that? girl we didn't even let Keith from accounting into the work group chat cause he had an android we didn’t want all of our bubbles to turn green
