what does a typical school day look like for us well it really depends on the day and the season right now it's summer we do not have any extracurricular activities and we haven't started our new curriculum yet so our days are pretty relaxed and we really only have to fit in speech therapy I love slow mornings and refuse to start our school day before 10:00am so the kids spend most of their morning playing depending on if it's a speech say we either start our morning at 10 or 11 and we always start our day with a read aloud in independent work I always try to do their reading instruction first one because it's the hardest and takes the most attention but two because it's also their least favourite subject and just wanna get it out of the way reading is also the only subject we don't do family style because my kids are at different abilities but everything else we do together because it's summer and we're not currently using a math curriculum I have been focusing a lot on math fluency to prepare for harder concepts in the fall so we've been doing a lot of math games that focus on addition and subtraction fluency we love playing games together so it is the highlight of our day and it makes us feel like we're playing and not learning I can't tell you how many times my kids have asked about doing math lessons this summer and didn't even realise that they were doing math their game it's just such a simple way to make math so fun depending on the day is going we might also add in Bible geography or science but those aren't required and then we end every school day with family reading time our summer schedule is chill but just enough to keep us in a routine and keep us on track
