Update on the curse. I look like I'm gonna be a church leader. Like, what, who, who evil I'd be. So the place that I'm going that I go to get my hair cut, I'm inside. Iron automatically does, like, blowouts, and he already started blowing my hair, and it, like, was too frizzy to put gel in. So I was like, whatever. Just finished a lot. And I literally look like I am going to church on Sunday and gonna bring a casserole dish with me. Like, I. I. No matter how I, like, lay this hair, I just look so, like, matronly and I don't know how to, like, I'm not meant. I'm not meant for blowout hair. And I was like, maybe I can clip it and, like. But the thing is, the bangs. Like, I finally. I cut bangs after a while cause I saw, like, see this, guys? I look fucking old. I look old and elderly. I look bad. Also, my nail. This is not on the nail bed, so I can't get long nails. So let's recap. And it's fashion week. Let's recap. Glasses, broken nails, short hair, not curly. Who am I? Who, what, who. Who am I? Because this. I don't. Okay, someone's pregnant. And thing is, the thing is, the thing is, I'm gonna handle it. Like, I'm gonna figure it out. But someone, someone is praying on my downfall, and I don't know which one of you bitches it Is I have some names. But I am going to be sending these curses back out 10 folds. Watch your back.
