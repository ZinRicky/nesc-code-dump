so I don't do but I do collect things and I love collecting like little vintage containers and also a lot of Sterling silver so in that I have a lot of fun little containers that if I did do that I would put it in I just wanted to show you so first of all I have this this is um like the first thing that I got that I was like oh this is if I did that I would do that I use it for perfume um so this is like a poison uh a poison ring and I got this in New Orleans um there's like a Hurricane in Florida and we had to drive and currently I just keep like this is really old um I haven't used this in a while but I currently keep um like a little cotton pad with some oil so like when I move around like fragrance oil and it's like perfume but if I did this would be a great place to put it okay also I recently got this and this is a Sterling silver needle holder like for sewing needles I when I bought this thought this was much bigger because I thought that it would be good to hold a cigarette uh but it much smaller than I anticipated it has like a little thing so tell me that would be like a cute little necklace and if I did this would be you know this would be really perfect um I just cleaned it all of this came off this little thing anyways so there's this then I have a couple of these Estee Lauder vintage like um solid perfume holders um and so they have like these little like little amber um like perfumes and they're awesome um I would put a little little baggy in here personally like I just like it would be so cun ty and there's this um Estee Lauder has like a bunch of these I also have a pendant one here's the pendant it's just the same concept like a little amber perfume solid perfume also I have this like little pearl cage which I could definitely put my antidepressants and I think that would be cute wellbutrin and I also have this I don't know if you can see it this like comes out and then this opens up I'm sorry literally what other purpose would I have for this empty space what else am I putting in here literally what is the point of this you know what the point of this is ah what so tell me what I should be putting in here cause I'm obviouslyâ€” I have enough issues I don't do that like I think I would go like I have ADHD also so like I just you know like my medication is literally meth(amphetamine, aka adderal) right so like I don't think I need to be adding anything else to the mix you know um so but like if you guys have any ideas for like what I can hide in these like little like like you're joking like what else this be for I don't know I like little trinkets and for some reason a lot of little trinkets just have secret like places to store things I'm only a person what am I supposed to what what conclusion am I supposed to come to anyways this is the consequence of hyperfixating on buying Sterling silver on eBay and I'm not gonna stop I am addicted I also have this is it um 800 silvers is like vintage and a vintage silver compact it's 800 silvers is not Sterling silver and this comes out so I just like put it in here and like you know just like handle it and the most of this would be like this would be my like go to ha ha it's this little perfume container and I'm gonna use I have a perfume oil again that I use I always basically smell like rose and baby powder cause I have this like one um like rose oil and it's again this is for perfume but like is it for perfume is that what it was intended for I don't know that's what I'm gonna use it for because that's what I'm gonna use it for and I'm gonna have it hanging on like a little necklace but like if tell me this wouldn't be like the perfect use anyways I just like I spend a lot of time on eBay and I spend a lot of time like looking at vintage sterling silver stuff and they just like they made a lot of stuff for sn uff and like they're so cool but I just like I have no use for that so I just like I'm like what am I gonna make these like little tiny containers for anyways that's my show and tell
