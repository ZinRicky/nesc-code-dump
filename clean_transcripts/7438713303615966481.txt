the coping for our pool renovation project just about ended me and if I had known I was gonna spend more than 20 hours sitting on the hard concrete working on it I might have reconsided all of my life decisions but ignorance as they say is bliss and at this point I'm about as ignorant as they come so I got to work mixing up my mortar and piping it in between my bricks the aim of the game here is to fix up some of the bricks where the mortar is cracked or missing and it was surprisingly a lot like decorating a fluffy vanilla sponge you know.. terrifying after the mortar had set It was time for me to try and make the bricks look like anything other than what they currently look like And Iâ€™ll tell ya deciding on the best approach to take with this coping has been nothing short of an absolute fkn nightmare we had a bunch of spare bricks out back so we tested out a lot of different ways that we might be able to give this a bit of a face lift cause unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it the coping is here to stay been told it's basically impossible to swap it out for anything and one thing about me is I do love the heritage that this home has we settled on a lime wash paint and while I got to work starting that, Mark was painstakingly cutting and shaping hundreds of tiles I said it in the last part and I'll say it again that spa has been a headache on our test bricks we also tried out a micro cement and also like a concrete paint and I liked the finished look because these bricks are pretty beat up but it also made me quite worried cause essentially it would just cover the bricks and I kinda wanna make them work but also most of my decisions are subject to change so today I'm just testing this out and seeing I like it Okay undercoats always look a bit like shit so don't judge me but I think I like the direction that this is heading in I'm gonna quickly paint it again and crack on with the grouting so I'm so sorry but you need to come back for the update
