Alright. I don't know if y'all noticed, um, my stuff may have disappeared for a little bit, so. Was not planning on that. Apparently, there was some issue with some of the things that I was posting, IE, supporting women who want to stay home with their babies. Anyway, I got it back. And I want to personally thank TikTok for understanding that I am just here to support women and I'm not shaming anyone, and I love all my followers. And I'm here to discuss my experience as a stay at home mom and what I went through when I tried to go back to work. And, yeah, there's so much I wanna say, but, you know, caution tape. I'll get back to posting on Monday. Mwah.
