maybe this is just a sign of how horribly bad my mental health has been these past few years but lately I've been really intrigued by the idea that we live in hell like not even just me saying like oh my god everything is so bad and we live in hell like the idea that the place that we are in like this realm of reality this plane of existence is literally the hell of another like better place and I'm not even trying to be pessimistic when I say that it's actually been helping me to view the world that we live in as the Bad Place because what little good that we do get in this life like all the good things that do exist in this world um it's like it makes you feel better knowing that it's not guaranteed to you um like they say that like the root of all suffering is like expectation and desire and so when you stop expecting good things like it makes you appreciate the good more and I used to fucking hate when people would say like just stop expecting good things to happen to you and then you'll be happy when good things do happen because like I'm a communist and I believe we have an obligation to like make the world a better place and make things easier for people but like it's so hard to reconcile this worldview that we ultimately live in a world that has justice in it when you see all the atrocities and again I might be speaking from the fact that for the past few years I have endured like an unspeakable amount of like agony because of an injustice that I've suffered but it's like a relief though to know that like we don't live in the Good Place we live in the Bad Place like The Good Place is not going haywire The Good Place is not off track this is just the Bad Place and this is how things go and the good that we do see is just trickling down on us we are all Ronald Reagan in hell and heaven is trickling down on us we were all sent here to hell to like learn whatever lessons we need to learn and there's a lot to be learned there's a lot to be learned um but it's just not very pleasant or easy or fun I mean there is a lot of fun to be had I'm gonna have fun in the end times I'm gonna have fucking fun um but yeah is it weird that that's like comforting to me that thought that we live in hell
