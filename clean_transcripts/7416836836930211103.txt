Single mothers raise criminals. Single mothers raise the worst kids on the planet. Single mother. Single mother. Yeah well how about you're so fucking busy arguing with your husband whilst talk about what your fucking kids turn out like. All the fucking therapy that your kids need, all the fucking re evaluating of what a real relationship should fucking look like. Cause they've been watching your fucked up ass fucking marriage all those years. Let's talk about that. Stop talking about the fucking criminal rate of children that were raised by single mothers. Cause there's mad fucking criminals in the world that were raised by ugly ass people that stayed married when they shouldn't have. So quit fucking focusing on single mothers. Cause I'm positive that the people who found those statistics and we're doing that study weren't doing it so you could throw it in a fucking single mother's face and be like your kids gonna be a criminal. It wasn't some fucking clap back to single mothers. I'm sure it was to show the support areas where there could be where we could inject more love and support. Not fucking criticism and judgement. Cause it's probably an ugly shitty marriage setting ugly shitty example. Don't feel bad cause you're a single mom.
