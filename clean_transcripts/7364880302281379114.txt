What I eat in a day as a mom who eats an ancestral diet and as someone who avoids seed oils, artificial sugars, dyes, and preservatives at all costs. I start my morning off with a glass of filtered water and lemon juice from my tree. Then I make a pour over coffee with organic mold free beans and a good amount of raw pasteurized cream. At 9:00am I whip up a batch of sourdough discard blueberry muffins which fermented overnight to neutralize phytic acid and enzyme inhibitors. While those bake I make 100% grass fed beef breakfast sausages and some eggs for my backyard pasta raised chickens. Then I take my birthright prenatal and hormone balancing supplement which I love because they're made with ancestral real foods like raw 100% grass fed beef liver and colostrum about fish row and oysters. At 10:00am I prepared a heritage breed hold chicken that had been pasture raised and slaughtered on my parents farm. Season with unrefined sea salt, pepper, herbs, garlic and onion. I let this bake in the oven at 300 degrees Fahrenheit until dinner time. Made myself a rock of your smoothie at two PM with my homegrown frozen peaches, tamarillos and garnished with bee pollen. Later that afternoon I whipped up a raw cheesecake using homemade raw cream cheese from my parents farm, eggs from my chickens, and a nut and date crust. We had dinner at 6 which was a chicken noodle soup topped with homemade pickled Radish and rock crout and some avocado followed by a slice of raw cheesecake. It was so delicious.
