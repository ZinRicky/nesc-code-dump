if you are heartbroken about what's going on in Gaza there are ways that you can directly help families there's a project called Olive Branch which I'm sure um many of you have been seeing in your feeds thanks to amazing creators who have been drawing attention to it they have this incredible spreadsheet where you can get involved in so many different ways what they're encouraging people to do no matter what your following is is to choose and sponsor a family and encourage people to support and uh donate to their fund in uh their disability column they uh drew attention to Ibrahim who is a psychologist who has worked with a lot of autistic children in Gaza he has an autistic daughter and I have decided to support their fund in order for them to escape any of the donations are $5 so I know that people are really strapped right now and I totally understand if you are not in a financial situation uh or position to make a donation but every dollar counts he is still trying to offer um support to autistic children who are being displaced right now his daughter needs medication and they cannot return to their home even when he was trying to evacuate he was still providing services for autistic children who are being displaced and who as you can probably imagine need so much support right now this is the centre that he created in Gaza for children with disabilities they need our support in order to keep providing those services if you can't afford um the donation you can go to his Instagram follow um like and engage with his videos so that more people can come across them and support him and the center I will put the link for the gofundme in my bio if you can't afford it right now um send it to someone who you think might be able to so much that we can do in order to support children um and families right now so again uh go to Olive Branch you'll find tons of ways of getting involved thank you for listening until the end of this video I love you
