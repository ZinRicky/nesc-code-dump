today's mission was to get all of our schoolwork done before 10:30 because today is their dad's birthday and the first day of the Fort Myers Boat Show which happens to be where Logan is working today and their grandparents wanted to take them to the boat show and surprise Logan so it's our goal to get everything done before speech therapy and we did they have been a shortened version of everything but that doesn't matter what felt like the real win was getting our school work done without a fight and no complaining and yes their snakes made an appearance today Madison's story today was about a snake and she wanted to read it to her snake and at this point I'll do just about anything to get her to read and find joy in reading so that means if we need to pull out the snakes we'll do it even if I absolutely do not like them today our day included a lot of read aloud now I genuinely enjoy reading but a literature based homeschool style is just not for me after two hours of reading out loud my throat hurts and I don't wanna read another book
