imagine you're a little kid and this is what your room looks like while you're falling asleep at night my kids are obsessed with this little night light projector astronaut he's so cute he can move around and he projects these beautiful lights onto their ceiling at night there are a bunch of different settings you can choose from his buttons on his back so you can change the colors and this make the room feel so calm so relaxing so magical it helps my kids fall asleep this is the absolute perfect gift for any kid that is on your Christmas list
