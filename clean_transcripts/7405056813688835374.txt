I was raped by my stepfather after years of sexual abuse at age 12 I took my first pregnancy test and it was positive that was the first time I was ever told you have options I can't imagine not having a choice but today that's the reality for men women and girls across the country because of Donald Trump's abortion date he calls it a beautiful thing what is so beautiful about a child having to carry her parent's child there are other survivors out there who have no options and I want you to know that we see you we hear you
