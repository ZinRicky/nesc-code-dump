Never would I have ever guessed that I'd be sitting here talking about how nice a shower curtain is. But, hey, here I am. First, I was impressed by the quality of the material. It was super thick, but yet lightweight at the same time. And it came with a nice, protective, weighted, waterproof barrier for the backside of the shower. So check out the link. If you like it, great. If you don't like it, well, you didn't hear from me.
