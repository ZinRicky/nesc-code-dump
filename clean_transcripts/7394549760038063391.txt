let me give you an update on what it's like single mom before I moved in with my boyfriend for the first time and um it's been interesting like a couple days after we moved in there was a waterfall in our bedroom and that kind of set the tone it was kind of shitty moving in has been shitty it's been a shitty experience and then we also had some miscommunications and then my car got bashed and fucked up so it's been like stress after stress after stress so I've definitely taken some time to tend to my personal life cause it's been a bit of a shitshow um moving in definitely helped highlight our communicate I didn't realize we had communication issues but we did and it um just brought a lot of stress he's not used to living with children so he was like what the fuck is going on and since I haven't had a car and I've had four kids plus the one kid I'm babysitting my boyfriend's kind of been losing his mind secretly and I didn't know that and then everything kind of came to a head him and I talked and I was like what is going on like you're not like we moved in and it feels like we barely hang out anymore you know we're like closer than we have been but we like never hang out with each other and he was like I just can't handle it like kids are driving me crazy but I'm not gonna snap on them so I've just been like trying to bite my tongue and I'm like oh well it's summertime so and he was like he totally forgot that this is not what life is like every day he's like just never has been this crazy I don't know what happened just because we didn't I was insane and I was like no it's just that it's summertime and I don't have a car right now so you know we're just all here bored out of our mind on top of each other and he was like so that's where I've been it just got way too much to try like I barely had enough energy for my life to try to share any energy online um so yeah I think things are finally settling I have finally like 90% unpacked and I feel shame again so I love you guys
