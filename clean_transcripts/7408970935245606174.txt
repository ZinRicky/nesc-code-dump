my kids called and asked me to come swim with them so let's get ready and head over to the property in case you're new here hi I'm Chelsea a 31 year old homeschool mom for the last 4 years we lived in an RV on our family compound here in the beginning stages of our house build but because of my health we decided to move into a rental until it's finished it's been a total blessing but the downside is that we had just finished our pool two weeks before we moved we had talked it up so much and the kids spent months watching it get built and they were devastated when we moved but it's only temporary and we can still go whenever we want
