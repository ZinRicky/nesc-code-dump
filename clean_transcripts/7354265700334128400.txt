apparently I'm a sucker for punishment so welcome to day 2 of our 5 day kids bedroom makeover quick reminder of where we started and since I saw you last my husband has plastered and sanded these walls so now I can prep and prime and as somebody in the thick of a whole house renovation I'm well aware that the most painful part of the process is prepping for paint but in every room I use this Dulux 1-step prep which is a primer sealer and undercoat all in one and it’s anti-mould which in my very damp 67 year old house I need I will say it's pretty thick pretty viscous kind of a bitch to get on respectfully but for the time that you save and the finish you get it's worth it so the brief at this point of the project was just to get this stuff literally everywhere and that was day two done on day three we came back and it was time to put some colour back in the space and this is usually where I get my motivation back because I can start to see my vision coming to life so quick backstory but my first born is about to turn 12 which is crazy and this bedroom is his birthday present and he currently has no idea what we're doing in here he did pick his bedding which helped us with colour and he asked for panelling but aside from that he's totally in the dark I don't know about you but whenever I look at a project I always gaslight myself into believing it's gonna be less work than it actually is and when it comes time you're like wow fk there really is a lot to do in here isn’t there  so I ended up painting that panelling three times and what I think is the perfect shade of green that's Te Horo by Dulux My husband did the ceiling and I did the windows which are always a nightmare and now I'm doing the second coat of the best creaming neutral I've ever met this is half glinks gully by Dulux and I'm using it right throughout my house and that is days 2 and 3 done but there are still so much to do so come back for the update
