the most annoying group of people to deal with as a fat person on the internet it's not like the dude bros making fun of me and calling me fat in my comments it's not Ed Twitter taking my videos and making me fatsp0 making fun of my body and everything about me so that they can starve themselves and not look like me no it's neither of those the group that is most annoying and irritated is the morally superior anti fat activist that takes fat people's content from TikTok cut it up upload it to **Youtube** making money off of our face our content our our movement because either they were fat and hate themselves are currently fat and hate themselves or just hate fat people in general I have had so many of my videos taken and put on the internet to be made fun of by a group of people that I don't know that doesn't follow and every single one takes my arguments in the worst light possible and makes me seem like I'm crazy like I don't know what I'm talking about like you know I'm I'm making everything up and then like search through your videos and try and like point out inaccuracies to look for some kind of proof that like fat people are all lying up being happy about themselves they're all lying up being content in their body and like there's literally no room for nuance with that and they all think that they're the good guy that's the crazy they make these videos take people's content out of context post it to a hostile audience and still think that they're the good guy that's the thing that's the most frustrating cause like they think that they're in the right like you are a villain you are a bad person leave me the heck alone
