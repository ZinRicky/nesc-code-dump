I promise I'm not pregnant. But this has been my favorite late night snack lately. It's actually 12:03. I just needed something sweet. We've been packing up the house all day long, so this is my newest obsession, you guys. Okay, I know it looks weird, but it's strawberry jello that I made and some vanilla cream. Sometimes I do a custard. I made my vanilla cream with some eggs, sugar, vanilla milk, the usual. This is so good. This is so good.
