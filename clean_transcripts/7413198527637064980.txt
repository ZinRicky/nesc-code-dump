after growing this I don't think I'm ever gonna look at mushrooms the same way again this is Maia Mycelium, my pet pink oyster mushroom and she's giving birth for the second time this season and unbeknownst to her I will eat her tasty babies but that macabre storyâ€™s for another day because for today all we need to know is that fungi are fkn fascinating her full fruiting process only took five days cause apparently mushrooms favour cell expansion over cell division so essentially they're just inflating cells that they already have which is wild I also don't know how to feel about the fact that some mushrooms can solve puzzles and I'm sure I don't need to remind you that they don't have a brain apparently they have a long and complicated history with humanity and may have even played a role in our consciousness and of course we can't forget that more than 600 types can turn their host into a literal zombie food for thought I guess
