good morning and let's make some coffee together Mav may have convinced me not to do school work but I still have so much stuff to do around the house today Logan and I are going away for the weekend and I need to do laundry pack and get this house in order before we leave we have not gone anywhere or done anything in months because of all of my health stuff I am so excited for this weekend now that my body is doing better physically it is time to conquer these mental battles health anxiety is real and it is almost harder to get past that than it was the physical side of things I'm excited for a low stress weekend without the kids where I can remind myself that I am strong and capable and can do all of the things again
