This has been my favorite late night snack lately. It's currently almost 12:00, but I needed a little late night snack. And this has been my favorite thing to make lately. It's Granny Smith apples with homemade caramel and some crushed up homemade pretzels. You guys, there's nothing better. I don't know what it is. It has to be Granny Smith apples. It can't be a honey crisp. It has to be kind of more tart. Caramel is really sweet, and then the pretzel is kind of crunchy and salty at the same time, which is such a good combination. Basically a caramel apple without having to go through the work and adding some pretzels on top.
