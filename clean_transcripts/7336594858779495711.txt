every few months I get a Larry video like a Larry Stylinson video on my for you page and I'm like I'm intrigued so I maybe I like it maybe maybe I save it maybe I send it to my friend and then for some reason my algorithms like so you like Larry Stylinson videos I'm gonna send you all of them and now I'm bombarded I'm bombarded with all of these Larry Stylinson like proof videos and it's like I'm supposed to be normal like how am I supposed like you expect me to have grown up normal when in my foundational moments in my in my most important vital moments instead of being a human 12 year old a normal human 12 year old what was I doing reading Larry Stylinson fanfiction watching edits looking at the the little small ways in which they interact with each other and hyper analyzing every single interaction they have and then surprisingly at my grown age 10 years later I have interactions with people and I'm like obviously they're in love with me like obviously this person who I have a deep friendship with I have a connection with is in love with me cause there's there's no other reason why he would be doing all these small little things and it's no it's just I'm insane and I'm surrounded by a bunch of insane other little girl because I was very into Destiel Larry Stylinson Dan and Phil like just so much potential content with queer subtext and like not to call them content like they're human beings but like you know what I mean I just consumed so much is it gay is it not gay is it love are they in love and I think it's fundamentally fucked with my head because now I like I look for things that literally aren't there they're not there nothing they weren't there there you know what I mean anyways yeah I um anyways I've never been in a successful relationship because I'm not normal
