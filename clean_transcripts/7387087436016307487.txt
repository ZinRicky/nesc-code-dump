This is what I typically eat in a day as a recipe mom and a mom nourishing herself. Preconception. So starting off I always have three eggs, my homemade sourdough bread with grass fed butter and pasture a sausage. Then I was in my ovulation phase, so afterwards I had a raw milk Yogi coffee. Then I have my supplements called liver oil, beef liver, and I have some bruises for foliage and all the good stuff. Then as a morning snack, I have a protein shake, raw milk protein shake packed with grass fed whey protein, B pollen, all the nutrients. For lunch I had homemade yogurt sauce, grass fed beef, homemade tortillas, cucumbers and tomatoes. I always like to have my herbal iced tea with a splash of homemade lemonade and then my rocker salad in between lunch and my afternoon snack. Then I had a little bit of kafir kefir, rock kefir, and then I had my afternoon snack which was raw cheese, bee pollen, honey, homemade sourdough crackers, smoked oysters, cherries, and a seaweed snack. Then for dinner I had homemade meat sauce with raw cheese and pasta. As a bedtime snack, I had raw milk with grass fruit, collagen and colostrum. Then I had a B vitamin and folate and collagen filled chocolate chip cookie.
