growing up in a society that is built on racism fatphobia homophobia transphobia ableism classism like that is the the foundation of existing in a capital society right so when you grow up in a society that is that fundamentally depends on the exploitation of people and the lack of respect of marginalized groups everybody that exists within that society is going to be instilled with these prejudice beliefs whether or not they're intentional just by by virtue of existing in that society right for example with the conversation of racism you can be doing things as a non black person that are racist without intending to do so and the only way that you will be aware and understand what you are doing is taking the time to educate yourself on issues about race right if you're taking the time to listen to black and brown people about their experiences right if you are a white person you don't have these experiences that's not going to be inherent to you it's not going to be inherently obvious to you because that education is not readily available to you right so similarly not the same but similarly as a fat person right I understand that if you are not fat or even if you are fat but you are not someone who understands and engages in fat politic you may do things and say things that are fatphobic right and saying something is fatphobic is not a moral judgement cause I when I say this is fatphobic I'm not saying you're a bad person you're evil like whatever I am just saying this action has anti fat bias behind it right so I as a fat person as someone who tries to do my best to share the information and knowledge I have I try and share that education with that I wanna talk about this trend of former fats in the way specifically about how they talk about their former body I am not denigrating anyone for losing weight I understand what it's like to live in a fatphobic society I understand wanting to lose weight for health I understand all of that right I am not saying that you shouldn't lose weight I wanna make that clear okay when people lose weight or on a weight loss journey my issue is when they talk about their former body negatively or they talk about fat people in general negatively right so if you are someone who previously was fat and you're you're saying like that you used to be ugly that were flabby or unflattering or like whatever that is an inherently fatphobic statement I'm not saying you're a bad person I'm saying that that statement is a anti fat way of thinking and me pointing that out and saying this is fatphobic is not any kind of judgement or moral it is just letting you know this is fatphobic if you care to be more considerate if you care you can take that information going forward and be like oh talking negatively about my former fat body even though it's my body is talking negatively about a fat body and by doing that that is reflecting the perception that I have of other fat people anyways it's it's your choice whether or not you wanna listen to what fat people say like if you don't care about not being fatphobic and like that's fine that's fine you know what I mean you do young uh hey I can only give you that information and point it out and what what happens after is your choice completely but if you are someone who cares about social justice if you care about people if you care about being empathetic if you you know if you if you care about these things and like I would urge you to listen to people with different perspectives who may have more understanding and education on a topic that you are not fully aware of everything I know I've Learned from listening to other people especially in marginalized groups that I'm not part of like I can't be you know an anti racist person if I don't listen to black and brown people when they talk about their experiences with racism like in order for me to unpack the internalized racism that is inherent to living in a country that is inherently racist which is all of them um you have to listen to black people and like what they say right and again not the same but similarly for fatness we are all ingrained with certain levels of fatphobia in us right we live in a very fatphobic society in a society that inherently degrades and you know dehumanizes fat people so if you don't wanna be someone with those prejudices you have to listen to fat people people often struggle with understanding why fat liberation is even a thing right why why fat people are even talking about it if we don't wanna deal with these things then we should just lose weight right even if tomorrow everyone started to lose weight there would still be fat people the way that we think about fatness in our culture is we view it as an inherently temporary state we view fatness as something that is going to change because you have to want to become thin that is the primary Assumption but what if somebody is just fat like what if that's just their body you know like there are just fat people like there are people that are you know born fat and die fat and like that's just what it is and I don't think that every human being needs to lose weight in order to be treated with respect kindness and empathy right I would hope that you guys agree with me but you know when I try and share information about fatness or you know I try and educate people I'm not I'm not trying to be malicious I'm just genuinely trying to educate because I'm assuming you guys don't have the perspective that I do because if you didn't grow up fat if you are not surrounded by fat politic and understand like this kind of world then you're not gonna understand that perspective and that's okay right but like I'm trying to share that perspective and I would hope you guys would wanna listen
