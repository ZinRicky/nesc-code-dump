yes absolutely this narrative that having an abortion is the worst most traumatic day of a woman's life is not at all backed by research and it's a really harmful narrative because the anti choice movement uses it to fuel a stereotype that women regret their abortions and therefore we should not allow women the choice to get one which in the turnaway study which is the largest study done comparing women who were denied wanted abortions versus women who received a wanted abortion they talk about this it's called the dignity of risk that basically women should have the right to make their own personal decisions even decisions they might regret however the research shows that regret is not the most common or even close to the most common response to having an abortion overwhelmingly the most common emotion felt after having an abortion was relief at 90% those who were denied an abortion the most common emotions were sadness followed by regret the most common emotional response to having an abortion is actually none over time two thirds of women say that they experience no or very few emotions about the abortion anymore they also talk about how this is because women have a lot more going on in their lives than their abortion um 95% of women reported that having the abortion was the right decision for them and if you're wondering about that remaining 5% the 5% reported high community stigma that their groups their social groups shamed them and made them feel very bad about their abortion and it LED them feeling like their decision to have an abortion was very difficult and that they somewhat regretted it the women who had the hardest time emotionally were those who placed the child for adoption so this idea that we should just force women to have birth because they can just give the child up for adoption adoption is not a band aid for forced birth
