You wanna know where people go wrong in relationships where they go wrong is judging their partners everyday choices Saying, oh that's not how you do that or oh why are we parking so far or oh why did you turn into this lane oh that's not how you do dishes If you mindlessly do these things then you're causing friction in your relationship without even realizing it or they end up not liking you anymore or they just become disdainful towards you when you question somebody's actions whatever it may be, in everyday life then feel like they can't do anything right they feel like they're always in the wrong nobody wants to be in a relationship where they feel like everything they do is wrong if you do these things and you don't even realize it try to catch yourself before you do it You want to make your partner feel special not like they can't do anything right stop questioning their actions and trust their judgment At the end of the day It doesn't matter how you do things doesn't matter where you're parking and it doesn't necessarily matter how they do the dishes they're doing it that should count right Instead you should start appreciating that they're putting an effort or that they're doing these things for you if you don't want a failed relationship then start looking at things in a positive light start appreciating them for doing the dishes to begin with For doing whatever project to begin with to be driving you give them a little bit of credit if you want a long lasting loving relationship huh Frank I love you, say it say it back, okay bye
