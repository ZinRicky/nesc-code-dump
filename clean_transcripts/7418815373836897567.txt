You guys, I have found the perfect pair of leggings. I got these from the TikTok shop. They're linked right here. Not only are these so stretchy, they have the thick band for the tummy control. There's a pocket up in here and a pocket on each side. And they're that buttery soft, like delicious fabric. I love them. I got them in gray and I got them in black. They are worth every penny.
