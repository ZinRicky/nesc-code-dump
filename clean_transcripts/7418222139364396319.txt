Real life as a homeschool mom. I stay up way too late reading a book, and I am tired. Very tired. I just took a shower to hopefully wake myself up. Sitting in my bed drinking coffee, and my kids are making themselves. At this point, it's brunch and trying to get myself together to go do our lessons for the day. I'm gonna get there, but I'm tired.
