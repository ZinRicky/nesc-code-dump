hold my teeth we're gonna talk about this hello I'm Aria I'm a tradwife I've been married for four years and let me tell you the two reasons why I think tradwives make food that doesn't really look that great first off most of us are married to blue collar men and as a generalization I'm not saying every blue collar man is like this blue collar man like their casseroles and their canned green beans I know this is true for my husband because whenever I make him a casserole or make him something in a gravy like beef stroganoff sort of thing he loves it it might be the ugliest food I have ever seen in my whole life but he loves it and it goes on the list of we're making this again my husband is okay if I make like fancier foods or like international stuff but it really does not go on that list of making this again because it's a family favorite the second reason is this is not true for me but I suspect it's true for a lot of us tradwives is that we were not raised in a traditional household and we were not taught how to cook so a lot of us are just out here trying to teach ourselves learn from YouTube Pinterest whatever and just winging it and we don't know how to plate food and we're just we're trying our best so those are the two reasons why I think that trade wives don't make like fancy food let me know what you think in the comments
