You ever just look at your man and you were like wow, you are just God's gift to this world! you're so special and so funny you always make me laugh you always make me smile You cannot tell me that men are not the best gift from god. I should preface not all men, but some men are truly so special. They just have that golden retriever energy. They're logical, smart, usually positive, and can just brighten up any room. Theyâ€™re just Yin to our Yang, and I appreciate men for this because women often give off black cat energy. But when you find a man who's a golden retriever, then you guys get to enjoy life. If you have a man who gives off golden retriever energy and is always brightening your day make sure you tell him how much you appreciate them! Because I don't think they get enough credit, Love men, they're the best.
