in a leftist political landscape that is rife with main character syndrome you would think that more people would love being the only person in a room wearing a mask I thought y’all loved being the main character I thought y’all loved being the main character I thought y’all loved virtue signaling I thought y’all loved showing off your politics look at me look at me I'm a good person so why not put on a mask it's like the easiest cheapest way to signal your virtues and it actually helps people it actually does something so why are we not seeing it I think it's because it actually does something actually I think it's because masking actually immediately improves the world around you and that's why people feel so overs to it because it reminds them that there's an actual problem even if you're actively contributing to the solution right does that make sense
