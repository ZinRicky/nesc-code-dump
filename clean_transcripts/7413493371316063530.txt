no because I agree with you it is kind of crazy when you start to think about it and really sit with the information that we have because I do have the opinion and again just an opinion that the white beauty standard is rooted in pedophilia so when you think about the standard western white beauty standard you're talking about a woman of generally small stature hairless body blonde hair blue eyes and then when you take it a step further and you think about the things that have been sexualized or are sexualized within our culture with and within the beauty standard it also kind of tracks things like schoolgirl uniforms or pigtails like why do waitresses put pigtails in when they wanna make more money because men find pigtails attractive and pigtails are also childlike the entire anti aging industry is geared towards women because the things that signify aging in women um actually in all people wrinkles grey hair sagging skin these things are seen as negatives to the beauty standard for women where they are not seen as negatives for men there comes a point in a woman's life and a lot of my older friends have said this that they will stop being considered attractive or hit on by the general population simply because they have aged out even for men within their peer group these are not men who are looking for women to have children with these are men who are of their age group who are still preferring women decades younger than them there's an entire section a very popular section of adult entertainment that is titled barely legal because if it were legal they would be watching the real thing countless women I know have all commiserated over the fact that the most cat calling and male attention that they get is from starts around age 12 and usually caps off before their frontal lobe is developed signs of true womanhood are seen as negatives in women things like pubic hair things like um excess fat on their bodies things like stretch marks or wrinkles or grey hairs and you could argue that those are inherently unattractive and I would agree with you if we felt the same way about men which we don't now this is not to say that every man who prefers women with blonde hair is somehow attracted to children that is a large leap to make and is in fact an extremely inflammatory one because what I'm discussing is an observation about the white beauty standard and how we came to find certain things preferentially attractive this point they are so subconsciously ingrained that that just is the way it is and if you don't peel back the layers and wonder why it is the way it is you could simply say oh well people look prefer blonde but why when blonde hair is predominantly found in children and very rarely naturally found in adults only about 2% adults have blonde hair why are we having a beauty preference for a trait that is most commonly found in children why are we stripping body hair from our bodies to be as hairless as possible when we know body hair is a sign of sexual maturity and aging these are the questions that we should be asking ourselves I'm not accusing any individual men of having these sort of preferences but I am observing something about the general beauty standard and the male gaze as it pertains to the white beauty standard and I think we all should be having these conversations
