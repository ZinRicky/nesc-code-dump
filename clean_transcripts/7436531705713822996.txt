if I had to write the story of my life today it would be a very simple story centred around a main character who has to clean all of the things over and over every day until the end of time and today's narrative would be written much like the rest of them if I'm honest except plot twist there's a shining new love interest in the form of Ecostoreâ€™s Refill Concentrates and the new protagonists are benevolent and extremely easy to use just pop them in a clean sprayer bottle add 450ml of water and you're away doesn't even need to be an Ecostore bottle if you don't have one side note and totally unrelated but is it obvious I've been disassociating a little bit much on cleantok & booktok lately? anyway I've just got the kids out of my hair I mean off to school and every weekday morning around here looks much the same I like to try and take a quick 30 first thing to reset the house no matter how busy the day ahead is looking it sets me up for a productive day and I get a few blissful hours where I'm not surrounded by total chaos which really helps with the old headspace I've hit the kitchen with the Ecostore multi-purpose cleaner which smells really good and is antibacterial I dressed the table which deludes me into believing that I've actually got my life together before tackling the console which is collecting dust as if it's going out of fashion then I swapped to a clean microfiber cause that one was toast and also so I could tackle the mirrors with the Ecostore glass cleaner for a streak free finish I did the mirror in the dining room and the bathroom before switching to the antibacterial bathroom cleaner for the rest of the surfaces okay so I've been using this range for my entire adult life which feels like a really long time actually but they do make really effective environmentally conscious products and they're also constantly innovating these concentrates are just as good as a full size bottle but they reduce plastic waste by 90% and they're cheaper find them at your local supermarket and let me know what you think!
