This is the mattress that I got from the TikTok shop. It's the 14 inch queen. And this part of the mattress has coils. This part is like memory foam or gel. It's like a cooling gel so you don't get super hot. As you can see from the tag, it's made in Korea. It is really high quality, a really, really nice bed, and really helps with back pain and just comfort overall when you're sleeping. So link right here in the TikTok shop. You might need to get new sheets because it is a big ass bed, but it's absolutely worth it.
