we slowly starting to defrost here in the Southern Hemisphere which means our Father's Day is right around the corner and I'm planning on hosting a Father's Day brunch out here but not while my patio looks like this and I don't know if it's just cause emotionally I'm really ready for some warmer weather but lately I've been feeling that spring cleaning energy possessing me if you wanna give the father figure in your life and not so subtle hint to get cleaning might I suggest a Karcher for Father's Day I highly recommend their range of water blasters and also as someone who's renovating another idea is the wet and dry vacuums you can plug some power tools directly into it so if you're sanding, for example it will extract all of that dust and bag it before it has a chance to get into literally every corner of your house and that one feature has saved my sanity more than a few times anyway it always horrifies me how filthy the exterior of a house can get in winter if you've been following along on our renovation journey you'll know that this patio isn't even a year old And surprisingly this isn't even the first time that I've cleaned it but a side effect of being alive that they don't tell you is the sheer amount of admin you'll have to do just to stay on top of all of the jobs but one thing I've learnt in my 33 years on this planet is having the right tool for the job makes life so much easier I cleaned the tiles with the paver attachment and gave the furniture a once over and now the space is looking brand new again ready for some Father's Day festivities
