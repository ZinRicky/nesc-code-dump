if someone doesn't love themselves then I take it upon myself to love them even more to show them that they are worthy of love they are worthy of kindness they're worthy of being treated well that's that's the way that I operate in this world right so my Assumption is let's say I do see someone who doesn't value themselves I will value them enough for the both of us that's the way that I move through the world I think all human beings are inherently worthy of value in love but hey you don't have to agree that being said are you not tired are you not tired of this rhetoric that just because someone exists in a fat body they don't value themselves you don't know anything you don't know anything about the person's life you don't know anything about the way you feel about themselves like I value myself very highly some may say too much I don't know how you choose to live your life but I choose to live my life with kindness with care for my fellow people for myself I think there's a lot of value in that and just because you view me in a way that is not inherently of value does not mean that that's the reality I suggest looking inward thinking more about the way that you treat other people and maybe learning to value yourself a little more maybe learning the inherent value of people instead of commenting on strangers posts because if you're not living in a kind way it seems like you're the one that doesn't value yourself
