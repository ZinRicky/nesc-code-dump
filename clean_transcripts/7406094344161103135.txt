okay so I'm confused about anna marie tendler and how she has she's basically getting woman’d right now right like getting woman’d if I'm not mistaken means everyone really loves a woman and has empathy with her and identifies with her but then overnight we all hate her right that's what's happening to anna marie tendler ever since the release of her memoir Men Have Called Her Crazy and I haven't read the memoir I'm probably not going to I don't know what the drama is with the celebrity book club memoir people though I get the sense that they hated the memoir and maybe a lot of the hatred toward anna marie tendler was spurred on by this podcast I don't know but there are a couple things about the discourse and the way that people have talked about it that is really concerning I think most of the criticism of the memoir has been relatively fair like they you know she's obviously like kind of annoying and tone deaf in her memoir from what I'm getting but what concerns me is the fact that 1 our compassion and our empathy for women who have been victimized by men is very dependent upon how likeable and respectable she is and 2 mental health if we want people to talk about mental health I think we need to allow people to be honest and talk about their mental health without any kind of like expectation that they be the perfect victim especially women who have become very mentally ill as a result of men um it's like women and mentally ill people cannot really talk about their struggles and their experiences without earning the respect of the audience by giving them this like happy ending or giving them this like toxic positivity like ending or like upward trend of like oh I've suffered so much but I have grown and become a better stronger person because of it like sometimes you really are just living in your my year of rest and relaxation era and like sometimes you really are just like suffering and struggling so much and I think it's such a sign of how uncomfortable we are with our own feelings and our own mental health that we are willing to very quickly turn on people who again just talk about mental health in a way that we don't view as respectable and the last thing that I've noticed is that not only has the script flipped on anna marie tendler it's also flipped on john mulaney I've seen people say that all of a sudden they empathize with john mulaney now that they've read anna marie tendler’s memoir and they've decided that she's narcissistic and insufferable and problematic and all that like it's one thing to lose a bit of respect or likeability toward anna marie tendler after reading her memoir I'm really really confused about what john mulaney did to earn your compassion back after the release of a memoir that doesn't even mention him at all like you just decided that you hate this woman and because you don't like her anymore all of a sudden you're cool with the guy that you hated because you used to like her like I really hate that I really don't like that
