ladies it is okay if you do not love keeping house let me explain I never post in the morning so I was gonna just do a little live update just made my mushroom coffee it's to die for I put butter and raw milk in it thank me later anyway I don't think a woman has to love keeping her my husband and I have gotten an argument about this before I am one of those that likes to clean it one or two times head to toe and then yes you have to try to maintain it but the things that I don't love is like the two things of dishes I do every single day the load of laundry I do every single day the piling up of clean clothes cause I absolutely abhor putting up clean clothes I can wash laundry all day long but I know everyone agrees with me that putting them up is just it should be illegal hi honey I need you to stop okay so he growls now like an animal you're an animal hi baby what you doing are you waking up waking up my 3 major absolutely terrifies me sometimes cause he can be a little mean no mommy close the door no it's me daddy's working do dishes who feeds you okay thank you you're welcome no let's go see baby brother for the life of me I don't know why people are so scared of raw milk like it logically doesn't even make sense if you eat anything about it okay no a word listen to him oh my god honestly if my landlords were smart we would need a pet deposit for both of them it's the constant cleaning of the playroom and the mat everyday I clean it and then 10 minutes later it looks like a bomb went off again and it's frustrating and you have to remember that you live in a lived in home it would be different if you're dropping your kids off at school or daycare or you're out of the house shopping and the house doesn't get touched I have to explain that sometimes to my husband you're getting crazy and y'all know what I mean you have to explain that like listen an hour ago if you would come home it was spotless but we lived in it since then so now it doesn't look spotless and that's okay because we need to start practicing moms that maybe don't have a spotless house all the time but are not burnt out and depressed and overwhelmed I wish more than anything that I could show my kids
