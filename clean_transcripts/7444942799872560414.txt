Good men do not get enough credit so heres a list of all the green flags in men starting off with No. 1- if he makes good eye contact men who aren't afraid to hold eye contact with you and you can stare into their dreamy eyes and they reciprocate that same energy back that is a huge green flag! No. 2- has basic manners he's polite he knows to say please and thank you he's nice to others especially service worker and he holds the door open for you that is a true gentleman No.3 he laughs or smiles a lot he's generally just carefree if he can lighten the mood with a joke or he's high energy and giggling then that is a huge green flag 4 he ask you personal questions about yourself it's not just surface level it means he's genuine and he just wants to get to know you on a deeper level No. 5- when a man doesn't rush you when men let you live at your own pace usually means they're chill and they go with the flow and they know when to compromise No. six- when he matches your energy if you can be weird around him and he matches that same energy back and is as equally weird that's a huge green flag when he allows you to be yourself and he shows his playful side with you
