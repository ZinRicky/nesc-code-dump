a fashion of a time has always been able to tell us more about the social climate of that time I did an article with the Wall Street Journal about a year and a half ago now about the resurgence of this 1950s traditional housewife look and I don't think the original point of the article was to be political but it goes without saying that there are certain undertones and implications of dressing with a 1950s aesthetic that many of us who choose to be influenced by that time period of fashion are very aware of which is why you see hashtags like vintage style not vintage value and I saw a brilliant video this morning from my friend on here Peyton Dale who's a stylist who's talking about the resurgence of 1990s fashion and bimbo core and what that could potentially mean for our social climate now because those of us who live through it know how tied together the fashion of the time was with how like women were seen and feminist values were heard and those who weren't there for it it wasn't good and I think if we're gonna go back to these sorts of styles it's very important to push the messaging of style not value system no way that I have felt a profound responsibility to do on my platform because at first glance I know what sort of subtext dressing hyper feminine 1950s inspired can portray and I think that has almost spurred me on to be more vocal about my beliefs on this app because I don't want anybody falling on my page and getting it twisted and it is concerning to me even somebody who does like these fashions that 1950 style dressing may come back into more of a style simply because of the political and like social climate that it's coming back in it goes hand in hand with this sort of trad wife movement as well but this is your reminder that fashion is and has always been political but we need to be aware of like why certain trends are coming back cause nothing is ever on accident
