this is my 1950s chamber stove and today I'm gonna replace some of the safety catches on the gas burners that have lost the trim chambers was an iconic American family company that used to make gas stoves their stove design is very unique and it has a lot of chrome pieces on it and over the years chrome does start to fail it starts to the metal underneath will start to rust through the chrome plating so hence this way the most touched area of the stove was these safety gas catches the chrome started to break away from them so I switched them out with some new ones I found on eBay as this was way cheaper than sending off my small pieces to get re chromed I might do that in the future with a few other pieces but right now uh the rest of the stove looks pretty good they just don't make them how they used to this stove has been cooking meal since 1950 and it is still going strong these are the daisy burners lighting they light from the pilot light in the centre of the stove through the flash tubes
