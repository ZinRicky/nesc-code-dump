I mean maybe but like odds are it probably won't because if you hate yourself when you're fat and you lose weight you're probably still gonna hate yourself after I think countless people talk about who have undergone that weight loss but didn't do the internal work because they thought losing weight would make themselves feel better when they were just new things to hate about themselves if you don't do the work and if you don't learn to love yourself as you are in whatever position you are whatever way you are you're never gonna learn to love yourself and skinny or fat you're gonna hate yourself regardless there are literally dozens dozens of grown people who are constantly making videos of me and other fat creator who went through the process of losing weight who have so much hatred for themselves and for other fat people that they literally dedicate their life to making fun of and talking shit about fat people there is no shortcut to self love it took me years to get to a point where I was comfortable in my own body I was able to look at myself in the mirror and be happy about what I saw to get to a point where every single day my thoughts weren't consumed I'm away and how fat I was and how much I didn't like myself and it just happened overnight we live in a really fatphobic society society that teaches us to constantly nitpick about what we look like and hate ourselves and hate our bodies and hate everything about ourselves but I did the work I I did the work and now I love myself I'm a fat person who loves myself who's confident and happy in my body and I'm surrounded by thin people who do not feel the same way maybe you would love yourself more if you weâ€™re skinny but that's not the only thing that you need to do and it's not gonna happen if you don't do the work regardless of your size
