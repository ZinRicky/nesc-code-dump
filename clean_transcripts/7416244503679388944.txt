have you ever been craving something so you make it and it just hits exactly how you hoped it would? because this spiced pumpkin ginger and turmeric soup just slapped me in the face in precisely the right way I started by sauteing some onion and garlic over a medium heat in some oil before adding some curry powder some cumin, garam masala and ground coriander saute that for a minute or two before adding some fenugreek seeds some cardamom pods fresh ginger and fresh turmeric and a bit more oil cause why not I put that all into my Ninja Foodi alongside half a pumpkin about 2 cups of veggie stock and half a can of organic coconut milk and then I turned it on to the smooth soup setting and like yes I could make this in a pot and then just blend it afterward but why would I when this can do it all for me? and I know I've been banging on about how spring is here but it turns out here in Aotearoa New Zealand where I'm from which is not Australia by the way spring is a ruse, and it's actually still fkn freezing and after what felt like a long 30 minutes of waiting my soup was finally ready I garnished it with some coconut milk fresh coriander and served it with sourdough and honestly I could eat this everyday
