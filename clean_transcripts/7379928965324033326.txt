as a leftist a core tenant of my belief system is supporting people who belong to marginalized groups right so if you were part of a group who has been systematically disenfranchised chances are I'm on your side right so color me surprised when all this conversation has been happening about Israel and Palestine and all these people who claim to be leftists who I thought believed in you know anti colonialism and like revolution and like supporting oppressed people called me surprised when all over my Instagram I'm just seeing people stay with Israel and it's just like do you understand what you were doing and what you were saying because I really don't think that you do um and I understand that this is an issue that has a lot of propaganda and it has a lot of people that you respect spreading misinformation um a you can support Jewish people and not support the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people I don't know when that became a controversial thing but it's not like just because you love and support Jewish people does not mean that you also have to support what's happening and what Israel is doing to Palestine right and let me make it clear it is what Israel is doing to Palestine this is not a fair fight you know what I mean like none of this is fair Israel is the strongest nation in the in the Middle East and has the strongest nation arguably in the world the United States backing it and its military and funding it what's happening right now with Israel and Palestine can be linked into the story of David and Goliath right but only with the caveat that god has given Goliath an assault rifle and unlimited ammunition and has taken away David's slingshot like that's what's happened that is the power imbalance here you know what I mean like I'm I'm I've been trying to like get my thoughts together on the whole situation but I'm I'm like so confused as to how everyone is falling for the propaganda and my mutual crushes and spice just made a video about it much more eloquently than I'm making right now and was talking about how scary it is how many people have fallen for this you know propaganda and like how quickly how quickly everyone has been like I stand with Israel without understanding any of the history of what has been happening and what has been done to Palestine um and I'm I'll share more eloquent thoughts on the matter later but I just want to make this video to make it very clear I stay with Palestine um and I always will because I will always be on the side of the underdog and the marginalized people it's really that simple
