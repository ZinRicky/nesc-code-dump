spend a Monday homeschooling with us in case you're new around here hi I'm Chelsea former teacher now homeschool mom to my first and second grade on Mondays math has speech therapy at 10 and we don't start our home school lessons until after so while he was doing that math was playing and I was reading a new book it is a horror thriller and I swear it is going to give me nightmares anyway today felt like the first normal day of homeschooling we've had in a really long time I teach math and reading on different days so I'm able to go more in depth with each course subject and today's reading lesson was so good they Learned new rules plus they got so much extra practice on skills we've already Learned the more you practice the more likely they are to master that skill and when it comes to reading and math master is the goal so I don't move on from a skill until they've mastered it I will introduce them to new skills but we are not moving on from old skills until it is mastered I like to have a lot of hands on activities and games for them to practice those skills this week that's the floss rule for Maverick and Magic E rule for Madison and honestly Madison has already almost mastered this skills so we're gonna move on pretty quickly cause a lot of early readers have the magic e words I had to teach this before it came up in our curriculum so we just did some extra practice today and the next day we'll move on this is just an example of why you use your curriculum as a tool not the end all be all of your homes because there is a chance you might have to teach something before it comes up in your book or your child might not be ready for something when it comes up that is why you are the boss of your home school
