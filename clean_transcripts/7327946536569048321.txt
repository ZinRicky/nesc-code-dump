I don't know about you out in the sun and please don't come for me for my dinner of choice okay books and that's not a flex like I could obviously I cleaned this puppy because I wanted to except I'm hungry so I could always do my skincare in peace Granted I am making sure I'm doing I know I can just about feel your eyes rolling every step on my ideal list of things to do in the evening and there were so many things that i wanted to do behind the scenes have been cycling washing yourself without hearing the word ‚Äúmum‚Äù once you know that nights like this are started out with a little read of my smutty book anyway I cleaned and restocked my anti-anxiety station I sprayed my mood mist but full transparency or if it's just part of the human experience and this is a sort of food that I can't make when the family is here compare to the feeling of fresh I don't get very many nights where I get to tick them all off except maybe having a whole evening to read my book problematically addictive my personality is we don't know her followed by a solo swim because it turns out the grind doesn't stop even if the kids aren't here and so far this year I've read five there is absolutely no in between and I will tell you the feeling of cooking and because normally I am never uninterrupted in this bathroom no fresh room feels fresh without fresh sheets honestly so I'm really enjoying that put my lip balm on I think this room is finally ready for clean with a clean cleaning machine fkn insufferable I kind of half assed it and it was good enough I've always loved to read I don't know much took my BraveFace line dried sheets so I suppose I‚Äôd better fix me some girl dinner so if you wanna start a little Brits book club with me let me know my clean kitchen is unsurpassed privacy? but this moment is a freaking monumentous moment on its own my husband has finally figured that out I don't know if it's because I'm 32 and made my room feel all fresh I will either do literally nothing or I will do fkn everything I don't need much to be happy but I do know that very few things in this life Did my hand care and I tell you by the way I've read all of these books so far this year and I don't know who's gonna end up more traumatised I wanted to feel clean me to rot in I slept like a bloody log ü™µ and oh my goodness plus the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo I've been craving this for so long and then surprise surprise took my mushrooms but until I put a second bathroom in this house I'm walking around opening every cupboard and as rare as hens teeth but I promise this clean was just for me if you're a parent and just not enough time to do them because he took the kids away for the evening and of course we had two bathrooms at our old house it's the little things for me honestly but am I gonna make two dinners? and my goal was to make sure I read a book month this year but I feel like there are so many steps in between me but all work and no play makes me that's just demonstrating how I ended up cleaning and I think after 12 long years every drawer just saying like UGH üëπ because if I'm gonna be hanging out in this room tonight and actually getting into bed absolutely not off camera by this experience me or the kids anyway
