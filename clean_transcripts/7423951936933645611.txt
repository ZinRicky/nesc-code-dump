Gisele Pelicot is a hero she fought to make her assaults public she wanted the public to look at it straight in the eyes I love this shame she said must change sides from the victims to the perpetrator if you're unaware of this Frenchwoman's story and the trial that's been ongoing in France her husband for years drugged her and assaulted her and then invited over 50 men to come over and do the same and he filmed them and she fought to have these videos and photos shown to everyone in the courtroom so that the perpetrators would have to sit and shame while everyone watched what they did I can't begin to fathom what she has gone through and what she continues to go through and then to take it a step further that through all of this she's still thinking of others like has used this as an opportunity as she said that to show the world that we can shift shame from from the victims to the perpetrators as it should be she is my hero
