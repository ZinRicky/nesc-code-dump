I can't believe this has to be said but fathers do not comment on your daughter's bodies like either to them or to strangers last night we went to go see a play put on by my daughter's camp it was the whole camp it was all of these girls and I was sitting next to this couple they were super lovely like they were just the nicest people ever except for one comment that the dad made at the beginning of the play he pointed out which one was his girl cause I was like oh who's your daughter like we started chatting it was great pointed her out she's up there in her costume she's playing the lead role by the way he looks at her costume and he goes yeah that's a little too tight isn't it and his daughter is bigger boned like him and my dad but she's 13 and I couldn't help but think if you saying like comments about how ill fitting her costume was or how like she looked to me a stranger he met fourteen seconds ago my heart just like instantly broke for her because I'm like I wonder how many of those little like jokes her dad makes or like comments to her face and you might be saying oh he was just talking about with the fact that it wasn't like a no no that's not how we meant it so dads don't do that or at least don't do it to me
