I can't find the exact comment, but somebody's asked me multiple times what products I use for my curls. I've posted the video of how I do my hair, and then these are the products I use. This the curl cream I use. It's by Pacifica. Pineapple Swirl Curl Defining Cream by Pacifica. This is the first thing I use on, like, really wet hair. Then this is the mousse that I really like, the Pantene Soft Curls Shaping Mousse. This is the mousse that I use. Like, I posted the video. And then if I really wanted to hold and I really wanted to be this curly, I finished with the not your mother's curl talk. These three. These are the only things that get my hair to look like this.
