I'm actually in the airport so this is the perfect time for me to answer this cause the long and short of it is no you're not because in reality the only thing you're entitled to when you fly is to get to your destination safely now I totally agree that kids are learning standards of behavior in public but they are little people they are not full people yet they are learning how to full people you have Learned how to full people so you have more control over your reactions and over your big feelings some people never learn how to big people well actually but most of us figure it out but while we are teaching these little people how to big people a little bit of understanding they don't have the same control as you would go a long way and that their parents don't hear them screaming either but just as you cannot control your disappointment in being in a loud flight they cannot control their screaming you know when you voluntarily enter the public sphere you are going to be surrounded by the public and that includes people of all ages and all cognitive and physical abilities so my suggestion is if you do not want to be around the public or you would like a more curated travel experience that you should indeed travel privately because most parents try the best they can
