Just walked out the builder grade shower head for this new one on TikTok. It's pretty impressive. It's got some cool settings on it. A little knob in the back to switch them out, so. Okay, it's got more power than I was expecting. Pretty sure I can shoot the roof on this, but, um, the wife will be mad at that, so check it out.
