These elderly Swiss women sued the government for not doing enough to fight climate change n one almost nine years ago. In 2016, a group of Swiss women aged 64 and older formed an organization to fight for their fundamental right to life and health in the face of the climate crisis. In 2020, the group of more than 2,000 women sued the Swiss government at Europe's highest human rights court for failing to act to reduce carbon emissions. The women argue that the governments in action violated the rights of elderly women who are particularly impacted by heat waves caused by climate change due to their age and gender. On Tuesday, April 9th, the court ruled in favor of the women, finding that the Swiss government had failed to comply with his duties to fight climate change and cut emissions. This is the first time that a human rights court has ruled that protecting people from the effects of climate change is a basic human right. Switzerland must now revise its climate targets and policy to take greater action to cut emissions. The verdict, which cannot be appealed, also serves as a legal president in Europe for people to sue their governments over climate inaction. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg celebrated the victory with the women, saying it is only the beginning of the journey towards achieving climate justice. Speaking after the rolling, the women said they were not doing this for themselves, but for the sake of their children. And their children's children. Follow for more stories from around the world.
