I’m so happy that people are finally waking up to the idea that staying at home having traditional values, cooking, cleaning being feminine, wearing dresses brings you in your feminine energy Because for so long we've been taught by feminists that we're not allowed to want to have a simple life to want to take care of our family or home We’ve been told to try and girl boss be a boss When there’s nothing wrong with wanting a simple life and enjoying your feminine side. So I'm glad that people are finally opening their eyes  to the true, pure joys of life.
