I got this new necklace and I have not added a new necklace to like my vibe in so long and I just cleaned it I am so obsessed with it also if you've never gotten vintage sterling silver I cannot tell you how satisfying it is to clean the gunk off of vintage Sterling silver in another life I think I definitely worked with Sterling silver like either I was jeweler or as a cleaner or something cause I do that a lot in my free time cause it's really fun I love silver this is what it looked like when I bought it do you see how like black and like dirty this necklace is like I love it but it's like black and dirty and like oxidite also I spent $63 on it which is like a little bit much but it is 53 ounces of silver a heavy necklace in the way that I gauge whether or not I should buy Sterling silver also I don't know if this is right but this is my like biggest silver purchase it's $200 it was 400 leva (for my 22nd birthday) I got in Bulgaria translates $200 and this is 64 ounces of Sterling silver to be fair it is I think like hand apparently it's like hands made so that also makes it more expensive but since this was 64 ounces for $200 this being 53 ounces for $63 feel like was a good deal also now that it's clean look how good it looks anyways also I realized on the days that I wanna show more cleve I have to wear less necklaces cause they kind of like they all just sit sit here and interrupt on vibe you know them tryna I also got these from Arizona that's my new jewelry
