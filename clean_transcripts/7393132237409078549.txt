I'm a stay at home work from home mum and one of my favourite ways to start the day is by setting a bit of a vibe in the house we live in an almost 70 year old mid century home and some rooms are naturally quite dark so I like to pop some soft lighting on maybe a record and choose a piece of art for the TV cause she's an older home she does seem to get a bit cold so Iâ€™ll run the heat pump at least once a day and clean up any crumbs that I find left behind from the kids breakfast at this point of the day it's usually time for my second coffee to fix myself some breakfast and sit down to my admin I've been a customer of Powershop since we lived in our first house six or seven years ago now and part of my weekly admin routine is to play the Power Game I think I have an app for pretty much everything but this one is doing the most because it allows me to take control of my power and understand what we're using month by month day by day or even hour by hour there's five of us in this house and despite my best efforts I would say we are a high use power family so I find it extremely helpful to be able to browse the shop and save money on Powerpacks which are discounted packs of power I can also pick up a Future Pack so that's buying power at a discounted rate for months still yet to come I really enjoy buying my power weekly because it keeps me mindful of our usage and it means that I get stung with a big bill at the end of the month and every time I open the app it tells me how much I've saved which motivates me to save even more and if you're thinking about making the switch Check my link below and you'll save $150 off your first 12 months and it's basically girl math
