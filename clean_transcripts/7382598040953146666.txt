listen to this my baby daddy the last couple months has repeatedly try to come on to me in person and via text should I tell her you need the new girlfriend or just leave it she has me blocked because he's convinced her I'm just crazy and it continues she tried to warn her in the beginning of the relationship but the girl didn't wanna believe her blocked her and so since you already tried to warn her once like is it worth it to try to warn her again I don't think so she's not gonna listen to you he's gonna tell her see see how she's trying to get in our relationship now she's making sure I'm not trying to get with her are you kidding me I left her she's the one texting me she's trying to cover her he will fill her with so many lies make you out to be now you're obsessed with him and she will just get even more infuriated with you and it will just cause her to be even more obsessed with proving him he's trying to create a competition he's triangulating you three he's up at the tippy tip top and he's keeping the two of you below him and as far away from each other as possible because that way he controls everything he controls everything has to go to him and through him and so no it is absolutely not worth it telling her ignore him don't interact with him just fucking shut it down the only shit you respond to is this shit regarding your children that is necessary like I'll pick them up at 4 you know vacation starts next Friday you know what school that shit that's all you communicate about because you don't have anything everything is dead except for the connection you have for the children that's it and that's how you treat the relationship but don't even do not bother telling her absolutely not no way no way
