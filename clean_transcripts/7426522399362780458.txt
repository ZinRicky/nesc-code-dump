something we got to talk about so I know that there are some men in my comments that are truly disgusting and infuriating right like I'm talking the abortion is murder keep your legs shut crowd and I'm here to remind you that about 80% of the country supports abortion access I'm talking Republicans and Democrats alike so it's not always the best use of your time to be arguing and getting in these common debates as much as I love the engagement right I selfishly love that but it's not the best use of your activist energy to be engaging with them because they represent a really small extremist portion of the country we don't need their votes you don't need to win them over this is Lily she's cwazy focus on sharing accurate information focus on talking to people who you think might not be registered focus on people who you think wanna learn about this issue remember in every state where abortion has been on the ballot where voters have had a direct chance to vote on the issue even in red states abortion access has succeeded it is what voters want but if you wanna debate with Chad in my comments for two hours that's fine too
