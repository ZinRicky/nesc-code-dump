hear me out I think we all have some areas in our lives where we're a little bushy and for some of us it might be more than one but we all have at least one do I care about fashion not really do my clothes fit the latest trends nope do I have name brand anything probably not is my house aesthetically pleasing no do I drive a brand new car also no but you know what I do have a membership to the local mobile detailing company because it is 10:00am and already 100 degrees and I am not about to go sweat my butt off just to clean out my car but my car is getting cleaned on this beautiful and very hot Thursday
