Yes. Here is an update on the mattress. I handed it to my daughter. I still have it. Here it is. It is still holding up. I don't have any complaints about it. My boyfriend moved in with me and so we are using his mattress. And so I gave this one to my daughter and instantly laying in it, I wanna take a nap in it. I have not had any issues with it. I still really love it. She still really loves it. And. Yeah. So, yeah, there you go.
