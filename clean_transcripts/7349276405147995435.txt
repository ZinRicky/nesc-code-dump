Gut health is so important to me, which is why I started taking SEED a few years ago. This is the seed DSO one sinbiotic. Started looking into gut health when I struggled with having eczema. So I had really bad eczema for a few years, and one of the things that I knew was gonna help was figuring out my gut health. So then I looked into taking probiotics, and I found SEED, which is actually a pro and prebiotic, made such a difference in how my gut feels, which impacts my skin health as well. It also comes with this little travel size. I'm not traveling anytime soon, but when I do travel, I pop some of these in there, and it's so easy to take. I just take two capsules in the morning before my breakfast, and that's about all I do. This DSO one symbiotic has impacted my gut health so much, so if you're looking for something, it's definitely worth looking into. I could not go a single day without using this.
