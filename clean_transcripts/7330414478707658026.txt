I got that face tracking 360 degree tripod from the TikTok shop and it's cooler than I thought it was first of all this little thing comes off the bottom so you can attach it to your own tripod or like a selfie stick I didn't realize that this part adjusts so when you put your phone in it camera it's super easy to get your device in there and then it can be at an angle also this part adjust the sensor for your height or if you're like sitting or standing so and it goes all the way 360 degrees so no matter what you're doing this thing will track you and follow you so it's even cooler than I thought it was and I'm annoyed it took me so long to buy it so you should buy one right now the link is right here
