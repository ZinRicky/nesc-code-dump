the dependant I never asked for is celebrating a birthday today and because I'm mum to everyone including sometimes my husband unfortunately that means today I've got to give my furriest child the best day ever Goldie's turning 3 today and even though she's pretty easy to please I do still feel compelled to make a fuss mainly because my children have emotionally blackmailed me into doing it and also cause if I tried to run away she can easily just catch me so I'm fkd although the timing could be a little bit better if I'm honest I'm heading down to Wellington for an event tomorrow and I have a lot to do before I take off on my trip gotta run some errands clean my house stock the fridge for the grandparents wax my nose apparently?? sort my outfit do my nails give myself a tan pack my bag be a parent and also put on a dog's birthday I sprinted through the shops to find some shoes and a bag to go with the dress that I'm renting found a couple of really cute tops at glassons so I picked those up as well then it was time to head to animates to get the birthday girl some presents I personally formed an emotional attachment to this octopus but I know Goldie and she will prefer a duck and the biggest rope that I can find and some pork treats because why not and I shot off to the butcher mainly because I want ingredients to make a meat cake which is as gross as it sounds and right next door there was an amazing fruit world so I grabbed a whole bunch of produce and I'm kinda kicking myself that I haven't been shopping here for the last year because they had everything if you know me and you follow me you know I don't really enjoy running errands I don't really enjoy shopping and I really don't enjoy leaving my house but I actually kinda liked it today I felt kinda good which must mean I'm approaching my follicular phase therefore I'm approaching the one week of the month where I can actually be a sane and functioning member of society and the rest of the time I cannot be held accountable for my actions Goldie was extremely happy with the ducky and while she was entertained with that it was time for me to unload everything that I got today and try and sort my fkn house out I've been craving a ginger beer for days and I don't know why but this one just hit just right I vacuumed as if my life depends on it, which it does and I was really desperate to get into full deep clean mode today but I knew that I wasn't gonna have time so I've been chipping away at it for the last few days and tell me why that's just so much more frustrating anyway I picked up the kids and then I put on one of the new tops that I bought and got myself ready for Goldie's party the meat cake came together and she was one happy lass I tell you that much olive designed Goldie's outfit of the day today and I've shared the meat cake in the previous video cause right now we have to actually make some human food we've gone for a marinated Asian chicken slaw and noodle kind of vibe and I would have really appreciated if my day ended here but no of course I had to sort out my nails and I think that's the worst thing about doing your own nails at home is because you can change them so you will? then I fake tanned packed and crashed
