so I saw a video not long ago of a person saying that they don't know if their sexual assault even counts as an assault and I didn't wanna stitch it or you know post a screenshot or anything because it's honestly just too like heartbreaking and heartrending and I I didn't wanna like capitalize on that person's trauma that way but I do wanna talk about the the topic um this is something I plan on writing about long form basically how do you know if you're allowed to call it abuse or assault I found myself asking myself that a lot um because when you realise that you've been in an abusive situation or that you've been assaulted like you know it you know it in your bones and you know it in your soul and you try to deny it to yourself that's the funny thing about abuse is that when people try to gaslight you about it and try to negate your experience the thing is is like you can't tell me anything to try and convince me otherwise that I didn't come up with myself first okay like I I was my first gaslighter I I'm the last person who wants to believe that this is true um and now that Iâ€™ve finally come to accept it and I'm trying to tell other people about it like you are like miles behind me in terms of like trying to convince myself it's not true but anyway I remember thinking like do I need to write a letter to a board of psychologists with degrees and decades of experience um asking them for permission to call it what it is um like how how does anyone decide whether or not their situation counts um and then I read some self help books that are amazing uh why does he do that by Lundy Bancroft was circulating on TikTok for a while I also read this book called Psychopath Free which is specifically about mental and emotional abuse and these doctors with degrees and decades of experience one of the first things they say is that if you feel like you've been abused if you feel like it was an assault then it probably was like that's that's the first sign that's the first symptom and it was so validating because it it's like it just reaffirms that you are the chief authority on your experiences you are the chief authority on whether or not it counts and then of course comes the question of like okay well my abuser says that I was also abusive toward him like what do we what you know what do we do about that that's a whole I can't get into that right now I'm gonna write about it long form but um I just wanna put that out there to kind of start a conversation and a dialogue on women's like authority not just women but like you know victims um trying to be inclusive of gender obviously and if anyone has suggestions on like more gender inclusive language when talking about feminism like please like let me know but um we talk a lot about women's autonomy and our right to say what does or does not happen to us but I think we need to start thinking about authority the authority to say this happened to me and the person who did this to me needs to be held accountable and faced with serious remediation
