This might ruffle up some feathers, but I truly believe to my core that if a man is willing to buy a woman an expensive gift, engagement ring. Then the woman should equally buy him an expensive gift. For example if he buys you an expensive engagement ring, then you should buy him an expensive gift. Maybe nice shoes, suit, a classy watch. Youâ€™re likely able to get him all of these things, and it probably still won't be as expensive as a ring is these days. I don't know, what do you guys think?
