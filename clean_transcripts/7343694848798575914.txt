if you are staying for the kids and they're not even yours here's your permission to just fucking leave if you're somebody that's dating a single parent and you think oh gosh I can't leave him I need to stay for the kids or I can't leave her I need to stay for the kids have a little talk because I think you're inflating your position in those children's lives probably because the parent inflated your position in those children's lives and that's why you feel so important and like you should stay for the kids they're not your kids you're free to go whatever the fuck you want and those kids are not gonna be that deeply affected what is going to affect them is having a parent that puts them in these types of positions but I promise you you leaving is probably the best thing that can happen for those children cause now they can have their parent back and their parent isn't distracted with this relationship cause that's probably why the first one failed and why they're a single parent now so
