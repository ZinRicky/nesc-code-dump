I'm gonna ruffle a few teacher feathers when I say this but I don't think it's that important to teach my little kids to tell time on an analog clock yet just hear me out there is a lot of other things that come with a concept of time like an hour a minute morning afternoon night am PM those kinds of things and telling time on an analog clock it takes a lot of additional skills like skip counting and for my littles they just don't have all of those skills mastered yet so it makes telling time really difficult but I did find this time to fly game that has been so good in helping them practice those concepts and learn how to tell time on an analogue clock because it has this little airplane that helps teach them the correct time and is a self corrector so there are these little cards that have a time they have to be able to read it and make the time on the analog clock and they can play independently because this checks their time for them so if you are teaching littles to tell time or just want to practice tell time at home or in the costume time to fly is a great way to do that
