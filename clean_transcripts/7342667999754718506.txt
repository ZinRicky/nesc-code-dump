The single best piece of advice I ever got was let the dad struggle 100%. He's not gonna do it the same way you do. When I was pregnant with my first, I remember hearing a lot that moms become moms during pregnancy and dads become dads after birth. I think a lot of that is held over from this idea that a pregnant woman is somehow going to just know what to do when the baby comes out, that instincts are gonna tap in and you're just gonna be a super mom from day one. So although that can be true, that there's that instant instinct kicking, it's not true 100% of the time. What is true is that the birthing parent or mother is usually the primary parent of that infant. So even if you don't know what to do, you learn trial by fire. You are in it from day one, whereas dad might be a little bit slow out of the game. So as much as it is easy for you to just do bedtime, you to do every feed, um, you gotta let the guy struggle. There is no reason that a dad or non birthing partner is in any way less capable than the person who gave birth. And the sooner that that baby can be soothed by both of you, the sooner you guys are gonna get back to a little bit more equal playing field. And there's truly nothing better than watching Your husband becoming truly caring, capable and confident. Dad
