my husband said he was craving steak for Father's Day but I knew what he really felt like was mushroom bruschetta and being as thoughtful and obliging as I am that's exactly what I decided to make for him I started by growing some organic pink oyster mushrooms which are definitely not poisonous And then harvesting them at the peak of their maturity Not before, and not after I removed a generous handful with a pair of blunt Scissors and when I had enough it was time to tear them into sections which is another way of saying I'm still not allowed unsupervised access to knives I heated up a cast iron skillet with a generous amount of olive oil before adding in shallot chopped garlic and my mushrooms once they’d cooked down a little bit I added some balsamic vinegar some fresh thyme from the garden and salt and pepper to taste I put slices of an organic sourdough French stick on an oven tray before drizzling it with olive oil and popping it in the oven to bake and I gently heated my burrata to make it nice and oozy I made a bed of that on the toasted sourdough before topping it with my beautiful mushroom mix and I topped everything with some shredded basil leaves and some balsamic glaze these mushrooms were so easy and full of ✨ magic ✨ and I wanted to make him this instead of steak because I need him to know that I think he's a really fungi
