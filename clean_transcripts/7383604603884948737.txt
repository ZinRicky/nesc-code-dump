almost exactly one year to the day this is how this room looked this is ‘Move In Day’ and it's a very realistic move in day I feel because there is shit everywhere we moved our family of five two and a half hours away we didn't use movers because nobody wanted to come out to the small town that we lived in anyway it was a chaotic day and six months later this is how the room looked We stripped all the wallpaper prepped the walls and played around with paint and it was a vibe don't get me wrong but it just wasn't *the* vibe do you know what I mean and after a little while I realised I didn't really like it so I painted everything white just to get back to a blank canvas to see what else this room could be there's one thing about me is I'm not afraid to admit when I'm wrong I make mistakes all the fkn time but I don't sit around and cry about it okay I do a little bit but after I'm done crying about it then I'll just chip away at it until I create something that I'm genuinely happy with and honestly the synchronicities between life and renovation I cannot one thing about renovation which I feel like isn't talked about enough especially when you're trying to push yourself outside of your comfort zone and do something different case & point me coming from a very sad beige new build into a character filled mid century home which is just demanding colour is that sometimes you're not gonna get it right first time and that's okay you're allowed to try things and not like it your first choice may not be your final choice and I feel like homes grow with us so this space will eventually change with time I think what I'm trying to say is I’ve fully given myself permission to try new things and just have fun and I think you should too
