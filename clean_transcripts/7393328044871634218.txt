I think differences in parenting style can boil down to whether or not you see the child as their own autonomous whole human being or as an offshoot of your identity as the parent and usually I make this a generational thing because it is much more prevalent in generations previous for the child to be an extension of the parent but beyond parenting styles this is just how I've always believed it's how my spirituality and and my idea of the soul exists and that my children are not my property nor they an extension of me beyond maybe they're like manners and their ability to function as a human being but that's also because they're young their personality their likes their interests their potential career or choice in partners has nothing to do with me and I think this is where a lot of that parental shame comes from when parents shame their child for their lifestyle choices or their lives or their livelihoods or their partners or the choices that they make in their life or how they style themselves to present themselves to the world it has nothing to do with their children it's because they see their children as some sort of extension of them first and foremost you are my child notice the ownership of that second of all you get to be a person and this ownership of someone else's individuality is extremely problematic and comes from some pretty dark and nefarious societal structures that we can get into at another time but that's why someone else's shame or opinion about what you're doing with your life has so little to do with you and so much to do with the fact that they see you as part of them not as your own individual human being kids come through you not to you
