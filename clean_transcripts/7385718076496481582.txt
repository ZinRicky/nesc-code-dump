if you're homeschool and little ones this summer you're gonna need this this is a great way to add some busy work in between curriculum time you don't like to take a big break over summer because you don't wanna get lazy I feel like if we took a huge break over summer it'll be so hard to just take back up again and have it homeschool is part of our daily life again these books cover a wide variety of subjects we have maths we have English and we have some art skills as well this is perfect for practicing pen holding skills and perfecting your child's handwriting skills I actually ordered two of these and I didn't realise that he actually has invisible ink so the pens that are provided are the ones that you want to use we even get this little pen grips um my daughter's pretty good at already holding a pen it's something she's naturally good at but the pen grips help she likes it once the ink starts drying it disappears it's like invisible ink so that by the next day you gotta use the book again and it's all gone and you can practice again so these are totally reusable and I definitely recommend for this summer
