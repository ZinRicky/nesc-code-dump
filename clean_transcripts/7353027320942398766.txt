I don't know about y'all but men who have no chill and text you, or double text you if you take too long to respond are so attractive in my eyes. Itâ€™s adorable and it reminds me that you're thinking of me. It means you can't get enough of me. But, if you as a man are nonchalant about texting or talking to me, then bye. That means you don't care about me, so why should I care about you? In my eyes that's just not attractive.
