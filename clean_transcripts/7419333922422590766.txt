I'm making dinner right now and I just had to stop because I wanted to share this thought about Trad Wives because I'm a stay at home mom and I understand why other stay at home moms might get defensive about people kind of shitting on our lifestyle and our life choices because we enjoy this this is something that makes us happy right but the problem really comes down to not about individual happiness it comes down when people are using that happiness as a justification for stripping back other people's choices and rights so this is a lifestyle this is a lifestyle choice this is not something that would make everybody happy I talk about this being a career and a job just as much as anything else with skills and aptitudes that not everybody is going to be naturally inclined to so when you use somebody's happiness and they're visual aesthetic online to justify why women should ALL be doing this that's where the problem lies because I know that I enjoy this but I know not everybody would and aren't we all just adult humans shouldnâ€™t we be able to make our own choices with all the freedoms
