There is nothing like a breakfast sausage, but when you choose to avoid pork, your options are limited. That's why I decided to make my own breakfast sausages using 100% grass fed beef. The reason I don't like to eat pork is because it's an animal that carries a bunch of toxins, parasites, and viruses. Not to mention they're raised in factory farms where they live to bringly unhealthy lives without ever having access to daylight or pasture. Nutrient dense beef sausages are really easy to make and you can make a pretty large batch for additional meals all week long.
