okay but thank you for not making me feel stupid cause I was like it sounds gross corned beef what the fuck okay it's literally just like brine they just brine it the reason it's called corned beef from what I've Learned is because they put it um when they're gonna brine it and like whatever the fuck they put it in like a bed of like rock salt or like salt and seasonings and stuff and so those are considered the corns but it's really just beef it's just like delicious brisket that's been brined and seasoned and then cooked and then they slice it usually like decently thick it's not like roast beef or it's like super thin like deli meat it feels like fucking little bits of like yummy steak so yeah it's just fucking delicious every time I've wanted a roast beef sandwich what I really wanted was a corned beef sandwich I've avoided them for 41 years and now I'm their biggest man thank you for not making me feel stupid
