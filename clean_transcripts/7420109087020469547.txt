I had to calm myself down several times to make a response video because I kept commenting back to this person and um they kept getting taken down for bullying so first thing I wanna point out is the sheer inappropriateness of this comment to be left on that video shows a lack of tact a lack of class a lack of compassion and empathy also and this is the part that's really frustrating it shows just how willfully um you are misunderstanding any of my Tradwife content there's a very big difference between a Tradwife and a prepper being so willfully misunderstood I made me so angry mostly because you used the death and destruction of Western North Carolina and my concern for it to make this comment but beyond that if you are not sophisticated enough to understand the nuance of a complex conversation shut your mouth you don't have the skills to participate in this discussion clearly my critique of trad wife content creators has nothing to do with what's going on in Western North Carolina but beyond that do you know that there are non trad wife preppers do you know that you can make homesteading content without a sprinkle of white supremacist rhetoric would it shock you to know that I also grow vegetables and can bake bread yeah because these topics aren't black and white they have nuance and your capacity to understand that is your problem people who are educated and sophisticated enough to have this conversation understand what I'm talking about and you should have the day that you deserve and I kind of hope you pee your pants in public today
