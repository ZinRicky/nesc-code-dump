I woke up this morning trying not to panic because I've bitten off a hell of a lot to do but if I panic I won't get done so I just need to get through this day and every other day one step at a time the good news is that the days are flying by and the bad news is that the days are flying by and there's just not enough hours within them I started my day the way that I always do by raiding my anti anxiety station and doing some breath work because I think that that's the only thing that's keeping me slightly sane made a coffee checked on the pool progress snuggled my babies and then it was time to get busy with my first chore of the day and genuine question but how we keeping lunch boxes fun and exciting year round? I try to vary what I give them day to day but I think I need some fresh inspiration today we had ciabatta and plain white bread for my daughter beetroot hummus lettuce from the garden and some roast chicken and don't get me wrong I would love to get some more veggies in there but this is all that they wanted I gave them a side of fruit salad each and then for the snacks I kinda got lazy and gave them a side of pretzels mini Oreos and a gummy watch but I was running out of time at this point I finished the lunches packed the bags raced through the bathroom did some skincare forgot to turn my camera on love that for me and then into the car we went once all the babies were dropped off I raced through the shops because I needed to get some tomato plants to donate to the school and then because I think the theme of the day today must be racing and forgetting to turn my camera on I raced through the chores and only captured part of them I did a bit of email admin and then it was time to make some breakfast for my tradie I toasted up a couple bagels top that with avocado lettuce bacon and some cheesy eggs can't forget pepper and a dollop of hollandaise then I took that outside to where Mark had been working tirelessly since first thing this morning because we're not only racing the clock with this pool but we're racing the weather as well but you just can't leave an old pool empty for long cause it can cause some really major issues so as soon as we get a fine day it's all hands on deck and by all hands I mean just Mark and Iâ€™s because nobody wants to help us I picked the kids up from school made everyone some afternoon tea and my husband got a beer as part of his afternoon tea and then it was time for olive and I to head out again because she's got a piano lesson and while I was waiting for her to have her lesson I went to the florist and then the supermarket you know really fkn riveting stuff and then I got home and straight into cooking dinner I've been really loving these Cassia at home curry sauces they taste very authentic and it made dinner so quick and easy I sauteed up some chicken onion capsicum and then added the curry sauce meanwhile I had my rice cooking before frying up some poppadoms it was quick and hearty and comforting which was exactly what I needed after a long day but can someone please tell me how we're plating up rice these days? cause I still do it like it's 1989 then I hit the wall, had a shower and was asleep by 8:30 it was bliss
