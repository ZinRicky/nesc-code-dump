this comment is such a good example of the Dunning Kruger effect if you don't know what that is let me explain The Dunning Kruger effect is a cognitive bias where people with very little knowledge or expertise in a particular area are much more likely to be confident and overestimate their abilities in that area basically being uninformed leads to over confidence and then as you acquire knowledge on the subject you are more likely to become less confident because you start to realize how much there is to know about that subject and you start to realize how much you don't know so here I was talking about a very persuasive book on misogyny by Professor Kate Manne when this commenter commented to tell me that it was “nonsense” I commented back and said you should read the book and then come back and tell me if it changed your mind they confidently responded that they refuse to engage with books on this subject and that the solution is somewhere else I talk about feminism and the law on my page so the Dunning Kruger effect is always in my comments but um I wanna hear from you like what do you have an expertise in something or does this happen a lot on your page too what are you talking about tell me where you see this happening
