good men do not get enough credit so here are some green flags and good men number one if you treat his mom or sister nice huge green flag now some of you may have not known this but this should go without saying he learns to respect woman through his female family members they taught him how to treat woman or should have if he's not nice to them then we all know how he'll end up treating you so if he treats the females in his life well then that's a huge green flag No. 2 if his best friend is a guy no guy should ever have a girl best friend that's just not possible argue all you want, but it's just not and most women would never date a man who has a girl best friend it's weird number three if he works out legs even if it's just once a week he doesn't have to go crazy but if he hits all his muscle groups then it shows that he's a well rounded man huge green flag No.4 if he doesn't care about social media doesn't care about Instagram, Snapchat whatever it may be he's not seeking attention from other people bonus points if he doesn't have one at all why does he have to be following anyone? that's a huge green flag No. 5 if he drinks his coffee black huge green flag yeah he might like the occasional sip of your sweet coffee or enjoy one from time to time but for the most part real men drink black coffee I said what I said huge green flag if your man does all of these or if you're just a man and you do these!
