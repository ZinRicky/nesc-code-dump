so I'm back to tell you why out of all the chicken crab I've ever bought this has been the most useful and worth all of my money she's not full right now cause I just got done with some baking oh questions on my previous video so I thought I'd address some of them yes this is on the countertop this does not go in the refrigerator this is on top of my stove right now or on the countertop and it keeps the eggs at room temperature which is perfect for baking with these eggs are farm fresh eggs so they have not been processed so they can sit on the counter for up to two weeks does the eggs slide down and as I take eggs off you can see the eggs slide down and they rotate around yes I had duck eggs on even this little egg got stuck so yes sometimes the eggs do be kinda stuck and you just kinda like nudge them on their way down and tell them all it's such a simple divide and I'm telling you this is the best chicken crap you will ever buy there is so much useless chickens products on the market here is now before it's sold out again add to your cart now to see if you have any outstanding TikTok coupons
