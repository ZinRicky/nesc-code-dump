I only stopped binging when I started eating intuitively and I stopped dieting I know this is a troll comment because she stays in my comments however I think this is a really good opportunity to talk about how binge eating is often the result of restriction right at least for me because I grew up a a fat kid like I've always been fat I have been on diet since you know I was a child I honestly don't remember a time before I was dieting and constantly like worrying about my weight and because I grew up fat I was constantly worried about becoming bigger I grew up yo yo dieting and like in the cycle of restriction and binging and restriction and binging and being forced on these diets as a child messed up my relationship with food to a degree that I'm like I'm still recovering from I have a big sweet tooth and like sweets were such a no no growing up um and whenever I would get my hands on like chocolate or whatever instead of just like having a piece because I was craving it and then like leaving it for later I would eat the entire thing because I knew I wasn't supposed to have it I didn't know if it would be taken away from me like I I knew it was like you know fleeting right and so I would binge on that thing just like having a piece and then moving on I felt so much shame around the food that I was eating that like I just like wanted to have it and then I didn't wanna think about it and like that was one of the things that caused me to binge and then when I started being in charge of the food that I ate being control of the groceries that I bought when I ate what I ate whatever I switched from like binging to eating what my body wanted and not restricting the foods that I wanted to eat which in turn caused me to have a better relationship with food because I didn't eat from this position of like restriction because of my cycle of yo-yo dieting in my childhood I was continuously losing and gaining weight all the time and that is what caused the weight gain that I had throughout my life when I stopped dieting and I stopped restricting myself and started eating just what I wanted that is when my weight maintained since I started eating intuitively this is the first time in my entire life that my weight is the same and you don't have to believe me like I I'm what do I gain from lying though like this is this is my reality this is what happened in my life I'm not denying like I did binge eat that was something that I definitely definitely did and I don't really anymore intuitive eating is what has helped me with that that being said I think it's really interesting the way that people talk about eating disorders that result in like weight gain versus eating disorders that like make people look emaciated y'all's lack of empathy for fat people is very telling of your character
