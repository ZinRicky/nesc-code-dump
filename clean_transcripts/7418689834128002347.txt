We close our house today. It's officially ours. Is that sweat or rain? Both. So we have had the first few bands of the Hurricane come, but nothing major yet. So we're gonna do as much as we can before the Hurricane comes. And then when it does come, Logan's gonna do some of the inside work. We'll see how this goes.
