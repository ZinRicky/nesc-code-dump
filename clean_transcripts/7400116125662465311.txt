welcome to the second day of Holly Academy if you're new around here hi I'm Chelsea a former teacher and now homeschool I taught in the classroom and online for 8 years and now this is our third year homeschool my kids are in first and second grade and we are eclectic and that's just a fancy way of saying we don't stick to one homeschooling method we do a lot we do most of our learning family style and I try to make it as hands on as possible we're also doing a lot of learning journals this year which I'm really excited about I like them because I can pull resources from a lot of different places and store them in one journal sometimes I use a curriculum other times a unit study and then there are other times I just totally make my own thing I like to shake it up to keep things interesting but then we just glue it or tape it into our journal and it's all stored in one place if you like things uniformed and in a specific order this is probably not the method for you but if you lean more towards child learning I highly recommend you try out Learning Journal I really started using this method last year when our science curriculum came with a student workbook that just did not work for my kids ages we really liked the curriculum and the concept so I made a learning journal to make it work for my kids we liked it so much that we decided to do the same thing for volume 2 this year if you're looking for a literature based science curriculum check out the Sass across Science Adventure volume 1 was zoology which my kids absolutely loved and you could actually use it for geography as well I'm a big fan of thematic studies because I would rather do multiple subjects at once than have something different for every subject it's also a really great way to introduce littles to history and science and you can put it all in one learning journal do you see how easy that is homeschooling is all about working smarter and not harder if you want more homeschool tips and tricks follow all school year long I'll be sharing our daily recaps behind the scenes of what homeschooling is really like and other tips and tricks I'll show you what I'm using how I'm using it where I get my ideas from and give you guidance to help you homeschool with confidence
