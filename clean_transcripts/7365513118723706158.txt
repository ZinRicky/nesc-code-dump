okay I came to the great outdoors today to do what I do best which is rant into my phone um I wound up on John Mulaney hate TikTok last night and don't get me wrong I do hate him I think he deserves every ounce of hate that he gets but I feel like men like him get a level of hatred that I would think would be reserved for or at least used on rapists and like actual abusers we don't hate rapists and abusers as much as we hate people like John Mulaney I think a strong argument could be made that John Mulaney's behavior toward Anna Marie Tendler could be considered abusive just like I think a lot of men's behavior toward women could be considered abusive even though these women aren't saying that and that's part of my point here that I'm trying to make is that women can express their pain and their agony that men cause them and even if she's not calling him abusive I still hate that man I hate that man I want the worst for him but when women call men abusive they do use the big words here like abuse they talk about sexual assault or domestic assault um all of a sudden it's a Johnny Depp Amber Heard situation and I feel like we empathize with women up until it hits the fever pitch of being able to call a man's behavior abusive and then when she starts demanding accountability especially or she says something that definitely demands accountability be held then all of a sudden we care more about that threat to the status quo that threat to patriarchy men and women alike we don't like that threat to the status quo and all of a sudden we turn it into an Amber Heard Johnny Depp situation and again there's a strong argument to be made that men like John Mulaney are inherently abusive but because no one is saying that we're still able to empathize with Anna Marie Tendler who has expressed her pain and her agony in a way that we deem appropriate so it's a very interesting set of conditions that need to be met here in order for us to like empathize with women basically we empathize with women and we care about their pain up until they hit a point where the expression of their pain is no longer appropriate and when it's no longer appropriate that's when it's a threat to the status quo
