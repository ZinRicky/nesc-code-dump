in order to have a space that is truly inclusive that space needs to be safe for marginalized groups of people and because of that true inclusionary space must have a certain level of exclusivity in order for us basically truly inclusive I can't be letting in not sees and bigots racists homophobes transphobes ableists and on my page I will absolutely not be allowing fatphobes those people have to be excluded because people who use their free speech as a way to harm marginalized groups of people make it so that space is no longer inclusive for those marginalized groups of people so when you say that you don't morally agree with fatness I actually don't have to listen to a thing you say and I don't have to actually care about your free speech because you're objectively wrong and bigoted you are not welcome here hope this helps
