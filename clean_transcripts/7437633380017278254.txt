you will never believe the song you chose for this wegovy ad have you also trouble with your weight same discover the power of Wegovy with Wegovy I lost 35 pounds and some lost over 46 pounds and I'm keeping weight off they took this is me but instead of this is me they said Wegovy for context this is the music video what I remember of this film it was basically much people who were ostized from society they became carnies because they weren't accepted literally anywhere else people hated them and feared them because of their appearance because it looks different than everyone else right so this is a ballad about radical self acceptance like they're like I don't care if the world judges me like this is who I am I'm standing in myself like I am comfortable and I'm happy with myself this is who I am right and the person who's singing the song this is Bearded Fat Lady which you know I was eating up because I love fat representation anyways she's like this is me I'm fat this is what I look like you know owning herself so for wegovy to use this song this song in their weight loss drug ad showing people who are like talking about how they're finally happy because they're losing weight it's like you are sick I'm not even talking about wegovy itself I'm just talking about the ad that is so sinister and evil turning a self acceptance ballad into an ad for weight loss and not even just using the song but modifying it to go from this is me to Wegovy you're sick you're so sick
