here's a math tip from a former teacher now home school mom when you are teaching math like addition subtraction multiplication division you wanna teach number bonds so they can learn the relationship of those numbers and I have the perfect thing for you to start teaching this this is a dry erase number bonds board so you can practice multiplication and division it comes in a pack of 12 so you can use them to display bonds that you're working on and give your kids one so that they can practice as well
