No, I post about this thing a lot, but I really fucking love it. And I really love it because it charges my phone and then I use the second cord to charge my magnetic power bank. So that while I'm out, if my phone dies, I'm not like, fuck, I'm not at my car. I don't have to wait till my car, cause sometimes I don't know where the fuck I am and I need, like, directions now. So I've had to, like, sit in my car and wait for to charge before I can even get going. So I really fucking love this thing. And this thing. Both of these things are from the TikTok shop, so.
