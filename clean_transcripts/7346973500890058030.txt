The highlight of my week is definitely date night with Daniel. We try to go on a date once a week. We usually go out to dinner somewhere fancy ish. Tonight we went to a place in Park City. We got deviled eggs for appetizer and Brussels sprouts. The deviled eggs look like ice cream cones. Daniel got a. Well actually I got a pork chop wrapped in prosciutto. He got beef barley plate, but I ended up switching with him cause his always looks so much better than mine. Flora Joe was with us and she slept the whole time like a champ.
