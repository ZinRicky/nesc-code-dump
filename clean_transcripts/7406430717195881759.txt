You see how I started teaching women that they could create their own businesses and they don't have to depend on a man? Very cutesy, very demure. It's very businessy. Businessy, not scammy. Scammy like the MLMs and the MRRs. None of that shit. It's legitimately like me and my friend. So cutesy. Look at how damn you are. How cute. I love it. You know where the link is?
