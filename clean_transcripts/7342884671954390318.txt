if you want your man to surprise you with gifts and nice gestures, then this video is for you! now into the HOW, if you want your man to surprise you with gifts, then here's what you should do. TELL THEM, you should be like hey I really like getting surprised with flowers or chocolates, whatever it may be, tell them, “it would be nice if you'd surprise me every once in a while with them” please, state your needs okay, I know we've all been there where we are like “oh I shouldn't have to tell him what to get me” or “he should already know” “he should already know what I like, want or need” okay men are not mind readers, sometimes they truly don't know. Don’t feel bad if he doesn't instinctively know what to do, Even if you sprinkle your wants in passing, they're not always gonna know, and they're not gonna be able to catch it or read between the lines. Instead, you should state your wants and needs to them directly speak directly to them don't spiral if they don't instinctively know what you want, or instinctively understand how to meet your needs I promise you they do not love you any less don't say “if you loved me, you'd wanna do these things on your own without me having to ask” It’s simply not how it works sometimes so tell them directly what you need do not leave them guessing on what you need If you wanna build a healthy long lasting relationship, then you have to understand that you're in control of directly communicating your wants, needs and desires. Then he directly knows how to put the energy and love into your relationship And HOW he then he can put in the energy and effort to ensure that your needs are met okay that's love and that's respect You have to speak directly and tell them otherwise you're probably never gonna have your needs met.
