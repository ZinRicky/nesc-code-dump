As a mother of four, I know a good toy when I see it. This car has it all. It has a five point harness for safety and he's actually pretty fast for a small little kid's toy. My son is seven years old, but he's more the size of an eight year old. So he's very tall and he fits in this perfectly. This hits any bumps on our property, takes him like a champ. If you're looking for a ride on vehicle and you have an uneven backyard, this rides on grass perfectly. In any other terrain, sand, rocks, this actually is true four wheel drive. Look at this thing pick up some speed. I've had so much fun on this and I would recommend it to anybody.
