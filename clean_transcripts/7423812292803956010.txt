all right 15 time just started raining rainy at the first band and then it just has to rain all day we are on the dirty side of the Hurricane which means thunderstorms and tornadoes I've never been afraid of those during a Hurricane until Halloween when we literally got hit by a tornado and so that's a new fear that's unlocked so I used to not be anxious about this part of this Hurricane so now I am so it'll be fun
