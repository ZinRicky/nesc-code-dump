People don't actually understand that if you're nice to your partner, your wife, your husband, they're most likely gonna be nice to you. They're gonna be more likely to help you take out the garbage, clean the kitchen, cook for you. You ever notice that whenever you're cranky and you let it out on your partner, they're gonna return that same energy to you? Understanding your emotions and how they affect your relationship is one of the most important things in a relationship. So don't forget, if you want a happy life and a happy marriage, make sure that you're also exuding that same energy.
