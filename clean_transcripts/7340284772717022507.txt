figuring out how to get ski clothes on a child that has sensory issues might be the thing that puts me in an early grave one extra bunch one extra wrinkle one discomfort and the whole thing has to start all over again and the funny thing is I feel like this is kind of retribution for my behaviour as a child because I also had really big trouble getting dressed with sensory issues now being on the other side of it as the parent is it requires a level of patience that I did not know I had and although I love the snow and I love four season year I have never been more thankful that we live in South Carolina where you can wear pretty much T-shirt and shorts and one layer of clothing year round
