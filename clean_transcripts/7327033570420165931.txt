watch how easy it is to wipe out this dirty pan I'm literally using a baby wipe and only one hand cause I'm recording with the other hand and look like nothing was ever cooked in there and you know what I did cook in there chicken thighs greasy skin and bone in chicken thighs and they came out like nothing look at this Mac and cheese it's bubbling hot loaded with cheese I cooked it on the stove and then moved it to finish in the oven look how easy it slides out the I'm not even using two hands and nothing sticks at all nothing like brand new like straight out of the cabinet practically they're super space shaving because the handle comes off which I thought was weird but it's super easy how it clicks on and clicks off it is compatible with all of the pans so you can take it off of one put it on the other and then for especially if you have a house with little kids you can just safely set the handle off to the side so it's not like little hands are gonna grab it and be in any danger while you're cooking I that part is really amazing for me the handle is really sturdy though you can still carry the heavy hot pots over to the water to drain if you need to or use them in any other way also since it has these this clippable handle you can put things in the oven and you don't need to worry about where your hot pad is and no little hands can reach in there and accidentally grab it you just use it to pull the item out of the oven or to push it back in the oven you clip it off and again you just set it safely to the side not only that but because of the handle they stack neatly and space saving inside of each other this set is amazing the link is here to buy one
