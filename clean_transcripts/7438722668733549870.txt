my kids had a really busy weekend working with their dad so we needed a chill Monday it's really cloudy outside which makes me tired and puts me in a fight so when Madison asked to make clothes for her Barbies I said why the heck not why not start our Monday with a low stress activity if you've ever done sewing crafts with an 8 year old you know I'm totally kidding there is nothing low stress about a child using a sewing machine but she did it failed and Learned from it so I will say it was good lessons to learn on a Monday morning as for our actual lessons we can have a pretty low math Learned the N k constant team and I've been teaching these as word family we used the all about reading word cards and sorted them into the word fam and Madison kinda just did a Hodge podge of thing she reviewed the contractions we Learned last week and did a few pages of a grammar and spelling workbook that we just she doesn't love doing workbooks but I wanna see if it helps her reading fluency at this point I'm trying any and all of the things but she does really enjoy these Little Lions books and that is a win
