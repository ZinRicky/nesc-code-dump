Let's make my mom's chocolate chip cookies. You're gonna start with a one cup of shortening of your choice. I used butter, one cup of sugar, and then half a cup of brown sugar. Cream those together, which just means to mix them together. And then we're gonna add two eggs. I measure vanilla by heart, but you could probably also do 1 teaspoon. This was way more than I actually needed by accident. Mix together, and then you're gonna add one and a/2 teaspoons of baking soda. And then you're also gonna add in another one and a/2 teaspoon of salt. Slowly add in the flour. Between 2. Two and a/2 to 3 cups. If you want sugar cookies, use less flour. If you want dough or cookies, use more flour. Add in half a bag of chocolate chips. Mix that together. I'm then gonna take my handy dandy cookie scooper, and I'm going to put those on a baking sheet, pop those in the oven at 3:50 for 10 to 12 minutes, and then they will come out the most gooey, delicious cookies you have ever had in your life.
