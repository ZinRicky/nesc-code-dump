if you're in Paris the head to toe Chanel tweet that is not what they're wearing thing so no hate to this creator but I just thought this was really funny because my husband and I are going to Rome in July and literally never have I ever gone on a vacation being like I wanna blend in with the locals I want people to think I'm from Paris cause number one know the fuck they won't like I don't care how you're dressed you're not gonna carry yourself you're not gonna speak a language you're not gonna smell right they will sus you out in a second so like blending in is just preposterous unless you're like moving there but as a tourist I take every opportunity to go to a foreign country like it's a theme party it is the theme of the dressing it is not the point to look like people who actually live there at least for me now obviously I'm a fashion girly so I like to keep it elevated but it is absolutely a theme but I don't know I don't really give a fuck what I look like to other people anyway so maybe bring some of that energy
