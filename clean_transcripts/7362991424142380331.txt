Can somebody please tell me why healthcare in America is so darn expensive okay this is also a friendly reminder to be careful with new knives because I was washing them I was scrubbing them and it slipped for my little girl grip doesn't matter I sliced my arm open had to go to urgent care the ER and apparently it cost like 700 something dollars so that's great and that was a week ago they glued me shut they didn't even stitch me which I'm pretty sure I needed stitches it was that bad and then today I’m getting ready to go to the gym and the glue just falls off I'm gonna spare you the disgusting details but it opened okay so I go back to urgent care today Sunday to see if they can patch me up fix me up and they're like yeah no we can't close wounds after like 24 hours of injury It’s been a week so I'm left to just kind of figure it out they said it should just heal and scab so now I'm gonna be left with a giant scar not only that they're like you could use sterile strips to close it and I had to do that myself yeah so now I have this I didn't have Scissors to cut the tape but why is healthcare so expensive please tell me why, please Anyways I just had to get that off my chest I just finished working out so I guess I'm also curious do you have a health related injury or accident that happened that you're just like why am I now in debt I'm curious if you have injured yourself um okay I have to go the ACS is off so you can hear me so bye
