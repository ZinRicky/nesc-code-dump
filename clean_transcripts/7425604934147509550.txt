whether or not you wanna post political content on your page on social media is entirely your choice I know I don't wanna open up my page everyday and see doom and gloom because there's a lot of it there's a lot of it and sometimes we need an entertainment reprieve we need the light so as a content creator that is entirely your choice however I believe as a woman and as a mother your role in society is inherently political motherhood is political because whether or not you participate in the politics or the propagandizing of motherhood your identity is being used to further political agendas from the left and from the right and this is not a new thing society has created this entire identity around what a mother is all the way back from Mary Magdalene to Florence Henderson how we depict mothers and motherhood has always said something about how we view women and how we view the role of mother in society just why I talk so much about motherhood and the identity of motherhood on this page because it is such a fascinating subject because you go from being an individual into this archetype this idea in people's minds so whether or not you like it the role of mother once you take that on is going to politicize your identity so you don't have to talk about it but you should be aware of it
