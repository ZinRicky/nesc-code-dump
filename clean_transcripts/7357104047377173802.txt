Child Protective Services investigators just left my house after an interview because when you are co parenting with a narcissist you will become good friends with the people at Child Protective Services claims get made all the time and they have to make investigation so let me show you what my house looks like and what I look like so that if you're ever in the position you're not scared so here we go so first of all I do have this huge box of stuff in the corner because I'm gonna be moving soon so that really does not look that great but this is what my house looks like like if you were to just walk in I've got some big stuff in the way I have some other clutter right here and some other clutter right here but otherwise this is my house going into the kitchen this was my kitchen there is again there is gonna be stuff on my counters at home you're allowed to live in it there were dishes in my sink some are soaking so after you know they walked into my house we came into my kitchen and sat here at my table and this is where they did their like investigation they asked I'm in Colorado so they ask just different questions they ask about the incident that prompted the call they ask what you know about the incident they ask you about your children they'll ask you a little bit about each of your children like what what would you say about them how do you discipline your children what are the rules like in your home and then sometimes they do literally open your cabinets to check and see if you have food so they will literally asked to see the cabinets they didn't really ask me cause a lot of my food is on the counters and during our conversation I opened up my doors to show them where my food is and then a lot of times they will wanna see your kids rooms as well and so my kids rooms are not perfect by any means they're normal kids rooms stuff on the floor their beds aren't really neat um I had a bunch of kids you know I had a bunch of kids stuffed in one room that's fine um so yeah if you ever find yourself um if you ever find yourself that you are being investigated by Child Protective Services it's not the scariest thing in the world it's not the end of the world they're all usually pretty fucking nice people and as long as you're not outrageously wild with the shit you're doing or saying usually it should go well this is about the fifth time I've had them in my house I was actually shooting the shit with them about the previous workers that I've met so I hope that helps
