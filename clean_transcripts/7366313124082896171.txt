do I think every mom wants the exact same thing for Mother's Day no but what I do know is moms with kids under the age of ten don't wanna have to get their kids ready and leave the house in fact if that mom has multiple kids under the age of 10 she probably just wants to rest and sleep probably away from those kids you wanna know why the grannies and older moms are upset about all of my Mother's Day posts I've ever posted it's because they're not around their kids that much anymore they want their kids and grandkids around the moms with the young kids are around their kids too much they want Mother's Day to feel like the Queen that they are appreciated for all the work they do not extra work on that day no messes to clean up no butts to change no scheduled activities to make it to on time no arranging plans and gifts for their mother in law or their mothers they want a goddamn break they want a break that's what we're talking about when we say moms in the trenches want their own Mother's Day it's because they're fucking overworked and yeah we could go into lots of conversations about why they're overworked and whose fault it is and how we're gonna fix it but you know when not the day to do that Mother's Day they just want a goddamn break
