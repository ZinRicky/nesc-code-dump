this is not my normal content but with the end of Vanderpump Rules original cast coming to an end I wanna talk about Lala Kent for a second because I think she had one of the most interesting and relatable story arcs on this entire show and I think although it didn't start out this way and obviously it wasn't her intention it really serves as a cautionary tale to younger women about pick me behaviour and I don't say that to judge because I see a lot of similar behaviours in myself in my early 20s because Lala Kent was not the only woman who was taught the how to keep a man mentality you know if you look good and you're agreeable your husband won't leave you right as long as you're sexually adventurous and open and not like that nagging ex of his who never appreciated things he did he will treat you well and at one point or another we all believe that that is true Lala moved heaven and earth to be fun and cute and young and agreeable and sexually adventurous and super spontaneous and to help him take care of his step kids and his home and guess what a scumbag was always gonna be a scumbag and that's because and that's because a good and loyal man is not a reward for good behaviour it has to do with integrity and how they value their partner you know I know the old saying is that you can't turn a hoe into a housewife but you can definitely turn a hoe into a housewife more often than you can turn a scumbag into a saint so the cautionary tale in Lala's story is not that you can't turn a hoe into a housewife because she did and she was successful at it is that if a man treats women and his female partners like a commodity and has proven that in his ex relationship or blames the ending or cheating on his last relationship on something that the woman did performance wise it's that you will never be good enough to change a man from his true nature cause there's nothing in your power that you can do to keep a man who's always looking over the fence to see what's next and I just wish Lala the best in this new chapter of life
