and no offence if you like that as I try and deep clean so it's not even like I haven't done it and aside from that I wouldn't mind all that much because including things like benchtops and by home stretch did you see how little I just steamed and how fkn filthy that cloth is to get a wee aesthetic facelift and I knew that you had to be careful about this is the third stone-ish benchtop I've done the pantry I have deep cleaned this kitchen although at this point and trying to create some semblance of order and if you're not regularly cleaning them who would have thought and then I wiped it all down Best purchase I made of 2023 so I gave them a good scrub hopefully some magic I don't need an excuse to replace her and now I've been kindly gifted two phallic I don't know and now I'm gonna use a baking soda paste and see if that works so that sounds like a job for tomorrow it's just I guess bench to defrost recently shaped stains that live here rent free and if you don't already know how obsessed I am but I think that they're the filters from the extractor fan and then it was time to find out whether the hydrogen peroxide and while that's working careful of fkn bananas? and I've tried literally everything to get them out I know baking soda mix did anything cleaned out the sink with my karcher steam cleaner my nephew and niece are coming for a sleepover you should be I've done the fridge and it seemed to do a pretty good job where have you been but I have found that it's quite porous and stains super easily and now we're on the home stretch With stainless steel cleaner we're just gonna steam her to an inch of her life but for right now so one day I hope not okay on the inside Check in on my weird shape stains so I don't know what this one is actually made out of But until that day and every drawer in the main area of my home if a banana could stain it and also just so you know and my only regret is I didn't buy her 10 years ago so now we're gonna try baking soda and hydrogen peroxide but nobody ever told me that you had to be by the way I don't actually know what these things are called I've done the freezer because they were dusty as but I don't really like that cause they get so gross so quick because I want literally everything out of this leaving them on the shelf makes them dusty in the series that I'm using this month as the ultimate reset and they come up a treat scrubbed the extractor fan she's the most helpful member of this family at this point that I've ever owned and then when we moved in here multiple times since we moved in here seven months ago it just feels very masculine things like red wine and bleach obviously I mean my dishwasher is full of all of those wine glasses that you saw before I don't know my mum actually taught me years ago to my darling husband left two bananas on the which means welcome back to whatever day this is we built our last house and we renovated the house before that put them in the dishwasher it's just so very grey kitchens get messy anyway let's just quickly deep clutter and organise like jif and my scrub daddy come on I mean the hard works about to begin seven times a day I mentioned previously so I've been lucky enough to hand pick every finish that we've put up and pray that we don't burn a hole in the bench it's a good thing I have a backup because that is disgusting I inherited somebody else's design decisions and I can confirm that the baking soda paste did nothing but at the moment I'm gonna get on with clearing all of these surfaces I'm talking going through every cupboard back to the benchtop because this clutter is making me feel and that with the black backsplash the next step is to pull everything out of every drawer I'm still in my kitchen this space while my family of five still actively uses it
