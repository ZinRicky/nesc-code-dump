As a 41 year old woman who may or may not be entering the church. Stupid menopause. I got myself this fucking personal fan for summer. Cause it's supposed to be a fucking hot summer. Because this is my favorite part. This has a reservoir where you could put water and ice so that the fan can missed you. So that I will not be hot at all all summer. If you know a woman entering the change, please buy this for her.
