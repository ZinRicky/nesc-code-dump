look at my new T-shirt did you know that I love Zuko did you know that I recently only now Learned there's like actual genuine beef between like Zuko and Katara and then Aang Katara like shippers it's Kaang and Zutara and like I legitimately did not realize how much beef there was in the fandom because I've been a fan of after Last Airbender since I was you know a child like a literal child and I've always been a Zutara girl always um and I posted like a little TikTok cause I did a rewatch like last month and I posted a like a little TikTok edit of the two of them and ah they were calling me like a colonizer sympathizer in my comments they were like what do you mean you're supporting a relationship between a colonizer and the colonized I was like whoa whoa whoa everyone calm down everyone calm down whoa I am just talking about the ship that I've been a fan of and the thing is I know it's not cannon I don't even care if it's cannon or not like I like making up little things in my brain like whether or not it's cannon it's cannon here and like Zutara it doesn't have to be canon it's canon in here but I did not realize how much flak people were gonna have like I get it Katar and Aang or Canon fine whatever I can still like Zutara and I'm a little bit of a hater deal with it sorry but like oh my god I love this man I'm sorry like I've always been an enemy's lovers kind of girl I've always loved a redemption archive always loved an emo little shit even even those 9 years old right like I don't understand how y'all will give like more Grace to Iroh the literal war criminal then you will to the 16** year old that was abused by his family like I again I'm not justifying any of the action I just let me like Zutara please that's the only thing I I just didn't realize we had so much beef that's all
