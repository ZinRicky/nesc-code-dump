I asked them to like please please please could you please like search as there's a loss and found if there's any fucking way like please please please please please and then they were like yeah no there's nothing and there's nothing so now I know it's stolen and there was a sticker on it so that I could know it was hers so like it was intentional she's one of the disabled kids there's only a handful of them and thankfully they are like super integrated into the classrooms and stuff like she doesn't have a separate lunch she eats lunch with all the kids um you know I would rather her have this than have her stuck in her own self contained classroom and like never get to interact with her peers I just do think it's shitty that she “lost” her cup that was like perfect for her needs it wasn't just that it was a Stanley Cup that was like just a bonus point um thank you to everyone who offered to buy my daughter a cup I don't think there's a point like I I'm not gonna buy her another cup she's just gonna use like cups at school or have we're gonna have a different solution cause I feel like it's gonna happen again um the school is great and they do everything they can but I mean she's an easy target so I'm just gonna I'm just not gonna get her another cup and I appreciate all the offers it's extremely generous and it says so much about people's heart and it you know restores my faith in the world a little bit um so yeah that's that's where we end with stealing cops
