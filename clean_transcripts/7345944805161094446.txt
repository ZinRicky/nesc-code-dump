With everything going on with the Charleston Wine and Food Festival this weekend, it was amazing to have the Moxie Hotel host me for a stay overnight. I love a Charleston staycation, and the Moxie Hotel was so chic and fun. It was the perfect place to rest and relax between events. The Moxie has an eclectic, cool, upscale vibe, which is perfect if you're heading to Charleston for a fun weekend, a getaway, or even a staycation. It's in a great location to some of my absolute favorite restaurants like Pink Bellies and Melphy's. They were also hosting the media happy hour, so I jetted up to their sixth floor bar and lounge to meet some of the other influencers and media personnel that are covering the Charleston Wine and Food Festival. The view from the rooftop is the best I've seen in Charleston. You can see the entire Ravenel Bridge. And their cocktails at the bar were incredible. Definitely a little hidden gem if you're coming to Charleston or if you just need a night away.
