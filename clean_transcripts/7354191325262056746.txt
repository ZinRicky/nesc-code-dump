The most important things that you can do to be healthy is No.1 change your way of thinking and No.2 change the way you talk to yourself Self deprecation isn't helping you. Thinking other people can achieve things and you can't, isn't helping you. Thinking other people can reach their goals and you can't isn't helping you. You need to rewire your brain. If you struggle to think positive or if you practice this behavior and it's getting you nowhere. Tell yourself this instead, The better I eat, the better I look The better I look, the better I feel and the better I feel, the better I eat. Get used to this cycle. Rewire the way you think and the way you talk to yourself. Doing this will completely change your life and help you achieve your goals and stay healthy.
