hot take the sexist Golden Globes monologue this year wasn't embarrassing for women it was deeply embarrassing for men Joe so I quite playing up the prestige of a movie made by a man about a man and diminishing a movie about a woman made by a woman and just calling it a flick about boobies literally using the word boobies didn't just prove the point of the Barbie movie but it proved the point that the Barbie movie was trying to make the monologue and the Golden Globes were butt of reflection a mirror into our patriarchal society we watched a mediocre man under deliver on his job by humiliating women who were overqualified and over delivered on their job tell us all this time it's not just that women have to work twice as hard to get half of the credit it's that even when we reach a Pinnacle of success that's set by men by like doing acrobatics and somersaulting our way through all of this scaffolding that was designed by male institutions to keep us out we're still just a girl even when we win or especially when we win we're just a girl but here's the thing you can't put someone down for something that they are not only not ashamed of but that they're proud of and that's what the summer of Barbie the summer of Taylor Swift the summer of Beyonce has done women have been unbrainwashing themselves deprogramming themselves from that patriarchal idea right that there's something wrong with being a girl that there's something embarrassing about being a girl and that's why the jokes fall flat women finally know the secret that being a girl is awesome but being a boy on the other hand maybe you need to rebrand or maybe like an emergency dream board session of sorts um because it it seems like there there needs to be some new ideas thrown into the next just based on uh Joe wait I can't remember his name based on his set his sweaty set it seems like there needs to be we need to mix things up and I know that he doesn't speak for all men I saw your videos women posting uh their husbands cringing on the couch watching this guy drag their entire gender down women have been reimagining what it means to be a woman and the Golden Globes and this horrifying train wreck of a monologue show us that it's time for men to do that too only there was a movie that was like about the patriarchy and showed a relatable male character who uh you know goes on a journey to feel enough so that he doesn't have to degrade the women around him and himself uh in order to keep up with the patriarchy oh man if only there was a movie so to the men who still think that the Barbie movie was about women it wasn't about movies it was about you men who get it get it oops
