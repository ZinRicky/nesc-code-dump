so I got this comment on Instagram the other day from a fellow homeschool mom essentially she was telling me how she homeschools and how her way is right and my way is wrong and proceeded to say how every homeschool parent she meets is failing their children now hear me loud and clear you will never see that kind of criticism from me because as a teacher I know there's more than one way to teach your kids now the lack of teaching is one thing but I will never criticize someone for what or how they choose to teach their own children but if you want some encouragement and lesson ideas I'm your girl
