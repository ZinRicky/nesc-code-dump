I'm a homemaker with a chronic illness, and I get asked a lot of times how I managed to keep up with everything around my house while I'm struggling with chronic illness. This is one of my favorite tips. When I cook, I cook a lot of food. I basically cook in bulk, and then we eat on it for a few days, because I will often have one good day and then a few bad days, so this saves me a lot of energy. And then also, um, once the food is cool, I can freeze it and pull that out of the freezer later. So I just try to keep stuff like this on hand. Um, but bolt cooking is definitely one of my favorite tips. Tonight I made a pot of cheeseburger soup, and I should have enough leftovers to get us through at least the next day, maybe the day after that.
