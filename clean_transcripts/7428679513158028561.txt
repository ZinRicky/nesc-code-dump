I'm in my follicular phase which means I've got about one good day to clean up all of the mess that I made and all of the other phase and if I'm quite honest the entire house is currently embodying big luteal energy or as I like to call it ✨ depression ✨ and this bathroom is fkd and I'm embarrassed to admit it but I really don't have much of an excuse actually I do, my one excuse is that I share this bathroom with 4 other humans and three of them can't aim Ok and also the fact that the storage is shocking and there's pretty much no place to put things in here and also maybe we need to consider the fact that lately my mental health has been more mental and less health yay for me Ok so maybe I have three excuses that are weak at best and it still doesn't explain the chaos of the makeup drawer I don't know what happens whenever I'm in here I'm always short on time and just flapping around like a bat fresh out of hell just chucking products in on and around me and hoping for the best it's actually a bloody miracle that I ever look presentable but anyway I digress because obviously we're sorting the absolute shit out of this entire bathroom today starting with this drawer and my makeup obviously which is the No. 1 ick that I have for myself at the moment and I'm honestly beside myself with excitement about those lip gloss holder thingies I think they were like 10 bucks from Kmart and I wish I had them sooner put all my lip brow and eye stuff in there and it doesn't fall over whenever I open the drawer and you have no idea how happy that makes me then I wanted to keep the other side of the drawer more minimal because that's more like family shared space anyway moving on I sorted all the products behind the mirror and organised them into brands which funnily enough was actually how I had them originally organised and I could just about guarantee you that we will be making this exact same video in about six months time because I'm 33 right and I have never been able to maintain a bathroom organisation system and I can also just about guarantee you that it's not just me it's just life okay and a beautiful life is messy sometimes which is why sometimes we need to steam clean the shit out of everything we can And my toxic trait actually I have a couple one of them anyway is that now that I'm here tidying it I'm having to actively suppress the urge to just go get the paint out of the shed and get this bathroom a mini makeover and my husband must know me very well because he saw that glint in my eye and he asked me very nicely to please not do that right now is it a glint or is it mania? And deep down I know he's probably right because currently behind the scenes we're working on what might be our biggest renovation to date and we're in over our head, trying not to sink or go off the deep end those might be clues I don't know But I can't get the idea out of my head about painting the walls around the travertine a beautiful chocolatey brown because I think maybe it would make me hate this bathroom a little less but also I think I know my husband well enough to understand that the glint in his eye meant don't push this one Brit so for today I think I just need to settle for a few cute new decor items for my dopamine hit including these fake candles from Kmart which I always thought were tacky but now that I have them I'm actually obsessed and I think that they're tremendously fkn practical cause a pillar candle is one of my favourite types of candles but if you've ever used them you will know they make such a mess almost as much mess as what I found near this toilet sorry that was a really weak segue but anyway we're cleaning the toilet now obviously and because clearly I've been on a shopping spree at Kmart recently I also picked up this shower shelf cause I thought that maybe I deserved my own space in the shower zero out of 10 recommend it has already fallen down like 3 times I was a bit sceptical like how are you gonna adhese to a tile in a wet area? but I naively trusted the box and anyway it was disappointing but having a bathroom that doesn't feel like the inside of my brain is not disappointing however for the first time in a hot minute I feel like everything has a place and it makes me so happy and this is why I say cleaning is free therapy and now all I have to do is the entire rest of the house so I come back to watch that shit show
