I think dating a woman who low key hates men is the biggest feat you can accomplish as a man. That's how you know you've hit the top. That's how you know that you're better and more superior than everyone else that you are. Because she doesn't even like men. She thinks they're awful, but she still likes you. There's something great about you. Like, you should be very proud of that. And you should know that you're not gonna get cheated on because she doesn't like anyone. She doesn't.
