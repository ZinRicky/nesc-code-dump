I make fresh butter at least once a week, so let's make some roasted garlic and parsley butter today. I start by roasting my bulb of garlic in the oven and then pour some heavy cream into my Kitchen Aid. I whisk it on a low to medium speed at first while I chop up my parsley. I give it a good chop and make sure that it's small enough to incorporate into the butter. Once my heavy cream reaches this stage, I turn up the speed to a medium high speed and just let it go until the buttermilk separates. Once that happens, I turn my mixer off and my butter is pretty much done. Can use a strainer or your hands to just get all that buttermilk out. Just make sure you get as much of it out as possible. A lot of the times I ask lucky to come help me with this since I'm not that strong. Once all the buttermilk is pressed out, I transfer my butter over to a plate, sprinkle it with some parsley, my roasted garlic, some flaky sea salt, and make sure that it's all incorporated before I transfer it over to the fridge. And some wax paper to store.
