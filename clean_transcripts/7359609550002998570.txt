human nature takes over and doesn't matter how much you absolutely feel like you're in love and this is gonna work forever human nature is a thing and humans grow evolve and change and that's that is the only certain thing that we know I am right now a single mother to four kids I'm 41 years old and I was married for 10 years and um realized that that traditional gender life is miserable and lonely and sad and I was convinced that if I just found the right words to explain to my husband the man who watched me birth four of his children unmedicated saw me struggle through the adapting and changing of becoming a mother I was so positive that if I just found the right words the right combination the right moment to say this perfect combination of words he would finally get it he would wake up and he would see oh I don't I'm so I didn't realize that this is what I'm so sorry I'm so sorry all the previous conversations that we've had the 10 years you've been explaining these things to me and how they've only gotten worse I've never really improved any of these things you've been asking me to do babe I'm I'm never again from today on I'm your husband I'm your faithful husband like I promised you that day but that's not reality he does know he does know he's an adult if he is an adult functioning in this world he's got jobs he's got other relationships that he's able to maintain he can go to the grocery store and come home without you know dying or getting arrested he's a fully functioning adult that absolutely understands the pain he's causing but he also understands that you are beholden to those marriage vows not him he knows that you hold to those marriage vows tightly that you are bound by them but clearly he's not so if you're staying in a marriage because it's been any length of time number one that's the sunk cost fallacy you're just staying because there's been a long time but it's never gonna change and he is never gonna wake up because he already is awake and he is manipulating the situation for his benefit and he will continue to do so as long as you allow it
