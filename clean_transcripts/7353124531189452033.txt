Now that I saw you, don't wanna think of anything else. Now that I thought of you, maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down. Maybe I stormed out of every single room in this town, threw out our clothes and our daggers because it's morning now. It's brighter now. Now I don't wanna look in. They are, they say they are. They say they like.
