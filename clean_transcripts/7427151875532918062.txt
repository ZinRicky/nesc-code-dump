my kids are 6 and 8 and it has been a hot minute since I have been woken up in the middle of the night for something but last night my little guy has stuffy nose and it was like 4:00am and he was crying cause he couldn't breathe but woke up his sister and she came to get me and today I am so tired I like can't function right reminds me of like all of the moms who are in the trenches of early motherhood and are waking up multiple multiple times a night this so so hard and I'm with you and I feel you and it does get better I promise
