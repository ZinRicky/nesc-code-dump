my kids are going to a food fight tonight our chiropractor decided he wanted to host a food fight at his house and invited all the kids and so that's what they're doing and quite honestly the thought of this really grosses me out and makes me wanna gag but I know my kids are gonna have so much fun I've been thinking about what I can contribute that has a good texture will be fun to thread and I thought about the pull leftover after juicing so I got to juicing and started with the oranges fun fact about me I always have a bag of oranges on hand to make fresh orange juice you will not find store bought juices in my house after I enjoyed that orange juice I went through my fridge and pantry and got all of the fruit that was about to go back and now my kids are food fight ready
