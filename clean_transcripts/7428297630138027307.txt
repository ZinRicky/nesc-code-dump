The quickest way to ruin your relationship or marriage is by not appreciating your partner I just saw a TikTok about this girl saying that her husband came home from work and she's a stay at home girlfriend they don't have any kids they just have a cat and he tells her “it looks like you've done nothing all day” and she's upset rightfully so this is the way to ruin your relationship by not appreciating each other I'm the first person to give men the benefit of doubt maybe he's had a hard day but that still should never be taken out on your partner That fairy that restocks the fridge restocks toiletry restocks and cleans everything behind you women are usually those fairies okay if you want your partner your little fairy to continue doing those things I suggest you appreciate it and never ever ever tell your partner it looks like you've done nothing all day
