I have to keep a stash of the drink that I like on hand, because what I like to do is get one and act like I'm gonna drink it. This is caffeine. It's got 150 milligrams of caffeine. And it's tea. It's not coffee. I don't like coffee. I have to keep a stash of them in my refrigerator, because I like to grab one, act like I'm gonna drink it, and then I set it down. Um, the coffee table, I never open it until it gets room temperature warm, and then I'm like, I don't want to drink that, so I have to go get another one. But they're really good.
