I saw another creator on here talk about how they do a low spend no spend September and focus on using everything out of their freezer and pantry and get creative with meals just using up things they already have and I thought you know what this is such a good idea because we are getting ready to move in like two weeks and the last step we have to move from this house to the other house the better so I thought okay I am not gonna grocery shop I am just going to like use up the things that we have in our freezer pantry and we're gonna do this thing no one I realized we primarily eat fresh fruits and veggies so like halfway through the week we got down to like bare bones nothing left to eat the second problem is the things in the freezer and pantry require me to do all of the cooking and listen cooking three meals a day plus all the snacks I'm gonna lose my ever loving mind I don't enjoy cooking that is not my thing and having to prepare everything for the entire month was not gonna fly so safe to say I didn't Insta card order and I got my sweet treats that I love and my fridge is stocked full again
