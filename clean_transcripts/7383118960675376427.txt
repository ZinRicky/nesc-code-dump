eating liver is not going to cause vitamin a toxicity and the studies done on vitamin a toxicity were done using an isolated synthetic version in supplement form if the supplement bottle does not label it as either beta carotene or fish oil it's probably synthetic the synthetic version being toxic being a fat soluble vitamin it needs to be accompanied by other micronutrients in order to be properly synthesized by the body and natural vitamin a really only comes from animal based sources so instead of trying to fill the gap in micronutrients with a cabinet full of synthetic isolated supplements why don't we just simply go to the source and eat food
