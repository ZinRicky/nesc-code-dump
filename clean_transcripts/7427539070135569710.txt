So I just got my Halloween nails done. I put these little stars on them because tonight I'm going to my friend Andrea's birthday. She's doing it at a magic show, and it is costume required. So look at the mood board that she sent us. This is the vibe for her whole party. It's, like, mystical, magical. She's a Halloween baby, and she is a peacock, just like me. So the girl is going to be dressed to the nine, so I have to show up. So I thought these were really appropriate because I'm gonna go as, like, a sorceress, kind of mystical witch lady. Um, I'll show you the costume later, but it's going to be so much fun. I haven't been to a magic show since I was 6, so I have no idea what to expect. I'm gonna take you along with me because this is a really cool event to do in Charleston. I've never heard of it, and I cannot wait to go.
