this is a really good question okay so if the citizens of Kansas enshrined abortion rights into their state constitution then how come the attorney general of Kansas is currently one of the plaintiffs suing the FDA to try to restrict mifepristone, a common and safe abortion medication, for all American women including women in Kansas I say restrict there but more accurately they're effectively trying to ban it because some of the restrictions for example that you would need three in person appointments before your seventh week of pregnancy like nobody would be able to do that nobody is going to be able to access this drug anyways in response to your question the attorney general of Kansas would say well you can still get abortions in Kansas I'm not necessarily trying to restrict your access to abortion I just have a duty to protect you from this harmful drug that the FDA wrongfully approved even though mifepristone is a very safe drug it is safer than Tylenol it's safer than Viagra and it is far safer than forest childbirth it's kind of like when we had the Protection of Roe v Wade and Republicans would always try to come up with unnecessary hurdles to try to block women from accessing abortions under the guise of saying that they're just protecting women and girls with common safe restrictions
