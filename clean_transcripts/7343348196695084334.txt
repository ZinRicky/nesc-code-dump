Being a stay at home mom is a job. Being a stay at home wife is a job. Taking care of the house while your husband provides for you is a job. So when a woman stays at home while her husband provides for her and isn't working, she is working and her husband is covering the cost of that work. When you pay a nanny to take care of your kids, when you drop your kids off at daycare and pay the daycare, when you pay a housekeeper, a house manager, to take care of the house, that's considered work. All of the work that those people are doing is considered work. But when a woman who stays at home does it, it's not work. No, very much is work, and it's hard work.
