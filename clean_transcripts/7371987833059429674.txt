It looks like you're wearing a beautiful gown, but you can be comfortable because it's pants and it covers you like you're. You don't feel exposed. You don't feel like you're showing too much, but you also don't feel like, frumpy, dumpy. No, truly. Because of the wide leg and the flowy fabric of this Halara jumpsuit, it feels so elegant and glamorous, but also like pajamas. You also have deep pockets. It has this waistband that helps create that waistline. It's got the V neck to keep you looking slim up top. I've worn this to, like, my kids little choir concert and then I wear it to brunch. I'll go on a date. This would be perfect for a summer wedding. Shut up. I am 5 9 and 165 pounds and I got a size medium because I like the way it holds me in.
