welcome to Holly Academy Today we're learning math reading and Bible if you've been watching these videos you've probably noticed we do school pretty much everywhere except a table why because kids are not meant to sit at a table or desk all day long they need to move they need to get their energy out so we do a lot of that during our you may have also noticed we don't do a whole lot of workbooks or worksheets around here either my kids all kids learn so much better through multi sensory activities so I try to incorporate as many hands on activities as I possibly can and it can be simple as writing your math problems on your sliding glass door instead of doing a worksheet one of my favorite ways to make reading hands on is with these Bananagram letter tiles you probably notice we've used them almost every single day and I have done this since my kids were increasing they go great with all about reading our reading curriculum so if you are in the market for a new reading curriculum I highly suggest you check it out my kids are only two years apart and my son is pretty advanced so we do a lot of family style learning in our house which is just a fancy way of saying they learn together they're doing the same thing at the same time reading is the only subject where they have separate instruction even then we do some of it together like our irregular words just because it's easier on me my expectations and the independent activities are different based on their age but overall they do most of the same thing today we ended our day with Bible which is my absolute favourite subject cause I just love getting in the word with my kids and that is a wrap for our school day come back and learn again with us tomorrow
