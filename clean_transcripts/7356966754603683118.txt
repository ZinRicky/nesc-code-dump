one of the benefits of dressing the way I do is that it turns to me as an introvert and I know what you're gonna say you make videos on the internet how can you be an introvert well you have to remember that when I'm doing these videos I'm talking to my phone alone by myself okay it's very different than large social situations so the way I dress actually is works as a really great icebreaker or conversation starter when I'm out in social situations or out in public it's much easier to start a conversation when somebody compliments your outfit or your accessories or your shoes because I love to have conversations with strangers I love to create new friendships but what I will not be doing is starting those conversations because I'm very much on the inside that the shy girl on the side of the room who is not going to start a conversation but is really hoping someone will come up and say hi so the look not only cute but it helps make me friends or at least starts conversations with acquaintances it also has the added benefit of attracting comments and compliments and conversations with women teenage girls and gay men which arguably top notch top tier compliments shoes I'm thinking shoes and bag so if you see me out and you're part of those demographics please say hi cause it's you know it's kind of the point
