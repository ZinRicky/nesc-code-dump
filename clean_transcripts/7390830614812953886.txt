today is day four and the final day of our shark unit study these are the activities we did we practice spelling those same words from day one and two but this time they had to spell them independently I read the words out loud and they use their letter towels to spell them this is a great example of how you can do the same activity but practice different skills next we did a sight word fishing game not exactly a shark activity but we pretended we were fishing for bait I also don't teach words and we can talk about that on a different day so I just pulled out words that my kids already know then for math we practice measurement I got this activity of teachers PE teachers and none of these sharks measured to the inch so we also practice rounding up to the nearest whole number and then we played our favourite math game I c 10 we take turns thing of our cards until you see two or three numbers that add together to make a 10 as you can probably tell during our lessons Maverick is all over the place but he is five almost six and this is totally normal for a little boy I don't want you to think it's always butterflies and rainbows over here so here's an example what really happens in our day to day life she was winning in the pool shark and lost all of her cards and threw a fitback she eventually just quit playing and I just paid no attention to it they finished their day with her final report on saw sharks I glued all these into their science notebooks because I am not going to save a bunch of loose leaf paper and that is a wrap on our Shark Week unit study if you enjoyed these let me know maybe next week I'll start sharing what a typical week looks like for us
