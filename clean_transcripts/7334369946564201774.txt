making new mom friends is really hard a because I show up at the playground looking like this but B because between me being sick one of my kids being sick or they're being some sort of scheduled event that leaves I would say about 45 seconds in the month of February that I've been able to even consider texting somebody to get together all I want is somebody to come over to my backyard so I can set up a bouncy castle we can make some margaritas and get to trash talking not about anything serious maybe about like Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey or about how much money Blippi's worth and the fact that he was also a like an adult YouTube star before being blippi and he actually took a poop on a friend on a video and it's been scrubbed from the internet you didn't hear from me
