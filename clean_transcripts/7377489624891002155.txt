My husband doesn't eat cake, but it is his birthday in the morning and he requested his mom's chocolate cake. So when everyone went to bed, I started baking. I combined some water and butter in a pot and let that boil on the stove before whisking in some cocoa powder. I poured that into my dry ingredients, cracked an egg in it, added some sour cream, and beat that on a low speed. When it all came together, I poured it into my sheet pan and popped it in the oven for about 20 minutes. While that's baking, I clean up my workstation before moving on to making my frosting. Frosting is very simple. Add some cocoa powder, sour cream, and some milk before I sift in some powdered sugar, mix that until smooth and spread it all over my cake. My husband doesn't really like celebrating his birthday, but I decided to make it just a tad more special by putting up some decorations. I decided on a golden black theme for his birthday birthday, so I got some balloons that would match that and put them up on top of our stove and also on the ceiling. I got this birthday banner and thought it would be a lot bigger, but nevertheless I put it up and sprinkled some of these Golden Star confetti on in the kitchen counter before packing his little gift bag. Lucky! And I don't do surprises that well, so I already got Him his birthday presents a while ago. So this wasn't the big present. Then I unpacked all of my candles and prepped them for the morning before I wrapped up my cake and finally went to bed.
