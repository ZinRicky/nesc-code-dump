Let's put together some Nature Explorer backpacks for my kids. So I'm hiding in my dining room right now because I'm trying to put something together for the kids. That's a surprise that they're just upstairs, but I'm putting together little Nature Explorer backpacks for them. First off, I got these cute little kids size backpacks on Amazon. Each kid is gonna get a pair of, like, outdoor gloves, a set of binoculars, a magnifying glass, and a couple of these little specimen jars. That is a fake spider that I came with. So everything's just gonna go in the little bag. And this is a perfect gift. If you have a kid who's super into nature and hiking and exploring the outdoors, you can find pre made ones. But I really wanted to be able to pick the different things that I put in. Knowing my kids and what they're into, I thought about also adding in, like, a little, like, bird watching guide or an insect guide or a plant identifying guide to kind of lead their play in their exploration a little bit, too. Just an idea. So now my kids are ready for their next outdoor adventure.
