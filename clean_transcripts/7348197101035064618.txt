on a cliffhanger about my ex who owes me about $60,000 financial abuse is so very real and so insidious because women are always the ones who are accused of being gold diggers but that is the story that men have made up and ever since women entered the workforce they are trying to pay us as little as they can and take as much of our money as they can just about every single abusive relationship I've been in unfortunately there've been a couple we all know how that goes until until you heal yourself you're gonna continue finding different versions of yourself pointing out the areas that you need to heal enough about that uh in every single one of them there has been financial abuse you know it somehow it's my fault that they're in this situation and because they're spending so much of their time and energy on me I owe them my money because they can't work or they can't earn as much if they wouldn't have been giving so much to me or some version of some bullshit story they need to borrow some money they need to stay with you like they are just using and abusing women and leaving us in the dust and it is not a measure of intelligence it is a measure of their manipulation and willingness to be cruel
