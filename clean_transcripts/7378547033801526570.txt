Interests and hobbies are very important Equally as important as your partner in your relationship having hobbies so you can come together share your interest or even share the same hobbies it's great for any relationship but what's most important in any relationship is having the same taste in interior design probably the most important because I don't know what I would do if my husband came to me and said oh I really like neon colors in the house or I like the 70s quirky retro aesthetic because no.. I'm beige modern Our relationship would not work if that was his style don't get me wrong we're not always gonna have the same taste but interior design it's very important thankfully he likes the same color scheme I do he likes clean he likes the clean girl aesthetic I think that's one of the most valuable things in a relationship
