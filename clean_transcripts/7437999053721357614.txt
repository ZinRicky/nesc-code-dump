The last time I got ginger ale, it was flat, and it was all around just a disappointing experience. And since I was craving one, I knew that as soon as I got home, I had to just make myself one. I started by peeling all of my ginger and slicing it into pieces. I prefer doing this over grating it. I transferred it over to a bowl and got started on making a simple syrup by combining water and sugar. Let that warm up until the sugar dissolved before adding in all of my ginger and returning it to the heat. I let it come to a boil and then reduce that to a simmer and let that go for about 15 minutes and then let it sit for another 30. Once it was done steeping, I strained it through a fine mesh strainer and transferred it over to a smaller container so that I could cool down in the fridge for about 45 minutes. And that's all I had to do. I filled my glass with some ice, the syrup, topped it with some soda water, and I always need to have my ginger ales with a fresh squeeze of lime, so that's exactly what I did, and this was exactly why I was craving. And it was heavenly.
