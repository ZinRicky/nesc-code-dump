When I asked my toddlers what they wanted for breakfast this morning, they both said donut holes. Since I don't make them a lot, I decided to surprise them and do it today. Started by adding some flour, baking powder, salt, some sugar into my bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together an egg and some milk, and then combine my dry and wet ingredients before giving that a good mix and adding some melted butter in as well. Once that was all combined, I set it aside while I heated up my oil. I always opt for a coconut oil if I can. I transfer that over to the stove and let it come to temperature before forming my dough into little balls and frying them. Once they were golden brown, I transfer them over to my plate, and I did this in patches so I wouldn't over crowd my pot. Once all my dough was fried, I moved on to making a simple lemon glaze by combining some lemon juice and powdered sugar. Once that was all smooth and combined, I coated all of my doughnut holes in my icing before transferring them over to a plate. At this point, my kids were so excited to have breakfast.
