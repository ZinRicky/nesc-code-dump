I am sitting here at lesson planning for it tomorrow trying to figure out what I want to do with my kids and I remember that I have this game from the TikTok shop it is a soundbox mats phonemic awareness game and it says it helps students build a phonemic awareness skills by segmenting words into individual sounds or phoning and right now I am working on breaking apart two syllable words with my daughter and my son is working on blends and this has it all here so I pulled out the two syllable words for my daughter to practice tomorrow and the final blends for my son to practice tomorrow let me show you how it works this that comes with dry erase marker and chips so what they will do is they're going to segment and sound out the word so we've got the word moo ah it rocket and in this word the C k it sticks together to make the sound and so then they will use their chips to sound out as they go rock it rocket it's super easy to wipe right off and you move on to the next one so the game comes with 80 cards and it practices so many Fini mix skills initial blends and blends valteins CVC words multi syllable words it is so good you can start it as soon as your child is ready to blend their sounds together
