I've made this warm Chimichurri chicken and orzo salad probably twice a week for the last month or so and in my opinion it's getting pretty close to perfection and it's not just quick easy and delicious but it's adaptable to whatever season you're in or whatever protein you'd like and somehow the leftovers taste even better the next day start by finding dicing garlic half a shallot alongside coriander and parsley pop all that in a large mixing bowl and then add dried oregano red wine vinegar olive oil lemon juice and salt and pepper give it a stir then I like to reserve about half a cup at this point and like anything the longer you marinate it for the better it tastes so you can make the chimichurri sauce or marinate the chicken ahead of time but today I'm in a rush so I've added seared chicken transferred that to a cast iron dish and pop that in the oven at about 200Â°C for about half an hour for my salad I've got orzo, chickpeas rocket tomato cucumber capsicum avocado and bocconcini pour over the reserved dressing and then give it a good mix and then to plate I put a generous portion of that salad down top it with my sliced chimichurri chicken and I finish it all off with some extra sauce from the pan and I'm telling you right now this meal will not disappoint each bite is a flavour experience it's herby, it's tangy it's hearty and dare I say it fkn good for you
