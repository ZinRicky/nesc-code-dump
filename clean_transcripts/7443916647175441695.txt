let me tell you about this this is a neck back heating pad it is amazing one of my favorite things I use it every night ties around full back coverage neck there is heat all the way through so it gets your shoulders your back your neck muscles the cord is really long so it's great reach and then you can change the temperature you can set how long you want it I always do 120 degrees for 60 minutes and it doesn't stay hot for the full 60 minutes it will get you to the perfect temperature and then cool down a little bit and then heat up again it is so nice I love this thing
