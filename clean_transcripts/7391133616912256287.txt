say hello to my double chin gosh why did nobody tell me about that I swear the people in my life hate me because nobody ever told me that I had a double chin I did not know until I started vlogging and now I cannot not see anywho it's Saturday and let's make some scrambled pancakes for my kids normally my husband is on weekend duty but apparently that man needed to sleep so here I am making some breakfast I've been seeing the scrambled pancake trend going around and thought I'm gonna give it a try because quite honestly I cannot make normal pancakes I don't know what it is but they come out messed up every single time fun fact my grandma and extended family are Amish and I grew up around people making their food from scratch my entire life but for some reason I did not get that trend and that is pretty obvious watching this video in this house we have a pretty strict no food in the bedroom rule but we're gonna break that today because mama wants to go back to bed and read it so these little babes are gonna have a special treat uh breakfast in bed and some iPad time happy Saturday everyone
