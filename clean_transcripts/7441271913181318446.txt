I did biology last year with my first grader in kindergarten here's how I did it so instead of using the sydap book that comes with it I went on their website and downloaded the LA book it's a PDF and I printed one of these out for each of my kids it was a little bit easier for my younger kids to use it than doing the sydap book a side outlaw book is referenced a lot in the story I went ahead and made my kids a side outlaw book using the lapbook materials so this is just whatever topic we were learning and then I took all of the same information and just glued it right in here so as we went we did the same things just made it a little bit more simplified for them so every new lesson we did the same thing put it in and then if we have something extra that we did like they wrote camels I have them write a little writing prompt and just added it right to our journal so it kinda became a collection of everything we studied throughout the year and any additional information that we could add to it and you loved it didn't you yes was her favourite lesson we've done so far
