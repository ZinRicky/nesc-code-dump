women are just so sick of softening our language for the benefit of men I don't think I've ever actually said that I hate men on this app um I've obviously spoken a lot about how men behave and how men treat us and the benefits of decentring men from your life and men choose to interpret that as misandry hatred of men and I always say and I love it when people say this is people tell you who they are usually when someone accuses you of something that is just not really making that much sense or accuses someone of something that doesn't make that much sense it's cause it's more about them they're telling you who they are they're seeing in others what's in themselves so many men actually do have misogyny inside of them and actually don't respect women and sometimes hate women so when they hear women like me talk about men they assume I hate men and sometimes I wish that I did cause I think it would just be easier but I think like they don't understand the amount of patience and empathy we have for men like that we can see beyond their hateful language and see that underneath that they're actually struggling with the patriarchy in their own way just the way we are and that doesn't justify the way that they treat us you know an explanation not a justification etcetera but we know that when we speak about the behaviour of man that the man who other good ones won't be offended they won't be defensive they won't think it's about them they won't feel the need to lash out and that's the point we don't have to Panda to the ones who are the least worth pandering to through our language I don't know that there's many women who actually hate all men I'm sure that every woman has men in their life who they love and respect and a lot of the time we're really just talking about hating patriarchy and hating how certain men treat us and I think a lot of this nuance can be lost on this on these apps if women had done to men what men have done to women men would hate us a lot more than we hate them and I think it's funny that they are struggling to hold the contradictions that you might be strong and independent you might be a feminist and you might still love men wanna have babies I mean I personally spent the afternoon mending things and sewing and cleaning and cooking and like you know like these things can all exist at once but their goal is to put you in these binary categories good woman or bad woman they the very essence of the problem is refusing to see women in their whole personhood and understand that we contain multitudes women contain multitudes and we just ask that we're seen and respected as entire people and not put in these boxes it's really important I think not to be able to be pinned down by men as a woman or defined by men as a woman and that's because that's the very thing that they wanna be able to do and that's the very thing that will strip you of your full identity and I think you know it I do get a certain level of pleasure from like seeing when they are confused about who I am because they'll think that they've got me pegged as this certain type of woman a man hating lesbian or desperately lonely and unhappy or absolutely no fun at all because it's much easier for them to just categorise a woman into ABC cause we're so capable of so many things like we're capable of being feminist and loving men and having babies and hating patriarchy and hating some men and hating cooking and loving cleaning and hating our jobs and loving our jobs and wanting to be housewives and then wanting to go out and get careers and we're just capable of like all of it and we're just asking that we have the freedom to exercise our agency in this world without being judged disrespected questioned made to feel unsafe just in the same way that men are automatically given their agency called entitlement in this world
