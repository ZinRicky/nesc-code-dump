one thing about me is I'm always ready to change my opinion on something I was over here heheing and hahaing about the 10 year olds at Sephora and I saw one video one video where this woman was like of course the 10 year olds are at Sephora the mall is one of their only third places mall is one of the only places where teenagers can still hang out changed immediately my opinion change that little bit of context I was like I don't know why I didn't think about that you're so right where else are the kids gonna go she was like of course teenagers are annoying you were annoying as a teenager do you know what's more annoying a millennial making fun of a teenager for being a teenager and I was like real correct yes wow and I think it's so important to be able to change your opinion when a new perspective is brought into life because often we're not thinking about the deeper implications of the things that we talk about online and obviously it would be great if we just thought about it to begin with but if you don't that's fine if when someone tells you oh hey what about this you're okay with being like oh I didn't think about that thank you for letting me know and that's why I make a lot of the videos that I do on like small things that are fatphobic because I'm assuming that you're not intending on being fatphobic but a lot of our society is inherently fatphobic so if you don't have someone with that knowledge to be like oh hey that's not cool you're not gonna know and that's fine you don't have to be aware but when someone makes you aware and is like oh hey that's not cool oh wait what about this perspective oh what about this you're like oh I didn't know that thank you for letting me know and switching up we live in a world where information is being thrown at us at a never before seen rate so of course we're gonna make judgments on things and have to change them and have to change our opinions over time like that is very normal and like okay
