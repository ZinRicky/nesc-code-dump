I'm a Tradwife stay at home mom homemaker whatever labels you wanna slap on there and while I absolutely love the aprons the baking the dresses the general aesthetics that are popular in this niche I just want you to know that you do not have to fit yourself into a box to be any of those things being a traditional wife being a homemaker is not a one size fits all thing and everyone's lives are very different from one another's and I think that's what makes this community so beautiful nobody is perfect and we are all doing our best you can pursue excellence yes absolutely 100% pursue excellence in any field that you're in but don't get hung up on perfection and just know you were doing great
