did you know as a society we cater to men's needs so much that there are men who get jealous of their Newborn infants I know I could kind of not believe it either but I recently saw a Reddit and am I the asshole Reddit of a guy who was asking in earnest if he was the asshole for wanting to divorce his eight week postpartum wife because she could no longer keep up with handling his needs both physically and emotionally while caring for their eight week old infant now if you've never had a child eight weeks is not very long to be postpartum at all and beyond you feeling like you've been hit by a truck potentially dealing with physical and emotional outcomes from your postpartum period you're learning how to care for a new human being who yeah needs you a whole lot more than a full grown adult now don't get me wrong postpartum is really hard on a couple but as the man considering what your partner just went through if you are not sympathetic to that and taking a little bit of a backseat right now for the benefit of your partner and your new baby in order for them to heal and bond together what the fuck are you even doing this is arguably the most vulnerable time in a woman's life and you're dropping the ball if you're worried about how often you're getting sex now and yes this poster was talking about the fact that he wasn't getting regular sex eight weeks postpartum I just can't imagine a situation where I gave birth to a baby only to realise I was living with another one
