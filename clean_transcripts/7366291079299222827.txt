You literally set up your camera and then went and sat down and blah, blah, blah, just so you can film it. Yeah. Did you see? The shit went viral. What's the problem? What's the question here? Where's the confusion here? I mean, yeah, when you watch Transformers, did you think there was really robots in the streets making explosions and shit? Or do you think they set up cameras and had people come and did all this shit and filmed it? Oh, my god. It's like the most ignorant shit ever.
