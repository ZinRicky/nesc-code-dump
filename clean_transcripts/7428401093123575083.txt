yeah so it's not terrible for everyone let me explain to catch everybody up to speed last week the attorneys general of Missouri Kansas and Idaho sued the FDA to try to restrict mifipristone a common and safe abortion medication for all American women because they say they have a duty to protect women and girls by forcing us to give birth also claim that widely available abortion medication is depressing the expected birth rates for teenage mothers they're saying this is a bad thing because it may reduce their state's population which could result in less federal funding for the states it's horribly disgusting back to this comment so forcing children and teenagers to give birth is not bad if you're the patriarchy these girls are 40% less likely to receive a high school diploma and only 10% of them will complete a two year college program they're much more likely to depend on public assistance programs and men daughters of teenage mothers are much more likely to become teenage mothers these girls suffer from social stigma low self esteem higher rates of DV and SA they have difficulty finding adequate housing and job opportunities and this creates a situation where it is much harder for girls and women to participate in public life much less political life The patriarchy flourishes in this type of environment it is not about saving babies protecting girls protecting women you cannot claim to be protecting girls when you are actively forcing 10 11 12 year old children to give birth it is self serving patriarchal control
