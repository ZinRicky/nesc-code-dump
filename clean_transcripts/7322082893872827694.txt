good morning um I wanna start off by saying that Casey is absolutely a brilliant woman I love her opinions on almost everything and I wanna talk about her take on feminism especially intersectional feminism and choice feminism which is something that I do talk about on my page first of all I'm gonna humble myself right now and say that I am much earlier in my feminist education than Casey is so when I hear people who know more than I do I shut up and I listen and sometimes that means having really uncomfortable conversations with myself because if I really am honest with myself and I think back to how I became a stay at home mom choice wasn't a huge part of it I had just started out of my career I was working in a male dominated field I had career aspirations and I became a stay at home mom like a lot of women do out of necessity I have since loved my life and adopted this appreciation for this way of life but under the current system we live under it was a necessity not a choice and that is the patriarchy and that's why there is still so much work to do so until we have equity we need to keep talking
