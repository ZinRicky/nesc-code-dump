if you invite a man out on a date maybe grab a drink grab some lunch, dinner he should not have to pay the entire tab now before you get angry put yourself in his shoes. if he asks you out on a date would you expect him to leave you with an entire tab no, no you wouldn't so why are you inviting him out expecting him to pay the entire Bill if you ask someone out you generally pay the Bill YOU are asking them out or you could split it but generally if you're asking someone out you're inviting them out to treat them This really shouldn't be a debate it's common decency And for the love of god and anything sacred stop expecting a relationship to work if it's only one sided
