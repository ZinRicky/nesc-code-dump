okay hair routine first clean off your brush I use a Denman brush I think that is the best for like me personally I do love how easy it is to like take the hair out of this though oh when I get out of the shower I just make sure my hair is brushed I brush it out a little bit but so I start from obviously the bottom of my hair and I move up when I'm brushing my hair um that is like a you know brushing hair 1:01 but also I didn't know until someone told me so my hair is also like a little bit dry right now drier than I prefer it to be but it is what it is first step leave in conditioner you don't have to use this one I like it smells so yummy um I am running out tap the bottom like this but yeah couple pumps I don't have any particular way that I put it in my hair I just Rake it through and then hope then I get all the hair so I found this on TikTok apparently it's Brazilian Curl cream leaving conditioner I use the entire thing this thing is huge it lasted me like several months um one thing about me is when I have empties like you you can trust me on my empties because I have such bad ADHD like very often I will lose things or forget about them before I finish so if I finish something you can trust me on it I really like this one don't have it right now have to rebuy 
 next my holy grail product the Shea Moisture Curl Cream Enhancing Smoothie I literally this is the product that I have been using since I don't know high school and this is the one product I keep coming back to you know like whatever else changes in my routine this does not I've tried I've tried other curl creams I've tried other products this is like the one thing that I'm like okay you should okay girl uh this is the one thing that I'm like okay they're nothing for my particular hair type works as good as Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie again I just Rake it through my hair she is going to work for me every time then I would typically go in with Moose this is the one I use but I did break the cap off and I don't think there's a way I don't think I'm getting this out today unfortunately it's really embarrassing oh I'm so awesome and amazing oh my god I'm so awesome and amazing ha ha ha I use my nail um I have a little bit of mousse okay slay I get mousse and again I I mean there might be different methods I Rake shit through my hair and specifically with mousse I like to scrunch it into my roots I at one point my life stopped using mousse cause I heard that it dried out your hair but honestly like it's kind of necessary it makes my curls look better I do I do recommend it cause my hair does last and I think the ringlets are a little bit bigger I'm like throughly impressed that I was able to do that um but you know get a mousse that works is it the Kerastase Mousse Bouffante (sorry if I mispronounced that!) oh L'oreal Paris Awesome I didn't know that my friend got it for me finally I go in with a gel this is the advanced climate control from Ouidad um the curl experts I really like this I've had this for a very long time and it's I only use a very little amount it's a little bit thinner than the typical gels that I use but again I think any gel works it's just like very thin and that you have small layer and I kinda just put it through my hair um because when it's drying I want you know a *little* bit of a gel cast to just kind of keep the structure of the hair this also doesn't leave my hair like crunchy um I think gel again you gotta find what works for you um for me I'm not the biggest fan of like the the hard cast so I use this um so now that I have all the product in my hair I use my denman brush and I take pieces of my hair and then I just kind of shake it I don't always do this sometimes I just crunch but I have noticed I have bigger ringlets and my curls last a little bit longer when I do this so this is the method I've been doing recently I just do this again I'm not an expert in hair this is just what I have been doing um oh actually everything that I've Learned about curly hair I've Learned from the internet primarily from black women um and now also other Arab women um because my mom is Bulgarian and has straight hair my dad is Egyptian and that is where my curly hair is from um but obviously like they didn't really know how to do curly hair when I was growing up so that's really difficult for me and it wasn't until I got it like I found like kind of the natural hair community on Instagram that I started learning how to do my hair um so all credit to them but this is how I do it um again I think I have like three a B I think growing up it was like B c now it's I think a B and I just crunch it after also I don't know if I'm doing this right this is just again I do and then I wait no joke 10 hours for it to dry so I'm not a big fan of diffusers anytime I use a diffuser my hair gets frizzy I think also like I have like a regular degular diffuser from TJ Maxx might not be the best um but my hair always in my opinion looks best when I air dry um which is a little bit unfortunate especially in the winter however this is what I do something that helps is I got a lot of layers in my hair um and I think the layers have helped with the volume and the curl uh so yeah that's my hair routine I am now midway through the day and my hair is like half dry mostly dry like the roots are still wet um but this is what the curls are looking like right now
