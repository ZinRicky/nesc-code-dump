mentally I'm finding it pretty hard to believe that five weeks have already passed since we started this but the bags under my eyes and my aching lower back are putting up a pretty convincing argument that it has in fact been 30 something long days since we drained the old girl today we're sanding everything and I'm pretty sure the sanders got more control over me than I do it meanwhile Mark's on the hunt for pool cancer so you go around listening and when you find a hollow spot it needs to be removed right and would you look at that he found one and I'm not too sure if it's cause it sounded slightly different or because it was glaringly fkn obvious that whatever was going on here Needs to change Either way I can confirm that putting holes in the bottom of a pool is nothing short of terrifying and aside from the fact that I was irrationally afraid that we were gonna somehow spring a leak like in the cartoons I did find it oddly satisfying And considering this pool is over 50 years old I wouldn't blame you if you're wondering why we aren't getting it resurfaced cause it clearly needs a lot TLC to bring it back and essentially I got some quotes to get it all redone and they weren't even remotely close to my budget unfortunately so it was either do it ourselves or don't do it at all which wasnâ€™t really an option the good news is I've stumbled across a professional grade pool restoration system and if we do it right we might get another 10 maybe 15 years out of it the bad news is it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better so come back for the update
