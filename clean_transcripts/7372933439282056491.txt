hello I'm Lisa and welcome to my farmhouse today I'm gonna show you how to cook eggs on a cast iron pan without it sticking if you've been in the home making home sitting space you've probably seen cast iron pans and they might be daunting to you they are a great non toxic way to cook all your food and the rules for cast iron pans are a little outdated I definitely cook tomato based products and I sometimes use soap dare I say to wash my cast iron pans I use regular dish soap which does not have lie in it so yes you can use soap but high heat will also kill any bacteria my pans are so non stick that they will not need soap on a regular basis so the first step would be to make sure your pan is scorching hot your pan needs to be hot to be non stick if you start off cooking by putting the food in the pan and then light the stove it is gonna stick so before starting and preparing any food get your your pan on the stove and get it warmed up then you gonna make sure it's oiled even if it's seasoned you need to put some oil in there my last tip would be not to move the food around as much as possible and that's it cooking with cast iron doesn't have to be complicated go get yourself a nice large cast iron pan to start out
