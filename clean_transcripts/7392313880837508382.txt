do your windows need to be cleaned do your homeschool lessons on them it'll force you to clean you're welcome for that cleaning hack by the way we are doing our homeschool lessons way late today because the kids spent the night at their grandparents house and didn't get home till lunch well I just wouldn't even do lessons today because my kids are typically in a bad mood when they get home I'm trying to get out of the habit as kind these days is a loss because they do spend a lot of time at their grandparents and that just can't be an excuse to not get our score so we're gonna get in a quick math and reading practice today but I'm not gonna teach anything I kept it super simple we practice two digit edition with carrying over your regular words we did some of our word cards and I did a read a lot if you pay any attention to education and school related news you know that reading is a hot topic right now because a lot of public schools are failing when it comes to teaching our kids how to read and as a former teacher I can tell you I was not properly trained to teach children how to read I spent the last year doing courses and trainings on how to teach my daughter how to read because she struggled so much through our kindergarten I am a firm believer that kids are gonna read on their own timeline you don't have to be reading at the end of kindergarten however I do you know what is so so important to provide good reading instruct so let this be encouragement that if your kindergarten or first grader isn't reading fluently it's okay focus your attention on providing high quality multi sensory reading instruction and eventually they will get in the meantime fill your home with lots of colorful books read a lot of read alouds and help them fall in love with learning
