like it's Harry Potter and the kids like it is not like it is this man is all this reminds me so much of a funny story that happened with my kids here in Charleston so Charleston has a few local celebrities we usually leave them alone we are very respectful but people like to say that you have not really lived in Charleston until you've had an interaction or have seen out both Bill Murray and Darius Rucker and I had seen Bill out before at like Riverdogs games or restaurants but never approached him but we were at the aquarium with my kids and my kids are 9 and 8 and at the time they were 8 and 7 and they had just started watching the Ghostbusters movies and they were upset Bill Murray's at the aquarium with Sean Brock and Sean Brock's whole family if you don't know he's like a really big chef here in this and I get down and I whisper to my kids and I go guys guys it's one of the Ghostbusters thinking they'll be super freaking psych they look over at Bill Murray who is fully white haired and senior citizen at this point and they go that guy's not a Ghostbuster he's like yeah yeah no he played Peter Bankman on unfazed he didn't really care about Sean Brock either his
