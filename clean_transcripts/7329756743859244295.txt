when I say we and I do believe in this era of AI and on the left is the image that Channel 9 used AI to write all of their shitty articles chests and enlarges them for no particular reason at all what type of technology are they using that would automatically do that and how AI is going to be used as a scapegoat for perpetuating and tolerating one such image reached 47 million people before X took action on it I'm sure they wouldn't be so quick to admit that they use the automation by Photoshop taking accountability I have a PhD in digital feminist activism but I think that this is signalling something much more sinister her chest as well during that process image based abuse is not new and I wanna talk about how women are some of the first victims of deep AI so they're trying to tell us that AI the internet obviously Georgie Purcell I personally don't buy it created this image where it cropped her dress and enlarged her chest violence against women in the coming years that it can be used to do this so I'll give you an example this week and then also to avoid responsibility for doing it I mean society they cut her dress and made it images and they enlarged her and what worries me is that because people don't fully understand AI yet what do you think it is a form of violence against women they're blaming AI for this type of news reporting sexism but they're very happy to admit that they have this miracle I truly believe we're just at the beginning of this I think that because AI exists and because these technologies exist who is an MP for the Animal Justice Party instead of facing up to it and improving their practices it's just one such way to exercise power and control over women and how those in power are actually able to get away with so on the right is the original image of her someone at Channel 9 has done this and who do they have on their team who is just letting that happen sourced an online image of Georgie to use in our story as a common practice and because they can AI software that crops women's bodies perpetuating this type of violence by using AI as an excuse and as a scapegoat we're just gonna say more and more how women continue to be the victims but listen to the excuse that Channel 9 gave our graphics department pornographic deepfakes of Taylor Swift emerge on social media the image was re resized to fit aspects had her body completely altered created an image that was not consistent with the original and deep tech and you know this week's victim is Taylor Swift I'm Doctor Zoe we're in our deep fake era
