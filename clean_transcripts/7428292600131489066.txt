I finally realised there's nothing I can do to be a perfect mom and there's nothing you can do to be a perfect mom either and I wanna talk about this in the beginning part of my parenting journey I absolutely bent myself backwards and into a pretzel trying to be the perfect Pinterest parent I tried to make every moment special I tried to make every event this life changing core memory exuding instance in my child's life and what it really just LED to was a bunch of burnout because maybe being a perfect parent has nothing to do with how much effort you put in maybe it has to do with a little bit of effort but it's not the perfectly curated bento boxes with the googly eyes sticks and the handwritten notes that you put in your lunch box everyday maybe it's not the elaborately themed jump castle that you hired for their birthday maybe something as simple as remembering what their favourite sandwiches and making sure that you pack that you know it wasn't until I started looking at my parenting through the lens of my children's eyes and not through the lens of this social media toxic perfectionism that we've been told we've been told that there is a way to be a perfect parent and it involves crafts and it involves matching outfits and it involves reading the books and doing the therapy and having hobbies because you wanna show your child that you have a life outside of them but also making sure that they know that they are your priority you know all of us and specifically all of us online especially as motherhood creators are in this performance of motherhood we are showing a performance because no matter how off the cover how pre planned all of your content looks like it is still content and I have at least seen behind the veil long enough to know that everything that you see online is a performance of motherhood and it very little has anything to do with the actuality of those people's day to day as mothers and it took me about 10 years to realise that if I sit down and really ask myself what I really wanted from my parents growing up it was to be seen to be heard to be appreciated to be loved it had nothing to do with the things that they did for me or the events they took me to or the experiences that I was able to do with them some ways this is a millennial issue this is a millennial parenting issue to the point where we have a mental health crisis in parents because we are fed all of this information all the time telling us how to be a good parent and at the end of the day I think being a good parent number one is up to the opinion of your child and number two has almost more to do with the connection and the relationship that you foster with them than any of the other noise and even though I still beat myself up about every little thing I do and every little thing I don't do I think I finally am willing to take perfect off the table I'm taking it off the table I'm freeing myself from the shackles of this toxic perfectionism that we require of mothers because in there's no way to meet it and although I love putting an effort for my kids activities and the kids events that's not the stuff they're gonna remember not really they'll remember you if you genuinely wanted to spend time with them that's it if you actually like them if you like spending time with them if you make the effort to spend time with them if you make an investment into their lives their friends their hobbies their interests if you make it known that you love them and that you aren't perfect because a kid doesn't need a perfect parent they need a present parent they need a happy parent they need a willing and able parent and and that's really the bar that's it the performance of toxic perfectionism is going to give us all a mental breakdown so today I give you permission as well to drop the act of being perfect and just be there
