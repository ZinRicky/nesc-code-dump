yesterday my husband and I were having a conversation about how I feel like my platform has become extremely repetitive if you're not familiar with my background I grew up pentecostal holiness I wasn't allowed to cut my hair I wasn't allowed to wear women's pants I wasn't allowed to wear jewelry the list of things I couldn't do is very long but I left four years ago and started sharing my journey out of legalism and into the freedom of the gospel online and grew a pretty good following from it I think a majority of the people that do follow me have come out of similar backgrounds uh similar denominations and high control groups it's been really interesting to see all different kinds of people that really resonate with what I have to say and my story out of legalism and just what the Lord has done in my life yesterday my husband was like Jen you're platform is always gonna be repetitive and it is reaching people and it makes a difference in these people's lives because this is what they're currently walking through and I don't think I thought about it in that sense since I did leave four years ago I'm like man I bet everyone is so exhausted hearing me talk about wearing pants for the first time and just the freedom that I've been walking in in Christ but I've been thinking about it and I think that I need to be okay with my platform being repetitive I think that sometimes I'm like ah I wanna give the people something new something different but at the end of the day this is a massive part of my story and where the Lord has brought me from and I am okay with being repetitive and hopefully it will make a difference in people's lives and I can share Jesus in the process
