so my husband and I always do a holiday staycation a little date night to get away from the kids have a little romance and I found the perfect dress on TikTok shop and I just came in and I tried it on and it's very affordable which is what I liked because you know we can't always be spending so much money on the like the holiday occasion dresses but what I liked about this too is it has a very classic silhouette it cinches you in right here and then it ties in the back so the girls are super supported very important but I'm just gonna pair it with like some cute black heels and I feel so glamorous and maybe with like a little bit of fur on top to cozy up this is a perfect holiday dress I knew when I saw it in the red it was going to be tonight very old Hollywood I loved it
