hey guys check out what my wife bought on the TikTok shop she originally bought it so that she could like quote prank my brother but as soon as I opened it I knew I had to have it also my wife said that apparently in our HOA documents it states that you can't have political flags in your front yard and I told her I'm pretty sure that violates my rights so I'm gonna do it anyway so HOA you're just gonna have to deal with it sorry and listen it's a good flag quality flag great flag wonderful flag
