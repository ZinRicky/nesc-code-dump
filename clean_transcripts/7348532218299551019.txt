Here's everything I eat in a day as someone that loves to cook but is also 37 weeks pregnant. I start off with some herbal tea and then take my prenatals. I hate the taste of water, so I mixed in some apple juice today. I was also craving some fresh pressed orange juice, so I made that and then got started on breakfast. Crepes are so much better than pancakes. So today I made a Robus tea crepe with some vanilla peach puree that I had in the fridge and topped it with some strawberries. These flavors together really hit the spot. I ended up making a banana date milkshake before moving on to making my lunch. You guys know I need to have my midday beverage, so today we did a blueberry vanilla iced tea for lunch. I wanted something just light and refreshing and super simple, so I made a crispy rice salad. I chopped up a bunch of vegetables I had in the fridge, which was cucumber, carrot, some purple radishes, edamame, green onion, cilantro, and then I had some leftover rice as well that I crisped up in my pan before adding my sesame miso dressing and also some chillies. I gave that a good toss and then remember that I also cut up some avocado so I added that on top. Had some errands to run, so for dinner I made a slow roasted Mediterranean lamb. Pop that in my Dutch oven with some Warming spices and let that go for about three hours. I wanted something sweet, so I cut up some mango papaya, and I made a coconut mousse with some coconut sugar on top. The lamb was close to being done. I made my flatbread dough and let that rest for about 30 minutes while I made my date Grandma Lauda. My lamb was tender and falling apart. I shredded it up and returned it back to the pot to soak up all the juices while I fried up all of my flatbreads. This meal, you guys, was so good. So I put down my flatbread, some lamb on top. My date Grandma Lauda added some fresh parsley and some chili. Also a sprinkle of sumoc. Wow. And then I was craving some cereal.
