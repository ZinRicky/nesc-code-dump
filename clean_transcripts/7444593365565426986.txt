I was talking to another mom recently and she was kind of opening about the struggles of being the primary parent and in her relationship specifically she is the soul not soul but primary parent and that's the way that they set things up from the get go he was gonna work she was gonna do everything that had to do with the kids and the house and they were fine with that now however several years later it's a lot more work than you kind of know what you're getting yourself into in the beginning and I think this is one of the really important things about sharing realistic motherhood content is that a lot of young women will get themselves into the situation where they agree to something that they don't really understand the reality of until they're in it and then changing the negotiating terms very difficult it's one of the reasons on here that I talk so much about different struggles of motherhood and the realities of stay at home momhood because I didn't want to end up here not saying I don't love doing it it just wasn't the goal for me I had different career aspirations and ambitions and I just kind of ended up in this life and although I love it I very much recognize the amount of work that's involved and I think if this is the life you want you will end up here anyway you know all things considered but there's no harm in preparing women who are going to lead a similar day to day life to me um about the pros and the cons and a lot of the cons have to do with the partner you choose to do it with I talk all the time about the fact that my husband is an equal partner in the home when he's home and I couldn't help but feel a huge amount of sympathy for this woman I was talking to because although she has similar feelings about her role her husband is never going to share them with her because it doesn't align with his view of what a stay at home mom is and what her job is but I can't help but feel like the women who are getting into that situation now have such a wealth of information and um advice from us big sister moms on the internet that maybe they're negotiating the terms a little bit more favorably for themselves in this whole domestic partnership that's my help
