me and my husband purchased this knife set when we first got married in 2016 and they have been serving us good for so many years I did have a friend come over recently and she tried to use my knives as we decided to cook together and she's like when's the last time you sharpened your knives and I have to admit that I don't chop up my knives and I just muffle on through anything I need to cut I have been noticing that we've been having some issues cutting tomatoes lately but I just you know just keep muffling through it's okay no need to sharpen my knives so when I saw this on TikTok shop I knew it was something I had to grab the magnet holds a knife in place so it's super easy to sharpen your knife just roll the roller up and down and then they're all sharp and ready to cut for another eight years
