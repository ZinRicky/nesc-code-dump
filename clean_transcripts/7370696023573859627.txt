some of y'all are getting confused on what the modern day tradwife is Emphasis on the modern but still very much high key traditional in this sense that she likes to take care of you her home, herself she's very feminine but she still values herself and she doesnâ€™t handle disrespect The modern day trad wife loves to cook, clean take care of her home take care of her husband but she still might be a little unconventionally traditional or untraditional she might have tattoos maybe she's a little freaky but she still does not handle disrespect just because she likes to cook and clean for you and take care of you does not mean that she doesn't value herself she's still expresses herself freely however she would like because the man allows her to be in her feminine energy I don't know, if you want 100% tradwife go back to the 50s the year is 2024 so you have to take some of the untraditional with the traditional in order to get the full package Times have changed You might still find a woman who is the hundred percent traditional route but in today's day and age you have to accept some of the untraditional to get the traditional Once you realize that that not so cookie cutter woman becomes your most rewarding prize in life
