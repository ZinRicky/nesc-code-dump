Iâ€™m constantly amazed how many women think feminism is a good thing women have been so lied to feminism was created to separate family we valued our sense of independence so much that it took away our strong sense of family unit Kids are being raised by government child care women are working just as many hours as the men are but are still expected to go home and take care of their children it's a 24/7 job to be a woman living in America this isn't the American dream the American dream is living off of one income The man provide and we depend on them The American Dream would be woman taking care of themselves, the home, their children, their husband Women are meant to be gardening, cooking good food, nurturing the ones that they love. That's when women get a strong sense of self and when they're in their true feminine energy that's when they thrive you cannot convince me that women were meant to work a 9 to 5 job just like a man is you see other women being taken care of maybe they're cooking they're taking care of the children and they're being there present and you think wow, I would love that when a woman is in her soft feminine era she thrives and that's what any woman wants sSociety has brainwashed us to think independence is a good thing when in reality it just breaks families apart now don't get me wrong I think feminism can be a good thing (supporting women) but I just feel like it shouldn't have come at the cost of losing the family unit nobody has a strong sense of family and why is that? I would strongly suggest that feminism, independence women girl bossing a little too hard took away the strong urgency of having a family
