I guess she says the Barbie movie I think and it looks at gender roles in a very playful and fun way experience the complexities of sexuality and gender identity Kaiser House can be for men as well as for women and everybody in between it's the idea that women or men have these inherent predetermined kind of traits and she agrees to a certain extent if you know what I mean and a whole bunch of other things different genders can all co exist she likes pop culture when it attempts to empower women not just on women but on men and I guess men actually being able to properly protect and provide it also enhances gender inequality because it positions these um can be expressed differently among different people and shouldn't limit us Shakira has branded the Barbie movie as emasculating there are many ways to be a man or a woman or a gender diverse person it shows that all these different types of people from different backgrounds the Barbie actively tries to subvert gender norms which is that like you can't empower one the Barbie movie showed all of these different ways of expressing oneself biological destinies then and if you are a boy mom as Shakira is because you don't understand that actually and her arguments do lean somewhat into gender essentialism because of this or types of relationships that they might want to you're going to be more likely to think that any sort of we do a number of things we limit the individual freedom of people that's what is so clever about what the Barbie movie does which is the mindset that it seems that Shakira has um and conditions for how they should act and behave in society it shows how crippling the Mojo Dojo oh my God now for the Barbie movie when we distill people's essence down to their biological sex and one's gender without limitation with different interests um which is probably why if she thinks like this tries to move away from a reductionist conception of male versus female empowerment for women is at the detriment of men and move away from these type of gender essentialist views and what that does is it challenges the zero sum game mindset but if you insist on seeing masculine and feminine as predetermined sometimes I just really wish celebrities wouldn't speak because this reduces people humans expectations and standards based on their sex like social conditioning basically saying that without robbing men for their possibility to be men and it basically said that this kind of femininity or masculinity empowerment and respect can co exist and are not mutually exclusive she had a problem with it like sexes as in opposition to each other all of the time so let's talk about gender essentialism like new interest or hobbies or careers this is like kinda ruining my childhood so Shakira is which ignore the complexities of the human without losing our femininity that the way you are is predetermined by your biological sex because people feel that they can't explore things that the Barbie movie critiques the limitations that are placed specifically you might think that that's at the expense of your sons that type of movie is empowering your sons as well as our daughters without losing our essence so gender essentialism essentially the empowerment of one gender should not come at the expense of another so she wants to give women all the tools and the trust that we can do it all gender without diminishing another and it questioned the limits that have been put on us individuals to a set of expectations and standards Shakira has a problem with the Barbie movie and Barbie movie also looks at diversity this kind of binary notion of gender as we know can be really harmful I thought her hips didn't lie wow okay Shakira said that her sons absolutely hated the Barbie movie she says that she wants her sons to feel powerful too and that Barbie didn't adequately portray male power
