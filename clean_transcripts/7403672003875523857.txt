I wanna talk about aging gracefully and blake lively hear me out because you know how you say like aging gracefully and they always talk about women when they usually like talking about women they use that term and it's talking about like their looks but when I think about aging gracefully I think about how can I make sure that my mind stays open how can I make sure that I stay curious how can I ensure that I continue to challenge my assumptions and like the generation that I was born into and stay open to the ideas and I guess I guess not feel threatened by the ideas of like the next incoming generations and when I see those interviews that Blake Lively has been doing I just think now that is someone who is not aging gracefully so she is a couple of years older than me and I just feel that you know she has stayed in a time a simpler time and maybe she was always a simple girl but she stayed in a simpler time and I think she wants us all to be there on her level with her well while she's trying to control the narrative because she's not actually intelligent enough to rise to the occasion in this particular instant because I think that aging gracefully is about being committed to always learning and always being better and I think that is becoming very clear how rapid she is and it's a really really interesting example of what happens when people are told they are so so so good looking they are treated so special they never have to experience adversity or they don't have to develop normal level of empathy and they can just stay in their own little bubble and their own little echo chamber and have their own preexisting ideas confirmed back at them time and time again and it just reminds me that all of the challenges that we face in life they do build us up and make us better and make us stronger because I would by far prefer to be someone who has lived through a whole lot of crap and pain than be someone who's 36 presenting the way Blake Lively is presenting right now like that is my worst nightmare my worst nightmare and it should be yours and aging gracefully is about having self awareness I mean just thinking about the interview with like the rings and my comfort blanket and going on that Tangent about what she's wearing it just shows that it was never that deep for her and yeah she played Serena so well because she was Serena and maybe she played that at such a young age that she became that character or maybe she was always that character I don't know but it's about having Grace and I think that she has given no Grace to she has not honoured the survivors who impacted by this film she has not honoured the story and she is not moving with any Grace around like all humility um in the promotion of this she's trying really hard to become an icon but it's coming across as really out of touch and you realise that icons are icons because they are actually really really smart they know how to read the room they're not just talented musicians or actors or whatever they also are smart and know how to read the room respond to social discourse they are paying attention they are paying attention they're not just paying attention to themselves they're paying attention to the world around them and acting accordingly and I think in this day and age if you wanna be an icon you have to do that because again it is not that easy to control the narrative anymore people are very media literate now and people can see through the crap
