no but fr that seriously is one of the worst parts when you realize it's not that this person um wasn't understanding that they were hurting your feelings it's not that there was a miscommunication happening um they knew all along they 1,000% knew what was happening they knew that they could just keep you running in circles keep this argument going and you're gonna stay and you're gonna take it and that's where like the accountability comes in and you have to recognize okay I was participating I was having the same fucking conversation for five 10 15 years and I stayed waiting for five 10 15 years and that's another reason why a lot of people just choose to stay it's easier to stay and pretend like it's working and everything is just chugging along and you can continue to lie to yourself in your head than it is to say I've been lying to myself all these years I've been acting like Imma do something acting like I got boundaries and shit and I just been letting this person walk all over me I've been allowing it to some degree I've been participating there is no fucking award for who put up with the most hurt in a marriage there's no fucking award there's no rewards at the end of what the end of life is death at the end of this the end of this relationship if you stay in it it's death so you just never fucking get to have a good life you never get to feel happiness you never get to feel loved or feel like you fucking matter you're just forever perpetually just giving to somebody else that's your whole fight like no no way that's why I I don't care what the other option is it's better than being in a loveless miserable marriage because that is just it's such an empty empty feeling that there's nothing it there's I don't I wouldn't wish it on anybody I would never go back to that life if I could I literally have made it my life's mission to encourage people to escape because I I get it now I get it it's worth it
