American women say men go to foreign countries because they're trying to look for poor women who will submit to men, wife them up because we do not submit to men who have nothing. If you judge password bros then you should consider that your argument is not valid, and your misconception on foreign women is demeaning. There’s still successful women in foreign countries they submit to their husband, they’re feminine and they’re traditional. A lot these women have better education than western women. So guess what, they're educated, they have careers, and they're still feminine, traditional and value men to lead in the relationship. They’re not feminist. How many women in the U.S. are single mothers and live off the government and struggle? A lot right? There’s a lot of uneducated, poor women in America too. So that argument is invalid. One thing I've noticed, is women who ask for the most usually have the least to offer. If you’re a woman and you think men go to foreign countries because you think “foreign women don't know wiser” Who’s really the uneducated one You should consider western culture as the problem. Not the women being uneducated or poor and that's why they submit.
