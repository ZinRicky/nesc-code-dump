I just woke up and I'm at my boyfriend's house and he's asleep in the other room but I wanna answer you my relationship with my children changed after leaving my marriage because I no longer had like you say this partner that I needed to tend to like whenever we got in an argument and it was all the time it's this cycle of abuse this toxic cycle so you know we have the big blow up argument and then it's gonna take days to sort that out the feelings and everything and in those days I'm not really gonna be present with my children because I'm so distracted at the hurt and pain and confusion of what's going on in my relationship so you know I'm spending my days kind of pushing my kids away like hey yeah yeah yeah can you go do something else can you do this can you do that cause I'm trying to like hide from them and so you know I'm tryna hide my feelings from them I'm tryna hide what's going on from them cause you know you don't wanna fight in front of the kids so there's just like the whole relationship with the kids is very superficial cause I'm hiding so much from them so the minute I left I had no choice but to be authentic and vulnerable in front of them there was no longer anything to hide behind I no longer had this relationship that I was running behind closed doors to argue about I now had to like just be there and be present with my kids and it fucking paid off like I know when you're trying to hide arguing from the kids you kind of you also hide your emotions cause you don't wanna be like oh I'm crying cause Mommy and daddy got in an argument so you're just like you know constantly hiding and lying everything from your children so there's no way you're gonna have that deep of a relationship they can feel that you know I don't I don't know you know and so being able to be completely honest and vulnerable with my kids and you know they no longer could see me as this super mom I was now a total human they could see me cry they saw my weak moments they saw me when I'm like I don't know I don't know what we're gonna do but we're gonna figure it out so I think they have been able to see also how much I love them to what links I will actually go to to support them to be there for them to give them not just what they need but make it happy and fun so also like even the mundane moments in our house are no longer eggshell scattered all over the floor just our regular average shit in our house nothing special just that is healing and nice because we're not waiting for someone to come yell at us or tell us what we're doing wrong or you know so yeah literally being in a shitty relationship is going to keep a separation between you and your children and when you finally make the choice to leave and decide well I have these children that really need me and I'm gonna put them first and put myself first the relationship is literally what I dreamed of so hope that helps
