did I get the day off is it gonna be a homeschool with dad day psych dad lasted through one subject before he said how the heck do you do this everyday for those of you who think it would be easier to stay home and homeschool than to go to work all day you are sadly mistaken it takes a heck of a lot of patience and a whole lot of Jesus get through the days but I would still much rather be home teaching my own kids than at work teaching someone else's kids all day but I do appreciate those days when Logan gets a little taste of what it's like to be me all day I definitely could not do what he does all day and he definitely cannot do what I do all day but that's what being a team is all about and today we all did a little tag teaming with our lessons and yes I know it's Labor Day and we could have taken the day off but we've only done lessons four days out of the last two weeks and we don't have plans until this evening so why not get some lessons in the best part is that the kids loved playing teacher to dad they taught him what we do and how we do it and we even taught him some new reading skills he had no idea what syllabication was or what open and close syllables are but don't worry Madison taught him all about it and now dad is as smart as a second grader
