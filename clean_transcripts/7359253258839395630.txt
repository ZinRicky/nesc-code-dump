Who? Did I hit a nerve, Heather? Because this is, like, the fifth comment on this video. But if you're so happy with your man, your man, your man, and he's providing you with so much, like, why aren't you at yoga or Pilates or, like, doing some cute craft with your kids? Why are you in my comments where I make money from this? This is my job. So why are you all up in my comments arguing about how great your life is?
