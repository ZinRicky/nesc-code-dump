So excited to try out this new camera from wise. Going on a trip soon and I need to make sure I can see what's going on in my backyard. It is. Camera moves 3 60 and that it's weather resistant is just perfect what I need. I'm also super impressed with the picture quality and how easy it was to install. Just look how it rotates 3 60. When I'm away from the homestead I really wanna be able to see what's going on with the animals. And this camera even tracks the animals. Look, it's tracking my cow so I can be anywhere in the world and keep an eye on my baby. It even follows the dogs in the backyard. I can keep an eye on everyone. And with the app I can record and save any clips. I have other cameras and I'm super impressed with this one. And with the price you can't beat it.
