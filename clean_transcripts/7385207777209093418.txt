you do realize that if you are smaller than extra small you can still fit into the extra small like it might be a little bit loose on you slightly unflattering but it's not the same thing has been larger than the largest size if you can't fit into an XL or XXL (in typical straight size retailers) whatever you're done like you physically could not get the item of clothing onto your body there's no amount of like altering that's gonna make it fit you if it doesn't fit you doesn't fit you that is like in no way shape or form the same thing as like skinny people not being able to fit into a size xs an item of clothing being too baggy for you is not the same as it not literally being able to go over your body 67% of women in the United States or more are plus size if I'm not mistaken roughly like 19% of the fashion industry caters to plus size women do you do you see I don't I know math might be hard but I'm gonna trust your ability to understand that there's an issue there I don't know why people are on Twitter arguing with me about this before 9:00am I'm going back to bed and I pray that when I wake up y'all have developed a little bit of common sense thank you
