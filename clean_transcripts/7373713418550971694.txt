fat people are constantly told that once we lose weight we will finally be happy but the thing is unless we do the work to learn to love ourselves at whatever size our body is losing weight isn't gonna fix all your problems overnight sure it might help but if you don't do the internal work just becoming smaller is not gonna fix all your problem but that is a lie that we're constantly being told and it's really sad to see people who are continuously told that lie finding out after they've done all that work that is not actually true weight loss will not fix your problems if you have not healed yourself
