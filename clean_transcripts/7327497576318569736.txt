I'm back because it's an emergency - Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie have both been overlooked in the nominations for the Oscars this is the highest grossing film of the year that we're talking about this is the film that the Oscars nominated for Best Picture so I don't understand I like call me crazy I don't know I don't understand how this works but I would have thought if something was good enough to be nominated for Best Picture that the director would also be nominated because they directed the best picture so I'm Doctor Zoe I'm eating my lunch I have a PhD in digital feminist activism I make accessible feminist content for people who wish to further their feminist identities and I'm really angry I'm really angry about this because don't you think the Oscars like the Academy whatever they called should be embarrassed like embarrassed that they have so poetically made the point that the Barbie movie was already trying to make if you think of such a good point to make why would you nominate the director who directed it the actor who started at Margot Robbie no no no you're just gonna go and nominate the man as if to make the point that women are constantly overlooked we have to work twice as hard to get the same recognition that men do and our interest is sidelined consistently by the patriarchy if that's the point you want to make you've made it but guess what the film that you neglected to nominate properly already made it so aren't you embarrassed these people are supposed to have their finger on the pulse okay well the pulse is saying that Barbie was a milestone movie it was a milestone film good films are made all the time but Barbie is one of those films that will go down in history was it an flawless academic execution of feminism as a whole no but was it a very important cultural milestone that reappropriated a doll that has often you know been used as an idea to oppress us revolutionise that idea and turn it in something that can empower us and started so many important conversations made feminism very accessible and made a statement that we're here and we're fucking tired and we're over it and it made all of these kind of feminist points very very well flawlessly and an aesthetically pleasing way it was a beautiful film it was extremely well executed it was funny and it was poignant and it was a culturally important moment how how can this be overlooked in this way I do not understand I do do they not know things like do they not understand what's happened do they not understand what's happening in society right now or do they understand it all too well and they're afraid of it and they're afraid of us
