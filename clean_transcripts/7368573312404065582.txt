For breakfast today, I couldn't decide whether I wanted something sweet or savory, but I did know that I want bread and butter, so I made two variations of each. I started by scoring my blueberry lemon sourdough loaf that has been proofing in the fridge for a couple days, placing it in my Dutch oven before adding some ice, popping the lid on, and baking it for 45 minutes. While that was baking, I decided to get started on my butter. Whipped some heavy cream until my solid butter separated from my liquid buttermilk, and then I squeezed as much buttermilk out before running it under cold water and setting it aside for the savory version. I wanted to make a ramp and chive butter, so I blanched my ramps and then chopped them up really finely, did the same with my chives, and then realized that my bread was ready. So I pulled my blueberry loaf out and scored my plain sourdough before popping that one in the oven. For about 50 minutes that was baking, I combined my ramps, chives, and some flaky sea salt with my butter before rolling it up in some wax paper. I placed that in the fridge and moved on to making a sweet butter to go with my blueberry loaf. I decided on a browned maple vanilla salted butter, which is one of my favorite butters. Now, melted it down and then whisked it, and once it was ready, I placed On a plate I had some beautiful heirloom tomatoes that I was craving. So I added them to a plate with some olive oil, salt, pepper and some French radishes that I had, and pulled out my sourdough loaf and let it cool, and then breakfast was done. There's nothing better to me than a fresh loaf of bread with some butter on it. And this hit the spot.
