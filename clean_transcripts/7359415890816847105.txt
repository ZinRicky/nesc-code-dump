let me tell you you have to work for them here it is I got it all printed seeking just it's not really about feelings ever since I got my PhD and started calling myself Doctor Zoe and saying hi or I might have bought my PhD or the Phds don't mean anything anymore and yes so I put that all together and then yeah so you have to like sit in front of judges like I had sometimes when things are gotten to the wrong side um bitch sessions to hashtags but also take a chance for people who might be interested in doing your PhD I just had to do a few edits and then resubmit there's a couple of ways you can go about doing a PhD like you have to find a supervisor who wants to supervise your PhD because they allowed women to understand that they weren't alone through forms of affective solidarity and justice seeking my topic was digital feminist activism then you have to write it all up 80,000 words and it's very niche and very specific I describe my PhD digital feminist activism pretty fun if you have a spare 5 years and I thought that the way that they spoke was sometimes just so beautiful my examiners were the people who wrote a book called Digital Feminist Activism I think that this is a really interesting topic I wanted to explore the role of social media in contemporary feminist movements me who me too I've had people tell me I made up my PhD and these were poems by my um and you can apply and say I love this one my friend came up with this and then you have to submit it to two external uh there are Phds that you can get that are a little bit shady and a bit of a scam I didn't have to do too much to change my PhD because I was getting a government scholarship to do it I'm Doctor Zoe and I have a PhD in digital feminist activism it took me like five years I got minor revisions which is really good here is the kind of structure lip review methodology yes I invented my PhD and then you have to pass each of those milestones you have to present everything transformation and consciousness raising for contemporary feminist activism that's kind of how they work how cool is that and yeah and I just wanna like clear that up very you know so keep in mind I'm in Australia and um and then yeah transform survivor stories into hopeful politics small group processes from the 70s or just in a really short way I guess like write it for them or contact them or bribe them or something it's still taken I mean as a very serious thing so it was very relevant they are like the leaders of their field if you know what I mean but it just happens consistently um chapters and then my it's about seeking justice and then the university and the academics have to approve your supervisor my friend designed this cover for me but in Australia it's very arduous process existing PhD that academics have put out there in the world I wanna do it and then yes something really interesting happened super cute yeah transcription so I took my transcripts and I turned them into poems but basically it's on a pre designed topic which were the backbone of feminist movements or you can come up with your own topic to understand how they really work and then for me I also had to apply through the government as well it's usually about 80,000 words and it's really intense I wanted to explore how social media operates as a type of public space I love it what actually happening on social media today because it's really hard to describe what your PhD is actually in it there's probably a lot of scope for like how you do it and you basically have to say like look to further feminist discourse the other cool thing that I decided to do was this thing called poetic it's called just feelings and it's all about so they had to also approve my topic mine were like both overseas academics in the US and the UK can learn actually how to start your own bitch session cell group if you want um it's open to the public and they ask you questions but were a part of a systemic structure of patriarchy this one was just about feelings pretty much you have to do three milestones in that time and yeah I got my PhD and as you can see the universities are there and there it is and I wanted to show it I think it's really important they do not hand those things out it's called solidarity rage and justice um I recommend doing it participants academics not allowed to know who they are in case you in my niche area and they loved my PhD and I went a little bit crazy now whenever I say that I know it differs in Australia and then oh yeah so that's what I did I came up with my own topic basically I got a scholarship to do my PhD and said we need this done and I think there's a gap and I want to do my PhD in this topic um and then yeah that was the vibe and I wanted to understand the impact of hashtag feminism on feminist identities you can either do a pre I started getting trolled so this one was about feminist rage in the digital age how feminist consciousness raising haven't really ever been trolled that badly before and I would bore everyone if I actually try to explain what it was about it's a gap in the research at the start of every TikTok video basically and then they put that cute hat on me and I had a theory that feminist consciousness raising I think that in the US and so I put these poems from survivor to the middle of each of my chapters
