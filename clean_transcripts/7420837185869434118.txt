Come on, my beloved relations. I stand here today a voice for freedom, a call for healing. I prayed, oh, I prayed for freedom from the ancestral pain passed on through time. I asked for strength to forgive, to heal the scars, both yours and mine. I found freedom, my people, and the breath of our lands and the strength of our spirit.
