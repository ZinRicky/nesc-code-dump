I'm a 22 year old Gen Z track wife and I like to wear historically inspired fashion. But everyone on the internet keeps telling me that I need to dress my age, that I look like a granny. So my followers helped pick out some outfits and I decided to try it. I tried the straight jeans, sneakers, slick back hair, layered necklaces, a tank top, and honestly not a fan. Even though it was a fun experiment to try something new, I think I'll stick to what makes me feel most comfortable, and I hope that you'll do the same!
