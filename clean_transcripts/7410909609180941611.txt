Would you date a conservative? No. No, no, no. Why not? Yeah, cause I don't hate myself. Oh, my god. Like that. I think he's like. I mean, I don't think he's a conservative, but like, that was. That's the rule. I'm a big on my values and morals, and conservatives values and morals typically don't align with that of mine. I really value the people that I date and I want them to value me the same way. And I think that politics is very personal and for me, I really have a hard time separating the two. For me to really love someone and for me to feel like I love them, I feel like we have to rely on certain things, for certain morals for our relationship to work. That's a hard line for me. I just couldn't marry someone that would consciously vote against everything that I stand for and my existence. That's a hard no, no.
