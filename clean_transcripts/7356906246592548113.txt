I've been hearing a lot about micro feminism then I wanna add some of the feministy micro feminisms that I like to drop in to everyday conversation. Firstly, teach a man to fish this actually comes up a lot men like to bring up the classic idiom slash moral teaching teacher manta fish and you whenever men bring this up, which is weirdly often and I'm sure you'll start noticing it just the way that if you get a car you start seeing it everywhere you will start noticing how often men bring up the teacher manta fish analogy. I interrupt and say teacher manta fish and you emasculate him I think that this is a far more superior moral teaching to any other teacher man to fish metaphor. It is far more accurate than any other one I've ever heard. The teacher man to fish metaphor was clearly invented by men because women know that if you actually tried to teach a man to fish as a woman, he would feel emasculated and you might die or at least you would suffer from being patronized and or kicked out of the fishing club. The next one is quite simple. I merely just asked men to bring me things and when they specify what things I say I don't know things the next one uh, is just that whenever god comes up, I refer to her as she or they for example, what star sign are you? Me. I'm a Gemini. Oh, so you're a two faced bitch? No, I believe that when god made me a Gemini, she meant it in a multifaceted bisexual way. Next one. What were you wearing? When men tell me a story where, you know, something happened to them that was unpleasant, I simply ask, well, what were you wearing? You can expand on this. Why were you there? Were you drunk? It sounds like you're asking for it. You get the picture. The next thing is that if I hear a man talking in an angry voice like on the radio or on TV or just in general, I just simply refer to him as shrill. Does the trick.
