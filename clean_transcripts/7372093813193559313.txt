okay this comment had me gag so I wanna talk about what the hell a Schrodinger's feminist actually is I'm Doctor Zoe and I make accessible content for people to further their feminist identities let's get into it so this person's clearly been reading some Reddit threads where this kind of term was invented but it's based off of this guy called Schrodinger who came up with this concept which is now called Schrodinger's Cat he proposed Schrodinger's Cat as a thought experiment in 1935 so the cat was used to basically illustrate this concept in quantum mechanics of a living entity being able to be both dead and alive at the same time so there's a cat in a sealed box and there's poison ready to be released and as soon as one single cell in the sealed box disintegrates which is gonna happen inevitably over time it will cause the poison to effectively be released into the sealed box and the cat's gonna die the idea is that the unobserved cat is therefore both dead and alive at the same time so then Shrodigger's feminist is used to describe the idea of a feminist who might be using like outwardly one part of their feminist identity saying that they're a feminist but then inwardly behind closed doors not actually living to their feminist values this person has used it to kind of minorize the victim survivor narrative of the feminist we literally have already done that like we already call victim survivors victim survivors for a reason to acknowledge that these identities are complex you might be technically a victim but you might not wanna be further victimized so you want to take that story make your own and feel empowered and a sense of agency and control over your narrative so we talk about in the positive as well survivors and we kind of let people decide themselves how they want to identify within that they might not identify as being a victim they might not want that label for the rest of their life so I really wanna talk again about patriarchal bargaining here because patriarchal bargaining is the idea that in a patriarchy which we do live in women are constantly navigating these power structures um trying to figure out which ones they need to use in the short term medium long term to get by to survive um given that we do live within a society where men have an unequal share of power resources and money so women might choose to in some ways you know say okay I'll accept power money resources from men because in the short term that allows for me to survive and thrive um but in the long term I am a feminist and I'm fighting for equal rights cause I actually wish I didn't have to let me use the analogy of a woman approaching her wedding day she wants to take control over her wedding day and take some of the traditions that she you know aligns with and then reject some maybe more patriarchal traditions so she decides that she doesn't want her dad to walk her down the aisle because she doesn't like the idea of a man giving her like chattel to another man however she needs help to pay for a wedding day and so she accepts help from her father who is the person in her parents relationship who has the money and has control of the money and so she accepts help from her father because there's a patriarchal system there whereby her father has majority of the money in the family and controls the resources but she rejects more you know older traditions that she doesn't identify with as is her right to do does this make her a bad feminist for accepting the money from her father well this person might say so I'd be interested in what you think basically choices within a patriarchal society are complex I believe that both accepting money from your father for your wedding and choosing for him not to walk you down the aisle are both things that can exist at the same time um within a patriarchy within the choices that we have to make um and within like patriarchal bargaining and that's okay comments like this don't really take into account the economic and social realities of existing within a patriarchy they don't acknowledge the fact that we might have ideals and we might have standards and we might have you know an imagination for a better future but that is not the reality that we currently exist within so we still need to make less than perfect decisions pragmatic choices within a less than perfect world there's a difference between individual decisions and systemic change we might believe in the ideals of systemic change but still have to make individual decisions that don't always line up perfectly with those ideals I think it's important to have empathy and understanding when we're talking about feminism and discourse around this I don't think it's particularly useful to pick from a 1930s kind of quantum mechanics male theorist to try to I guess frame feminists as these fake people who are just who are just using feminism for their own advantage I think that when men do that it says more about them and how they navigate the world than it does about feminist as a whole but I think that these are nuanced complex conversations and it's up to us to have them it's important to have them that's why we're all here um let me know what you think
