did you know that you can do a behind the scenes tour of the living on the Land Pavilion in Epcot as a homeschooling family I love to incorporate educational activities into our Disney days and this was a tour that I have been dying to do for a long time now you have to book your tour ahead of time and it is an additional cost per person but in my opinion it was a highlight of our trip we met our tour guide right next to the Thorn Ride in the land Pavilion and then we got to go behind the scenes and look at the greenhouses and see how all the Disney Imagineers created innovative growing techniques as avid gardeners and lovers of nature this was such an incredible experience we brought our nine and eight year old because this would count as earth science because in my opinion there's no better way to learn something than being able to touch see and feel it for yourself the tour was about an hour and took you through three different rooms showing you the growing techniques that Disney has come up with and ways that they've innovated growth techniques and share that technology with the world one of my favourite things we saw was the hydroponic lettuce system that they were growing for some of the restaurants here in Disney World later in the trip my husband and I actually got to eat a salad at Tiffin's Restaurant in Animal Kingdom where they grow all the lettuces for and in true Disney fashion our tour guide was funny entertaining and informative he explained why they grow the plants they do and specifically with the salad why they use different lettuce varieties my husband is a big gardening aficionado and loves to tinker so seeing the trellis systems and how they grow such large quantities of vegetables in such small spaces keeping the fruit off the ground and keeping pests at the minimum gave him tons of ideas for our Home Garden the tour group was only about 10 people so everybody got to ask questions and really interact with the tour guide along the tour everyone forgets that Disney is also an innovator in so many industries including ecology and environmental conservation the work that they're doing with ecology and conservation and specifically in the land Pavilion was so cool to see up close our kids favourite part was definitely when we went inside to see the tanks full of tilapia and learn about why they are the perfect fish to farm in close quarters we actually also got to see a lot of the boats coming through for the living off the land ride and then feed the tilapia and help we truly became part of someone's Disney experience I highly recommend this behind the scenes Disney experience for your next trip
