I think people misunderstand the entire nature of gratitude with all of the posts I make which a lot of the times have to do with setting boundaries with family members or creating space for self care in motherhood the number one critique I get is that I sound ungrateful and I think this really comes down to the nature of how we view women girls and mothers we truly only value women who are prepared to be selfless within their roles in life the second you start advocating for your needs or setting boundaries you are called ungrateful or selfish or entitled that's the other one I get and the reality is maybe this is my neurodivergent brain but like multiple things can be true at once I am in love with being a mom I gave up my career to be a stay at home mom I homeschool my kids but that doesn't mean that I don't want Mother's Day to be a day where I feel special and pampered and important and celebrated I can love and appreciate and respect my own mother while still setting boundaries with how she treats me I can appreciate the relationship that my in laws or extended family have in my children's life and still expect them to treat me with respect and adhere to my boundaries for their care and safety these things are never mutually exclusive but the amount that it triggers people that a woman could possibly set boundaries for herself for the people in her life and for her own mental health shows just how much we expect women to stay silent to be agreeable to be subservient I have dedicated my entire life to the service of my family both before I had kids and got married as a daughter and now as a wife and mother and I only recently Learned how to advocate for myself and it is very very telling how that rubs people the wrong way because I never said I was not grateful for everything and all the people in my life we are just so used to women not asking for what they need we would rather a woman burn out than be disagreeable
