so I'm going to a 2014 party with my voice gone and one thing about me is I'm authentic because I have my Huda beauty like mauve lipstick that I got in 2014 or probably somewhere around there but also I took it a step further because yesterday I got my entire face waxed and I don't know if you can see but well it doesn't come on camera but I have so much redness and so many patches on my face so acne 2014 2,014 me I'm back okay I changed the black glasses um cause that's very 2014 Tumblr I think and added a black velvet choker that's red cause I'm wearing the red flannel over my one direction shirts jeans with this black Jaden's I don't know it's giving 2014 Tumblr to me wait sorry I forgot the side part how would I forget the side part oh and I put on my signature this is literally from when I was maybe 12 my favorite scent putting it on now I'm so happy I'm thriving
