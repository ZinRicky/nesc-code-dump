I don't care if you don't believe in zodiac signs because like as a Leo I am so beyond utterly obsessed with myself and genuinely cannot fathom the idea of people like not liking me and not liking themselves frankly like I just it doesn't compute in my brain and like it's not just like a confidence thing it's like a way in which I perceive like the world like this is a thought process that I see specifically in LEOs like yes I'm cool yes I'm kind yes I have a reason to like myself but like are you gonna tell me that being a Leo doesn't contribute like I just there's nothing about me that I like I look so beautiful it's 7:00am I haven't slept I'm back from the club like my makeup is coming off and I'm just like wow I'm the most beautiful person to ever exist why because I'm a fucking Leo
