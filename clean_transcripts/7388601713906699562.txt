I have been looking for the perfect pair of boots for a long time. I wanted something that would stylistically have that old fashioned look to it but still had a thick tread for hiking cause we were coming up to North Carolina to do some hiking. After weighing all the options that are out there, I ended up with these which are the Ariat Paddock boot and I've been really happy with them.
