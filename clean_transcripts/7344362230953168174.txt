I’m constantly amazed when other men have the audacity to call a woman names like the B word or even other vulgar language even if it's in a joking way, if you as a man have the audacity to call me a B word ADIÓS you're out of my life, like my dad I don't care if it's a joke, it's not funny, if you're my man then you should honor me and respect me and never call me out of my name your role is to protect me, not only that, the idea of someone else calling me the B word should trigger you as a man why are people thinking it's a joke or laughing at it? it's not a joke and it's not funny If you think we're too sensitive for feeling like this then news flash good men do not call women B words Good men know right from wrong we as women shouldn't apologize or make ourselves seem small for wanting the basic respect and decency to not call us vulgar names If you’re a respectful good man, you wouldn't call us any names that are not our own. It’s not cute, it's not funny do not call us the B words.
