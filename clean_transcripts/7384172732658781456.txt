I'd like to know when my beauty ended for you this is one of the most powerful statements I have ever heard on this app I'd like to know when my beauty ended for you Doctor Zoe I have a PhD in feminist consciousness raising and I wanna talk about it because it's about when the male fantasy of you drops away are you treated differently when he sees you as a person as a person as a human or less than when the fantasy drops we've all experienced it to some degree does he treat you differently you are feminist and what I mean by that is is your conscience feminist has your feminist consciousness been raped well our feminist consciousness is raised with me notice a gap there is a gap between our humanity and reality a nice man will tell you that he has a wife and he has a daughter and he was raised by a single mother and he respects women but that is not what he means when he says that he means I respect the women in my life who give me love affection and attention I respect the women in my life who I can protect I respect the women in my life who I see value in I respect those women I don't respect women we've all gone from being one of those women to being a woman who he doesn't respect anymore because we're not behaving because we're using in a a body in a way that he doesn't agree with because we're too loud or too opinionated because we're no longer a woman who he sees value in or who he can control then we notice the gap and what happens when we notice the gap feminist consciousness is raised we get angry and you know what what happens when women get angry we are propelled by kind of a productive feminist rage and feminist rage is contagious feminist rage is contagious because we start talking we start acting differently acting how we want using our opinions using our voice like this creator is describing in her video when we start doing that the gap widens because we're no longer acting playing the part that men expect of us so more men begin to disrespect us the truth is peeled back and then we talk more we get more angry and other women see that and then other women start noticing the gap and then they start talking and they start acting up and they start being who they wanna be not playing the part ascribed and then they notice the gap because then they notice what it is how they're treated when they're seen as a bad woman back up then widens for them then they start talking feminist rage is contagious feminist consciousness propels the movement it is not an individual process it is a collective process it's a process about solidarity with one another being a feminist is a becoming it is a constant becoming it is a collective process a constant collective process of becoming of raising consciousness in ourself and then in others so that's why I ask are you a feminist
