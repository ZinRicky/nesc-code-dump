plan a week of homeschooling with me we are back from our weekend getaway and I'm dropping right back into Ma mode and prepping our school work for the week in case you're new here hi I'm Chelsea a homeschool mom to a first and second grader our homeschool style is eclectic and we switch up how we do school based on the seasons this week is Shark Week and we're doing a shark unit study we've done this two years now and I love seeing their growth when I pull out the activities from the previous year I know it might seem redundant but each year they always get something new out of it and they're so excited for it when it comes to planning I'm a paper planner girly there is just something about writing it all out that brings me so much joy this year I'm using the Erin Condron Homeschool Planner for the first time my only complaint is that it's undated apparently I was not paying attention when I ordered it because undated planners drive me nuts I just do not want to have to fill in the calendars in the days of the week every week oh well they are too expensive and I'm not buying another one I'm also a big fan of erasable pens because I make a ton of mistakes and I changed my mind a lot and I have tried out a few brands but I haven't found one that I love yet so if you have any suggestions for erasable pens let me know right now I'm trying out the pilot friction I don't know if I'm saying that right but they're fine liners they're very similar to the Papermate flare pens and they erase really really well we'll see how long these last my biggest complaint about erasable pens is that they stop working so quickly this week I'm planning for language arts math science Bible and history my kids are really close in age and ability so we do a lot of family style learning which makes it easy to plan and execute every week fellow homeschool moms I wanna know what is your favourite subject to teach and what grades are you teaching this year
