I know your boyfriend doesn't hit you. My boyfriend didn't hit me, either. And I wasn't one of those stupid girls that could get abused. Except it's not stupid girls that get abused. Abusers do pick really strong, smart, capable, intelligent people to abuse. We're kind of a bit of a conquest to them. It's an adventure to see if they can break us. You were not stupid then, and you're not stupid now. You were abused.
