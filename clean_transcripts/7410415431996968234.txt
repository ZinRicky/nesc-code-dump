Men will be like, oh, I love how you're always glowing. You look so beautiful the second you put on lotion. They're like, Ew, gross. You're all slimy. Why do you think I'm always glowing? It isn't magic. It takes work to be this glowy. In fact, come over here, because I think you're looking really dry. Oh, like it's the end of the freaking world. Guys wouldn't do anything but put lotion on themselves.
