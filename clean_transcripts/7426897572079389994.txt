I don't think my wife has ever initiated sex in the last seven years. How do you feel about guys, like, getting pursued? Just as much as women do. Okay. I don't care if you're too tired. I don't care if it's been a long day, tried from work, whatever it may be. The kids are too loud. Initiate intimacy to your partner before some other woman does, if it's. Especially if it's important for them. Okay. If they're telling you, hey, it would be nice if you came up to me and occasionally wanted it, do it. What are you waiting for? Okay. Which is? Need. It just needed to be said.
