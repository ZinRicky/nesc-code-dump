let's braid my hair together while I tell you why I love braids so much okay to start off you can see I have bangs that are growing out they're almost chin length and when they are chin length I'm going to cut them back to my forehead but very light so for some reason my bangs got super thick over time and my plan is to cut them back but only like half of the hair so that I have some nice face layers and then very wispy bangs second I have a lot of sensory issues I cannot handle it when my hair feels like it's being pulled for most of my life ponytails pigtails buns claw clips they just do not feel good and also give me a headache so that's another reason why I don't do most hairstyles that pull my hair back from my face two braids is the hairstyle I have done for probably the past decade that has kept my hair out of my face and not pulled it weirdly but also braids are just they fit my aesthetic well they work really well for head covers but really the main reasons why I prefer braids is because they keep the hair out of my face without pulling it and bothering me I really haven't found another hairstyle that is as convenient as you can see it's super quick and easy to do I face a lot of criticism for wearing braids people think that I'm like trying to make myself look younger or vantalize myself but the truth is I don't think that hairstyles should have an age I think we should be able to wear whatever hairstyles we want to wear at whatever age get used to it because I'm going to be 60 with gray hair red hair and long braids
