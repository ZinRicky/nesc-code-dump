Stop hating your period and treat yourself! This is my famous salted caramel mushroom latte. I make it every cycle because my body is in need of more carbohydrates versus the beginning of my cycle where I really focused on carnivore and animal based. This raw milk has every mineral that you could possibly need, along with my mineral salt. Apparently I forgot to film the caramel, but I put it in the blender with the mushroom coffee. Also, is it caramel or caramel? I don't know. Comment below. In a culture that demonizes being a woman, I treat this time of the month like a vacation and really treat myself.
