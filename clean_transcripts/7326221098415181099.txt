I am not one of the astrology girlies but I do like it whatever I feel like a lot of people their New Years the calendar year when the numbers change they're like oh my god all these horrible things are happening my year starting off horrible no the energetic year hasn't begun yet this is the last of the gunk of that last phase clearing out and come spring time in April when the energetic year starts and you're gonna be ready so even if your year seems to have started out shitty a few bad things have happened no we're not gonna paint the whole year as shit because in January a couple weird things happened January is still Capricorn season we gotta get all the way to Aries before we start a new energetic year so just lay low take it easy trust that you know what the fuck you're doing trust that you are in control of your life and you're good you're good you're good the whole year is not fucked because January had a couple missteps you you were just finishing up the last year you got this I'm on your side I love you
