People always get so mad at me when I say “I love when I let my partner lead” why does it affect you? it doesn't Not only that I'm happy I love when I listen to my man and do what he says and not in an oppressive toxic way but in a he's smart I trust his judgment I trust his character and generally he has my best interest at heart so why wouldn't I listen to him? why wouldn't I let him lead? if you are with the right man you will follow him blindly wherever he leads you
