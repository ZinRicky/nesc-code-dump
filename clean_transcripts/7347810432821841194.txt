four years ago I made a decision and the complete trajectory of my life has changed because of this decision I grew up pentecostal holiness and if you're not familiar with that it's its denomination that is very strict they follow a lot of extra biblical rules I was never allowed to cut my hair I couldn't wear women's pants I was only allowed to wear skirts and dresses no makeup no jewelry you get the just of it four years ago I left legalism and decided to actually read the Bible for myself and figure out what the word of God actually says in the process of all of that I started sharing my journey online started with primarily Instagram and then over the last few years I've also grown on TikTok a little bit I met my husband we fell in love we got married we won a 50 thousand dollar wedding in honeymoon for free we bought our first home and have been fixing up this house for the last three years in may and because of my social media stuff I was able to get a job working with a Little House on the Prairie literally a dream job I work primarily for Dean Butler aka Manly on Little House on the Prairie I am his social media director I run all of his accounts and this week is the Little House in the Prairie festival in Simi Valley California where they filmed Little House in the Prairie I'm flying out to LA tomorrow and I'm so excited but I say all that to say this one decision that I made to leave legalism and to follow Jesus has completely changed everything in my life I probably would not have married my husband cause I was not allowed to marry anybody outside of my denomination we wouldn't have won the wedding for free we wouldn't have bought this house I wouldn't have grown on social media because I wasn't gonna be talking about leaving legalism I wouldn't have gotten a job working for Little House in the Prairie and I wouldn't be flying out tomorrow my entire life has changed and all of these things I didn't deserve any of them Jesus just gave the extra stuff just because he's good I was telling my husband last week that it's just so wild because He has made dreams come true that I didn't even know that I had the Lord's plans for us are so much bigger than anything we could imagine for ourselves leaving legalism was one of the hardest things I ever did but it was 100% worth it for the sake of the gospel and follow who Jesus really is God is so good, guys
