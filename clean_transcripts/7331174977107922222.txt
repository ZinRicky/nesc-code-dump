You know Latina woman get such a bad rap! which I've never understood we're fiercely loyal, loving, and usually exceptional cooks so what if we're possessive jealous and fiery? I'd say the good outweighs the bad so if you're with a Latina woman not only will you always be fed but you'll always have that fiery passion in the relationship whatâ€™s not to love?
