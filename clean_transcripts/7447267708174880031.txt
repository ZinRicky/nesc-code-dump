in case you needed a reminder that normal houses look lived in and good moms are messy this is it as much as I try to do it all I just can't I can't homeschool cook nutritious meals keep the house clean and do all of the laundry all the time so my house looks lived in 24 seven because three out of the four of us are here pretty much all the time and even though I'm a stay at home mom and don't work outside the house my husband has zero expectation of me doing this all on my own there are some days that he comes home to a clean house and a home cooked meal but there are more days that he comes home to a complete disaster whether the disaster is the house or me he never knows I like to keep him on his toes but today I used the four hours of free time I had while the kids were at farm school to deep clean our master bedroom I need at least one space in my house completely clean because it's off limits to the kids until after Christmas it might actually stay clean
