one of the worst parts about being an adult is making plans with other adults because the thing is I as a person with ADHD and I don't really know what I'm gonna do until I'm doing it you know what I mean a day of is usually when I know what my day is gonna look like and you know my mood or whatever just like things pop up like today I have to go to spectrum because my internet for some reason is out but like I never know what my day is gonna look like until it's like the day that it's happening and having to make plans like days or even weeks in advance just like does not work for me so now I'm here and I'm like my plans got cancelled so I'm like okay let's make new plans let me text like any of my multiple people that love me that I like spend spend time with it that you know my friends I'm gonna text any of them I have texted and called so many of my friends and they're like oh um it means 6:00 so like I understand like I get it I get it but I just like one of the things that I didn't really appreciate enough about college is like living in dorms with my friends and like just being able to be like hey let's do something right now like I really I don't know why it gets so hard make plans day of as an adult but I just I I cause I'm the type of person who if someone calls me day I'm like yes and if there's other things going on I honestly could probably cancel them but like that's that's not how it works being adult so anyways I don't know what I'm just this is I'm so sad that I can't like call my friends and make plans now I have a bunch of plans now for the rest of like my my week in like 30 minutes my week my week has been full now cause I every person I call they're like oh I can't do today let's do this day I'm like okay cool cool cool cool so my entire week is now booked till Sunday but I have no one to hang out with today so I don't like adulthood
