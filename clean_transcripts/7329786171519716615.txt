there's been this cultural milestone of a movie is a perfect feminist text so when we see like a director like red and I my view on it is actually that as feminist away from it especially in light of the world right now we know who these people are I don't think it's a helpful narrative it is not one movement to compare that to the Oscars as a child or as a gender diverse person or even as a man feminism is a broad concept we get angry or in a particular industry or from a particular background have seen some of the worst things we've ever seen in our lives um and a gn0c!de and conflict which is very much gendered and the way you reconcile your truth with the way the world is to the world around us we talk about it and we comment on them with that feminist consciousness and that feminist lens what does it mean for women and families your lived experiences and your circumstance what you're born into I feel like I'm going crazy seeing what's happening I feel completely gas yeah it was was it significant as a feminist text months with the genocide in G@z@ and what's happening to the Pa|e$t!ni@n people and there is no world in which I think it's appropriate when we're looking at such a gross violation of human rights a stain on our humanity I don't think it builds empathy so we can observe and ask and whether or not you like it what does it mean without it having to be the worst thing in the world and I believe we can intersectional feminism is really the only valid form of feminism it has a lot of power this has happened over here I don't think it adds to discourse it is something where when our feminist consciousness becomes raised it's a process Hollywood is big intricately linked with global powers that be and world conflicts indeed and we have a feminist consciousness are all going to impact on your experience as a woman or as a diverse as the Barbie movie no so feminism needs to exist across many different planes but intersectional feminism is not one thing either and I think we've moved is she genuinely not a very good director and when we get angry across many levels there were just other good directors contradictions at once in the same way what does it mean that countries like the US across time space so remember when you're little and you get some dinner that you don't like it's still a culturally significant moment in a particular place and time it's absolutely it brings in the body I think most of us we begin to redirect the shame and blame turned inward on ourselves does it mean that the Academy is sending a message affecting families so when we raise our feminist consciousness on that individual level sex in the city was significant as a feminist text and all of those things will impact upon the way you see the world I don't know we begin to see the world differently so feminism needs to exist across many sound waves it's a process the power it has is in but it's a concept we observe these things it is beyond was it a really accessible feminist moment and the power it has yeah it was just in the way that it's embodied we need to be able to comment on those so yeah you gotta eat it anyway we aim to reconcile our own so I've noticed that many people are what does it mean for relations in the Middle East what are our roles as feminists very much disproportionately affecting children there are kids in Africa who are starving comparison is not intersectionality but did it resonate with a lot of people comparing the discourse about the Oscars and the Barbie but this is very common trope that they're scared of us we look look at it we watch it even though sometimes it really can feel like it is we might ask the time you're born into does it mean that there's unconscious bias the place the family it's okay to ask those questions about pop culture moments affecting women that they don't respect it the UK are funding a gn0c!de I believe that we can hold all of those things and all of those what can we do about it experience and our own truth with the world around us so what is the role of feminism it brings in rage and when we notice that they don't line up on many different levels it is not owned by anyone person or any one group uh feminism is not one entity it's okay to observe and ask these questions it is taking up a lot of our air time in our space movie with G@z@ and P@lest!ne there is no words for what's happening in G@z@ I mean and that might mean something how is this happened over the last few weeks and seeing the gas lighting that's going on around it feminism is a tool of discourse so when we are feminists it does not operate in a vacuum well too bad and it asks for action but what we wanna do is we're going okay informing your feminism or are they sending us a message that they won't be having it they're in our consciousness I don't know about you that's relevant to particular people one group one message whether you're an individual or a group or a family even though they seem trivial and they seem silly we need to be able to have so many different conversations at the same time we have every right as feminist to ask why and what does it mean we begin to observe the world and ask questions we observe cultural moments how we got into this you're going to have a variety of layered lived experiences geographically was it simply an accident and your parent says or one movement a girl we snubbed at the Oscars I don't think it's an intersectional way of looking at the world either but it's not very inclusive and it's very problematic it needs to acknowledge that it's a transformative process
