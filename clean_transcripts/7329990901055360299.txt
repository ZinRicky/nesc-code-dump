I will never forget the first time I made friends with a mother who was around my age before I had kids because she told me one of the still to this day most useful pieces of motherhood advice at the time she was a stay at home mom of one and I was in my very early twenties just go get ready off camera but she told me that once a month that she would go to the movie theaters first she would go to the bar have two margaritas then she would go to the movie theaters by herself watch a whole movie before coming home and that's not my particular brand of self care but what the moral of the story was is that as a mom it is okay for you to do things every now and then that are alone that are just for you oh shout out to Winky Luxe 2 for the lip today see Matt what is this skinny plump doing matte lipstick so however you get that self time whether that's painting playing video game reading a book going and doing margaritas and movies it's important to take time and service to yourself as well
