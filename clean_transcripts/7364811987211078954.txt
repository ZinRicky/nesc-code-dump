ten years ago this month I was diagnosed with five different chronic illnesses one of them requiring me to have major brain surgery and my neurosurgeon told me I was two weeks away from being paralyzed from the neck down over the last 10 years I've done a lot of different things to try to manage my pain levels for these chronic illnesses but the biggest game changer for me has always been food since I've changed my lifestyle and the way that I eat everything is better my sister told me about this company called Remedy Organics a few months ago and I have been drinking all of their products for the last few months and I'm obsessed I reached out to them about a month ago because of how much I've been enjoying their gluten free and dairy free products that are all organic this has been the best addition to our fridge
