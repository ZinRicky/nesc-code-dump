finding your personal style is not just about learning how to dress yourself it's also about a sense of confidence and self expression in which case it is an amazing form of self therapy because living in alignment with your inner self is not just about how you behave how you carry yourself and the way you manage relationships it's also about how you present yourself to the world no matter how you choose to dress or style yourself you are telling people something about you before they get to know you personally so when you find an uniquely you way to present yourself to other people you're filled with this sort of like self alignment you know you're showing people who you are and you're living as your inner self so because of how unique human beings are that's never gonna look exactly like somebody else you can absolutely find people with similar styles for sure I have a couple on here and I love to see what they're wearing but it's also gonna feel uniquely yours their take on it is not gonna be exactly the same take as yours and the pieces you curate for your wardrobe and for your styling are not gonna be exactly the same as theirs and the trickiest part in my opinion isn't finding out what your personal style is although that is a challenge it's having the confidence to actually live in those clothes to actually live the life as that person because it requires a certain level of confidence to not dress or behave or adhere to the status quo and that's why the older I've gotten the less I fuck with trend cycles I don't follow trends because a trend is basically just a group of people telling you who you're gonna be this month and maybe some of it sticks but don't get me wrong trend serve a purpose I think they can be a really fun way to try out new things without the social stigma of being different therefore you can try on different types of styles and different attitudes without have really having to risk much and if you've made it this far in this video I'm sure some of you are gonna go look through my page and be like oh why would we listen to her about style her style sucks and you know what probably would suck for you it would suck for you because it's an expression of me and that is kinda the point
