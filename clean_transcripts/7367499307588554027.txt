I think what Erin Hattimer is doing is absolutely phenomenal like she is genuinely doing what she can for the cause and she is using her voice and her platform as a way to support people of Palestine but bipoc creators have been talking about what's going on Palestine for months for literally months since October (and before) and the impact that this one white creator to whip up all the other big creators into shape and get people talk about Palestine is just so fascinating to me like she is definitely showing what it means to be like an ally especially like a white ally to BIPOC people but just like the fact that like these creators needed a whyte person to tell them like I it's just it's wild to me but again I'm grateful that she's doing what she's doing and I'm grateful that now there are other people with big platforms that are speaking up about it it's just that's all it took yeah I don't know
