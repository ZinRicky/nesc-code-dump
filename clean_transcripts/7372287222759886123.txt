When making dinner tonight, I realized we were all out of our condiments, so I decided to do a little restock. Today we're making some ketchup, ranch, barbecue sauce, and hot sauce. So I started with my ketchup, combining tomato paste, some honey, vinegar, and water, simmering that on the stove before pulling that off and letting it cool, and I moved on to making some ranch. I like a lot of herbs in it, but you can tone that down if you want. So I chopped up some parsley, dill, chives and combined that in a bowl with some mayonnaise, sour cream, some whole milk, and gave that a good mix before adding in some lemon juice and cracked black pepper and salt. I adjusted the seasoning based on what I wanted before putting it in the fridge to chill. For my hot sauce, I chopped up some Fresno chilies, added some garlic, black pepper, corn, and vinegar, and diluted that with some water. Then I simmered that for 20 minutes on the stove while I made my barbecue sauce. I combined the ketchup we made earlier with some brown sugar, vinegar, and some other seasoning, and letting that thicken on the stove, and once it hit the thickness I wanted, I transferred that over to a bowl to cool. I blended up my peppers and strained them. I was pretty happy with my hot sauce consistency since I wanted it more runny. That's how I prep some of My favorite condiments
