I'm a stay at home wife and I get asked all the time, what does your husband do for you? And I just felt so loved tonight that I had to share. I am in a production of beauty and the Beast with my local community theater, and I have a three hour rehearsal that I have to drive to town. To town is only 30 minutes away. But I've already been in town today. My car is in the shop, so it won't be my car, it's my husband's truck. And I just did not feel like driving into town to go to that rehearsal. But I have to go to rehearsal and I asked my husband, hey, would you mind to drive me into town? And my husband does not normally drive me into town. It's a three hour rehearsal, but he said yes. And I just feel so loved that he would carve out that evening to drive me to my rehearsal. He's not even spending time with me except for the car ride there and back. But he's gonna stay in town, do a couple errands, and I. I just feel so loved. And for anyone who says that's the bare minimum, my husband does so many things for me. He's had a long day at work today. There's no reason why he should drive me into town except for the fact that he loves me. Anyway, I just wanted to share that because I love My husband and I just wanted to give him a little shout out tonight.
