yesterday so we're gonna start a series called Trauma Tuesdays where I like unpack my childhood trauma with my therapist and then like make light of it with you guys to make myself feel a little bit better but I also mentioned that I've been having like a lot of nightmares and dreams and that is what I need to unpack so last night I had this dream and I wouldn't really say that it was a nightmare just like a weird don't want that to happen dream so in this dream I for some reason didn't finish my college degree and I have to move back to my college town to finish out my college classes but the catch is it's 10 years later I don't have the same friends I don't have a place to live and my parents have to watch my kids for the six months that I'm there like where's my husband and all this he is never in my dreams and I don't know what that means but yeah he's just never there so in this I have to go back to college and my parents get custody of my kids now I like don't know what the significance of this is because it feels like it shouldn't be that important but it probably is and like I don't know if it's because college is like that time of your life where you're so excited but you're kind of unsettled it was for me and escape out of my home life but also like what comes next because you I felt like I didn't know like do I go back home do I go somewhere else I did go somewhere else I did not go back home but you spend four years not knowing what after college is gonna look like also in college my junior year I got a call from my mom that she had her third DUI was going to go to jail for a few months and that was like my turning point of okay I am never going back to PA I do not wanna be in that environment again whatever it cost like I am moving and that was when I made the decision to come to Florida so I don't know if like that's what I have to like go work through I don't know but it is just such a weird dream
