Tracking my menstrual cycle for five years, monitoring my basal body temperature and cervical mucus. Instead of my old school basal body thermometer, I caved and got the ring from thermometer. Literally half the price of a ring and basically does the same thing, but tracks all of my fertility signs and my sleep cycles. Our menstrual cycle really is our fifth vital sign, so it's essential for every woman to be tracking it.
