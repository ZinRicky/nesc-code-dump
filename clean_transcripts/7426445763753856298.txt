moms all over the internet are sharing their 17 diapers in reference to that mom who was struggling in postpartum to take care of herself her toddler her Newborn because her husband wasn't home and ended up having kind of a messy house and what they're sharing are the realities of postpartum depression postpartum anxiety and postpartum psychosis and I personally have found it incredibly cathartic I have heard I haven't shared mine on here yet but I've talked about it before on here about my struggles with postpartum anxiety because the people who are shaming the mom for having a dirty house have no idea the depths of the struggle of what it means to fight your own mind and fight demons within your own mind they're out of your control when I was in the depths of suffering from postpartum anxiety I wasn't sure if I was going to make it make it out you know what you see on the news is always the worst case scenario you know the mom who finally snaps who either analyze herself or her children but what you don't see often is the most commonplace scenarios which is the suffering and silence that so many women do you know a lot of moms are prepared to be sad have the baby blues or whatever you wanna call it but what I wasn't prepared for was panic attacks anxiety intrusive thoughts some of the like most horrific things rolling through my brain as scenarios that I either were gonna cause or had to find a way to save my babies from and I just hope with the invention of social media and how prevalent we are at sharing the realities of motherhood that we are preparing the next generation of mothers to know the warning signs and see the most common place struggles of postpartum depression anxiety and psychosis before they are drowning and before the worst case scenarios happen because we all know it's gonna be up to us as a community and us as individuals to prepare other women and not the systems that we have in place to actually support women but I know for me it has been incredibly healing to see these being shared online so maybe I'll share mine soon or maybe this is me sharing my 17 diapers
