You know that saying that all women say that goes like, “if he wanted to, he would” if he’s not willing to do nice things for you, another man will! my nephew asked me does this supply for men too? like absolutely! find a woman up to your standards. he was like if she won't do laundry or cook for me find someone who will? yeah sure she doesn't go to the gym with me and work out find someone who will? yeah find someone who will.. and I'm looking at him like it sounds so terrible coming from a man right? but us woman do this all the time it made me think I'm not sure if this rule necessarily applies for everyone/everything but maybe it does?
