it's time to lesson plan for next week except we only did school two days last week so I'm really just rewriting all the things I planned last week for this week last week was my daughter's birthday and things just came up that I wasn't expecting so we didn't get nearly as much done as I'd hoped for and honestly this week is a little crazy too with closing on our house but we're gonna try to get some school work done I would much rather have a plan and not execute it than not plan and wish I did I'm going into this week with the expectation that it is going to be thrown off but just in case it isn't I'm red when I do my lesson plans I plan for the perfect week and what I mean by that is we get every subject done every day plus all the extra activities and honestly this very rarely ever happens but I plan this way so I'm ready for anything I plan for our main lesson plus enrichment activities in case they need to go a little deeper and extra practice in case they're kinda struggling with something and then each day I decide what we're gonna do based on our motivation and our attitude because let's be honest there are some days we just wanna get through school and move on and then there are other days where kids are enjoying what we're doing and they wanna do more and you never know what you're gonna get until the day of so I plan for both scenarios that does mean there's a lot of playing on my part but I think it's worth it and it's what I signed up for
