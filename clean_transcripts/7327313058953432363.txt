I switched into my very new vintage style not vintage values crew neck to make this video because it's freezing but I wanna elaborate on my previous video because a couple people thought I was blaming the trad white content creators for the behaviour of this man so let's get into it there are people that will be radicalised by the media that they consume and that includes social media and not all trad wife content is created equal there are plenty of people who just share their life recipes home setting etcetera and then there are content creators who talk about how it is a woman's place and god put women in these roles and this is what good wives do those two things are not equal that is the type of content that I disagree with fundamentally simply because I have a different value system and that type of content is very dangerous for people who have like very small media literacy because when you look at social media it is very easy to forget that a very big part of social media is entertainment and that applying the standards of content creators that you see online to your everyday life is harmful not just in this context but in many different contexts as well like y'all remember a little while ago when we were all collectively losing our minds because we couldn't tell if really very Crunchies account was satire theatre or actually real that is because we couldn't figure out how to process that kind of information and that kind of media within our brain there are already men who have a great deal of this misogynistic tendency is internalized already what I'm saying is when you see a female content creator who makes this very fantasy esque content and then tells these men through their screens that this is what they deserve this is what a good wife looks like it feeds this monster within them that already wants this sort of confirmation that what they want isn't shitty and again what they want isn't shitty as long as it's not being forced upon unwilling partners or leading to verbally abusing the very independent woman you're already with that is purely the fault of the man for not being able to a enjoy casual social media content b not understand that fantasy versus reality is different and see not recognise that the value systems that you got married under were part of your agreement when you got married those things can change but discussing that with your partner is your responsibility not cheating and verbally abusing them because you've changed your value system I think all of this also feeds into the entire conversation about social media as a media form how content creators show up and show either theater or authenticity and how we figure out the difference and how to consume that media because certain people will be affected by it more and more harshly and bring that into their real lives than others
