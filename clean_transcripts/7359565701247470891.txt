Come with me as I go to WITS, the women in Travel Summit hosted in Utah, it was a jam packed weekend of women learning from each other, sharing, collaborating, networking, and exploring the great outdoors in Utah in both Park City and Salt Lake. Not only did I get some really valuable information about how to grow the travel side of my content, but I got to experience some of the coolest things about this part of the country the natural beauty, the adventure, the shopping, the food, the culture, the history, the art. I will definitely be coming back to Utah, and I cannot wait for next year's Width Summit in New York.
