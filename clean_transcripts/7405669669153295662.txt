I am confident I call out fatphobia because I have the ability to I can call out fatphobic comments because I have the strength to deal what type of comments that I got on the internet there are plenty of people who get those comments and it breaks them and it hurts them cause I have been that person in the past I show up for the people who do get hurt by this and just because I can handle fatphobic comments doesn't mean that I deserve to or should your fatphobia doesn't impact my confidence but if very well it can impact others the way which y'all treat fat people is not kind or just and I will always be someone that calls that out worry about your own confidence
