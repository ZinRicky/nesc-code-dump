they don't make plus size clothing because they don't want us to look good I firmly believe that one of the reasons why plus size people do not have access to cute clothing is because it would be much harder to contribute to the myth that fat people are unattractive and ugly and lazy and slobs and like whatever if we actually have clothes that fit us and make us look good because so many people do not have access to cute plus size clothes I spend a lot of time a lot of money and a lot of effort looking for clothing that I think is cool and fun and unique and interesting fits my body right and that is a privilege that I am able to do I'm able to have that privilege that is not the case for every fat person so a lot of the time the clothing that the average fat person has access to is either a one of like frumpy frocks that they give us or it's like slightly too small and I don't care what size you are I don't care if you're small or big whatever like you if the clothing is like ill fitting it's not going to look very good on like obviously I think you can pull it off I know plenty of people that like wears tighter clothes and looks perfect on them but like generally speaking if you're trying to like fit your body into pants that don't fit you or clothes that don't fit you that's not always the most the most like flattering thing you know what I mean like the muffin top that everyone is so afraid of that happens because your pants are too small so your stomach fat like peeks over and when you're wearing pants that fit your body that doesn't happen so then we get this like stereotype of fat people like stealing small people's clothing and like always squeezing into sizes that are too small and da da da and it's like they we do that people do that because they don't have access to clothing in their size you understand and I just don't think that you're able to like maximize your slay if you're trying to constantly find clothes that you can squeeze into instead of just by being able to buy clothes in your size and we can have a conversation about the politics of flattering clothes another time but the reality is when fat people wear clothes that aren't flattering it automatically like deems us as ugly to people but again that's a lot of people's only choice if they want like trendy stylish clothes and like for me it's on issue because I am like on the like the larger end of the plus size spectrum so I don't even have the option really to like squeeze into tighter clothes but I understand if you're like on the smaller end of the spectrum if you're like a 1416 and you really wanna wear this one item of clothing and like you know it's a size 12 you wanna squeeze into it like I understand that you know what I mean it's just like not fair it's not fair that you have to do that and like if we don't wanna do that the other option is like have you been to a target section for plus sizes like they have wild and fable I shop a lot of dresses from like wild and fable which is like their regular kind of youth ish line um and online they go to a 4X and I look really good in those clothes I love them but all of those plus sizes are not available in store the plus sizes that are available in store are Ava and Viv and Ava and Viv is just literally like cottage core but like derogatory actually you know what it is it's Little House in the Prairie core it's like shirts up to here dresses up to here like frilly big boxy like no shape it's it's I hate it do they relegate fat people to like either squeezing into tight fashionable clothing and it looking ill fitting on us or wearing clothing that's in our size and it's just like not flattering it's like from the 18th century and it doesn't look good no one wants to wear it and so obviously perpetuates this kind of myth that like fat people can't dress fat people like can't look cool they can't look stylish and it's like you're not giving us the option to and personally I think that some of the most fashion people I've ever seen in my life are plus size because we have to do that work to like put in that extra effort to look stylish if if you wanna do that as a fat person but it's just not fair that that's what we have to do and I truly genuinely believe that at least a small reason why the fashion industry doesn't make plus size clothing that is cool and fashionable cause like literally all you have to do is make it into plus I make the straight sizes plus size all you have to do and the reason they don't do that (my theory at least) is because then they can't say that fat people don't look good cause like we do like when fat people wear cool clothing like first of all you're more like you're more attractive because you're more confident I think that's a big thing sorry I'm literally just ranting but growing up like there's a period of time where all I really shopped at was macy's and Walmart because that was kind of the only place that I found clothes that fit me but obviously like the clothes weren't cute especially back in like 2000 you know 12 13 14 whatever like it was old woman clothes it was hideous hideous like obviously I was gonna get bullied and the moment I found torrid and like say what you want about it now but for me in like high school torrid was like torrid was it that was the first time that I had seen clothes that were even like mildly trendy in my size and I have such a vivid memory of going into the torrid dressing rooms for the first time and finding a bra that fit me and it wasn't like a sports bra it was like an actual bra with cups and it was blue and black pattern and I cried in the dressing room I cried positive for the first time in my life in a dressing room because I was like oh my god like this fits me and it's cute it was genuinely one of those experiences that I it's a flashable memory I I to this day remember how I felt when that happened and literally like my entire like attitude shifted after that like because I started wearing clothes that fit me well and that were cool and like I had autonomy and it genuinely made such an impact on the way that I felt about myself and that was then and obviously like things have changed in the fat fashion world but I just know for me how important my fashion is to my confidence and just how attractive I think that I am in my opinion generally the right outfit is the difference between like a 5 and a 10 like I'm BI but I'm not attracted to one like physical attribute I literally am attracted to people that like wear black and like wear alternative clothing and like the style that like the style that people wear genuinely will make me attracted like that's besides the point style and fashion is so important and I think that letting fat people have autonomy and like have the choice to look cool and look fashionable and dressed the way they want is so revolutionary and the fact that we're walking it back now is not lost on me and I just like cause that's the only thing that makes sense to me because what other reason would the fashion industry have do not cater to plus size people considering that 67% like two thirds of this country is plus size and like we are only like 20% of the market if that anyways this has been long enough I can talk about this for literally ages but the fashion industry just doesn't want fat people to reach their full potential and I am 100% certain of that
