a new school year is about to start and I am seeing a ton of homeschool families on my for you page but you know what I'm also seeing a lot of beautifully decorated homeschool spaces and let me put you on to the real side of homeschooling this is our home school space and it is literally right here in our dining room and we do most of our school lessons right here in the living room so if you are about to start this homeschool journey and you are seeing all of these beautiful homeschool classrooms and wondering how the heck am I gonna do that please know that you do not have to have a designated homeschool room to be a successful homeschool mom
