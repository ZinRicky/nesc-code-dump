taught Laura Ingalls and she's written you can read about her in the books um my godmother was a teacher in a one room school room in Mendocino California which is a very small town wow so I just like I felt like I was doing honor to my godmother my mother was a teacher wow um so I I no I could never be a teacher I was a travel student right that they were people that were close to me in the family that yeah I think I was doing it for them yeah and you and you loved it oh I love playing it I loved acting yeah you know I had been acting since I got my first part when I was 19 wow with and was that bonanza what was your first part was the Loretta Young show okay and that was about 1961 um I was about nineteen so yeah I started real early and I did all of those with Westerns the bananas and Gunsmoke Medical Center FBI my three sons that's your father you know and you were just having the time of your life doing all that I thought it was a dream was it a dream come true for you yeah well you know I never really thought about it when I was growing up I didn't say I wanna act yeah but I was a very bad student in high school and I wasn't gonna be able to go to college wow because all my friends were going to Yale and Harvard and I saw an advertisement on the back of teen magazine and it was for the Passagena Playhouse the State Theater California and it was Earl Hall and it was a former student there and so I thought I can do that so I sent away for an application wow and I was accepted and then I told my mother and she said well we'll see about this and we drove to Pasadena and she was very impressed wow I mean it's a seven story building it's got six theaters in it I would have to live in a dormitory wow so it I mean it was everything that she wished for me get away from UVA City live in a dormitory do something new yeah she had no idea what it to do right and um and that's how it started and I got my first job at 19 on the Loretta Young show wow with already young perfect love that sounds so good so out of all the episodes cause you were in four seasons what was your favorite episode to film maybe not what was your favorite episode like overall or both what was your favorite episode that like sticks in your memory when you think about Little House and your time on Little House of life I loved filming that episode that was so much fun okay it's gotta be when Miss Fetal marries pig farmer and you know if they actually gave this beetle a whole episode yeah you did you had your own special little moment exactly and now you deserved it Allison did too now Nelly meets the pig farmer's son Luke and falls in love with him and you know it's a whole story about how she she she gets to marry Luke and then Missus Olsen comes and you know blows it all apart so it's fun to do I bet that was a fun time and also because the actor that played my husband my boyfriend on the show um the actor that that played the Pig Farmer was the student at the passing in the playhouse when I was there so we had known each other since we were 17 that's why your chemistry works it was great we were best friends for years and here it is you know he gets to play my

was my friend on the set and we used to go to um retreats together we went to you know spas for the weekend and all yeah she was um she was one of my best friends she seems she I I wish I could have known her she seems like she was a wonderful lady she was wonderful yeah and she was outrageous on the show four years was it about four years of you of you filming um what is one of your favorite memories of Michael Landon I know we've talked some about your audition um overall but and and how you got the part to begin with but do you have a specific favorite memory with Michael um first of all he's one of the best directors I've ever worked with he's a family man and what he what he like to do was shoot in a way so that we were done by 6 o'clock at night I was on all these shows where they would work until midnight bring us in at six in the morning I don't know how crews even had family lives but Michael had Michael was family man so he shot very economically and I love that so I I enjoyed working with him but I'll tell you my best friend on the show is Victor French oh Mister Edwards yes we became such good friends and I think I I spent more time with Victor than anybody really
