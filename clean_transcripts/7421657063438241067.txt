  I hate to be the one to break it to the Billy's of the world  but your own mother may very well be one of these murderers herself we know that 25% of women have an abortion in their lifetime and of that 25% six out of ten are already mothers one of the main reasons people report wanting to have an abortion is that they can be a better parent to the kids they already have all of us have benefited from abortion whether it is that your mother was able to be a better parent to you whether it was that she had an abortion before you so that she could have healthy planned pregnancy later which was you find yourself saying well I don't know any women who have had an abortion the women around me don't do that yes they do they are just well aware of the fact that you are not a safe person to tell it is 25% of the women around you it is your mother's friends your sisters it is rich women poor women religious women women who are not religious women from all different cultures and backgrounds so as much as I hate your energy I'm glad that you have also benefited from abortion
