I think the permanence of internet has made people so afraid to be cringy that everyone is the fucking same myself include but like everyone on the internet is always policing everyone else that makes it so hard to deviate from the very narrow idea of the norm and like the thing is let's say someone makes a cringy video on the internet fine whatever but that's not the only consequence you have to worry about someone taking that video putting it on a different app having a bunch of people making fun of you going viral on the other app maybe it upsets people then people are messaging your job telling your school like literally trying to ruin your life because they disagreed with you about something that you said that is insane like it is insane that we society have gotten that place like everything has become so palatable and again I I know that I've done this myself like my (PUBLIC) politics in the last few years because my platform has grown have become so much more like milquetoast and I've stopped speaking radically because I'm always pissing people off it gets exhausting and it's like everyone has become the same we don't give people the space to like explore their different opinions or different thoughts like it was don't give people the space to be wrong I am a verbal processor so I come on this app and I just like I talk that like I the way that I think through things is by talking them out so yeah I I'm wrong often I will admit but like y'all make it so difficult to be wrong on the internet because the second you're wrong you get crucified
