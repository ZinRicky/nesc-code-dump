My husband called me from the office craving a pumpkin pie, so I got to work that afternoon. We're starting with a homemade crust, of course, using glyphosate free flour and pasteurized butter. After trimming the excess, I crimp the edges for a decorative look using my thumb. I throw this in the freezer and then get to making some homemade pumpkin puree by baking sugar pie pumpkins for 40 minutes until soft. I then puree the flash until it's soft, smooth and creamy. Then I pop the frozen crust into the oven for a 15 minute pre bake at 425 degrees every night. Filling comes together in no time in one medium sized bowl in pie spice, salt, coconut sugar, pumpkin puree, rock cream, pasture raised eggs and vanilla and stirred the filling and then we poured it into the pre baked pie shell. This baked for 35 minutes until set but still slightly jiggly and cooled overnight. We cut into it one evening later. It was perfectly pumpkin scrumptious with healthy ingredients.
