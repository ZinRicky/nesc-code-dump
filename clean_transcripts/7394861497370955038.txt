okay so you say you don't wanna vote for the Democratic Party in the fall because the Democratic Party has been aiding and abetting and presiding over a g-cide and so much discourse so much discourse there's been so much discourse um and discourse really only does so much um and even voting itself is 1% of 1% of all the things that we could be doing um and that's always my stance on voting as recently as 2022 I have said that I don't really care about voting cause you can't vote your way out of capitalism and fascism and all these things and I got dogpiled and suddenly now everyone is saying that they don't wanna vote and I'm the one who's out here saying I think we actually should vote this time um but anyway you don't wanna be complicit and g-cide well the thing is that um you're an American citizen and there's a very strong argument to be made that your sheer existence as an American citizen means that you are complicit in g-cide um because you reside on the patch of land that is rightfully that rightfully belongs to um indigenous people Native Americans and every president every American president ever could rightfully have the word g-cide put in front of their name because they have aided and embedded and presided over at least one g-cide and it's interesting that people are so against Joe Biden in particular um when he is like just as guilty as every American president before him and I'm not saying that we need to just be okay with g-cide obviously I'm just saying that when it comes to voting handing the victory to Donald Trump and therefore handing the victory to the rising right wing in this country is not going to do anything to combat g-cide and to combat your own complicity in g-cide and a month or two ago I would have been afraid to make this video and I think that's why I've mostly been lurking and not really posting when it comes to election discourse because it's been getting messy it's been getting messy and I do believe that a lot of this discourse has been fueled by people's privilege and moral superiority um and also just like a basic misunderstanding of what elections even are and what they mean
