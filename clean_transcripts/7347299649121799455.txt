I actually don't care if you don't like Dylan Mulvaney’s music a lot of people's criticism is just like transphobia but besides that there are people who are like “I’m an ally” and then tearing her a new one on TikTok she made a little song you didn't like do y'all get the amount of vitriolic hate the Dylan Mulvaney deals with online as someone who has been dogpiled several times on the internet just for existing that I would not wish on my worst enemy and that is fraction of the scale of Dylan Mulvaney deals with I don't care how valid your criticism of her final song is there is literally nothing in that song that could make me add on to the intense amount of hate that this woman already get the song is fun she literally just made the song fun and it is a fun song just let it be that what do you gain making fun of her for her music and everyone who's defending her is always like you know this is the worst song I've ever heard in my entire life literally horrible I would never ever wanna listen to this ever again but don't be mean to her it's like you don't you don't need to be doing all that either because we let CIS people make horrible music all the time and y'all don't make a disclaimer every time you talk about that if you don't like song okay great it wasn't for you but imagine sharing your fun little passion and both Democrats and Republicans come together in unison to hate on and then the people that are defending you oh yeah this is the worst song I've literally ever heard but be nice like controversial I like the song you guys are just weird
