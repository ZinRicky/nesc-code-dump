if you follow me and you know me I just know you're gonna roll your eyes at me when I tell you that we're starting a five day room renovation I know and it's okay even I'm rolling my eyes at me at this point and can I just say spoiler alert but expect to see a lot of the unhinged thumbs up during this so obviously it's a bedroom but whose bedroom is it I hear you wondering and why we got such a tight headline and why is that cupboard so fkn messy all valid questions I'm wondering the same quick backstory once upon a time when I was 20 my husband and I had a baby and that baby is about to turn 12 and his bedroom is easily the ugliest bedroom we have in our entire project house and this kid deserves the world so for his birthday he's getting a new room side note but never have I ever seen wallpaper come off this fkn easily it was an absolute blessing and we stripped the whole room in 15 minutes and cause we're doing this room on a budget well let's be honest we're doing the entire house on a budget but I'm gonna try and upcycle as many items from the old room as I can starting out with this lamp from Kmart which I've had for about five years I painted the lampshade Kohukohunui and then I went in with te Horo on the base and both of these colours are from Dulux then this little side table holds a special place in my heart because about 20 years ago it was my side table and aside from being a little bit old there's nothing actually wrong with it which is something I try and tell myself on the daily I don't know about you but generally I feel better about myself when I have a bit of foundation on and I feel like the same theory applies with the side tables so I'm gonna paint her Crow Valley also by Dulux and before the wood police come for me can I just say it's laminate so no trees were actually harmed in the making of this and while I worked on my silly little side quest my husband did actual proper jobs like putting panelling on the wall anyway that's everything I had to show for day 1 but it does get significantly more impressive so come back for the update
