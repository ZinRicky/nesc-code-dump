so for those of us breaking toxic family cycles have you heard the phrase I hope your kid is just like you now I didn't hear this my scapegoat older sister heard this her whole life and actually when I had my first born I had it said about my daughter because she my daughter was very similar and still is to my older sister like oh no she's just like Sarah using my sister as like the negative comparison and you know what I realized through all this it's actually really messed up I love my daughter and I realised my reactions to her behaviour were something I had to fix and I have re parented myself and I'm still in the process of re parenting myself and becoming a respectful gentle parent for her so all of that comparison only showed me that my parents weren't willing or able to do the work required for my sister and that was the failing of a parent not a kid
