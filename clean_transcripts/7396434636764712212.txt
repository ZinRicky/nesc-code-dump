I woke up this morning in my mother's bed which is a sentence I don't say very often but she's away for the weekend and being the opportunist that I am I selflessly volunteered to housesit it's our last day here on Waiheke Island and because I am my mother's daughter I started the day with some chores because this place will be spotless by the time I leave and I feel like you really know what your current favourite skincare products are when you're packing light for a quick weekend away I like to keep my skincare routine quite simple especially when I'm on holiday so I started with an oil cleanse followed by the Elizabeth Arden Prevage Eye Cream and I've been a big fan of the Prevage range for quite a long time but I've recently made the switch to the new Prevage 3 in 1 Reset Serum and the Multi-Restorative Soft Cream these are two new products from Elizabeth Arden and when used together theyâ€™re clinically proven to boost the collagen in your skin by 121% you can see the results within about a week and I've been using these two for almost a month and I must admit my skin is feeling tighter plumper and smoother at this point in the day I was absolutely desperate for a coffee so we mobilised the troops and headed on down to the local this place is right on the beach so it's a perfect excuse to take the family for a big walk and burn off some of that energy before heading back to the batch cleaning up packing up and sadly going home
