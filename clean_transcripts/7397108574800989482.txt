Home cooking is in freefall. It's been declining since the mid 60s as processed food has become more prominent and as fast food has. It's really taken over our diets in America. Rates of home cooking have fallen by half since the mid sixties. And then you have the industry with marketing messages that are implicitly telling us, you don't have time to cook, you're too important. A culture of home cooking was dismantled. And I decided that the best way to encourage people to cook was to remind them what a beautiful, miraculous work it is. Eat anything you want, just cook it yourself.
