taking my front step from dero to hero wasn't exactly on my bingo card this week But once I start something I struggle to stop and at this point of my life I've given up trying to fight the impulses and I just let them win it certainly keeps life interesting so I water blasted everything I could see Potted a new plant for the front step and things were starting to take shape but I knew we were far from done cause for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to paint my own front door mat and it was significantly harder than I anticipated but still heaps of fun It would have been a lot easier if I'd made a stencil but my printer decided it didn't wanna print and it didn't wanna print because I didn't wanna pay the subscription anymore so despite the fact that I own the printer and I own the ink apparently I have to pay a subscription every month just to use it and that type of capitalism really fks me off to be honest but that's the story for another day anyway you've really got a layer the paint onto this and I'm talking layers and layers I tried to free hand a font and then I did a border and I've added some flowers for a little bit of decoration when it dries I'll spray it with a sealer but while I was waiting I got distracted by shiny things or rather the lack thereof and I'm sure there are other people out there that suddenly find themselves in the middle of the most random task but I noticed that all of the door hardware was super dirty and aged looking so I took to it with some barkeepers friend and a scrub daddy and this combo always works wonders for me it was taking years of her life like honestly she was ageing backwards and by the time I was done they were quite shiny and I was feeling quite accomplished to be honest and like yes I probably could have gone out and just bought new hardware and maybe one day I will But I always say I don't mind if it's old so long as it's clean and I personally get immense satisfaction out of restoring something that's been in my home for a long long time hanging out with the door for so long was probably my downfall because it was really hard not to notice all of the chips in the paint and my toxic trait is that I gaslight myself into believing that a project is gonna be a lot quicker and easier than it normally turns out to be but it's that kinda delusion that gets shit done so I'm not mad at it side note but have you ever seen a woman sanding in her slippers cause it was the first for me and hopefully a last anyway I sanded through the grades on the door and the door frame and then I decided to paint cause why not I was actually amazed to see how yellow the original paint was compared to the new stark white that I was laying over and with any project like this it's really hard to know where to start and stop so I did the entire frame inside and out then it was time to turn my attention to the door and I actually really like the blue it just needs refreshing Thereâ€™s it's still a bit to do so come back for the reveal
