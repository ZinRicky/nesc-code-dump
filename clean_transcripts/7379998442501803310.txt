I get it but he's not the nicest now you're not exactly protecting them from him now you're having them live with him and spend every single day with him they never never never get a break from him and you're never gonna change the fact that he's their father he is their father you can't change that you can't take that away you can't erase it you have to just accept it and either force them to stay in a situation with somebody who is not the nicest all the time and show them how to take that show them how to get through life as an abuse victim show them how to get through life miserable and just dragging the weight of life with you everywhere you go or you show them how to take control of your life how to be happy and how to get safe and you show them that they matter enough to get safe cause kids totally understand like is anybody gonna do anything about this I know I'm not the only one who's teased what's going on here and then they look to you like why didn't you ever save me why did you keep us there what is going on so you either keep them around him 100% of the time or at least they get a break half of the time and also you get to be happy
