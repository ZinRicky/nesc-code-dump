I watched a video on being plus sized and hyper feminine and there was absolutely a trend between the two because for fat women or like fat feminine people your femininity is stripped away from you because fat people are already seen as over masculinized so (itâ€™s necessary) in order to kind of like just get on the same playing field as your thin counterparts just for like the bare minimum of human decency I would love to be able to go out you know play in face regular outfit you know not thinking about the way that I appear but there is a legitimate difference in the way that I get treated if I'm wearing my makeup if my chest is covered if I'm not always done up I can immediately tell the difference in the way that people treat me and it's hard to explain to someone who doesn't experience that but like literally when you are not doing this performance of femininity you literally get treated as less than human and even when you do everything right when you have the makeup when you have the jewelry when you have the outfit even then because you're fat you will be treated differently but like it's just it it's a survival tactic that's really what it is I'll go with my friends no like it's chill we're just going to get dinner and I'm like okay I still and we're just the exact same way that I would if we're probably going to a club or bar because I can't just go out in sweats I can't just you know go out in something casual because I will literally see the ways in which people treat me differently as a fat person being fat like my femininity is a performance it is something that I do for survival because I know that I get treated better when I look like this then if I'm wearing a T-shirt no makeup hair up and while that sucks I only have so much energy to deal with fatphobes during day so I do what I can to make my life easier
