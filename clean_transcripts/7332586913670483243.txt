Have you ever crave something you've never had before, but it sounds so good in your mind? That's what happened to me today, and that happens a lot now that I'm pregnant. So today I decided to act on it and make exactly what I was craving, which was papaya and lime whipped cream. So I started by zesting my lime and then adding some heavy cream to my mixer. And so I was craving something sour. I added a whole lime to my heavy cream and some powdered sugar. I got distracted at this point so I over whip my cream, but it was still fine. I added all of my lime zest into my cream and folded it in. Then I cut my very ripe papaya in half and deseeded it. There's nothing better than papaya and lime. So I added even more lime to my papaya before I blend in my whipped cream, just to give it a little bit more texture. I also added a sprinkle of coconut sugar on top and this was so delicious. It was actually exactly what I was craving. And now watching this video back, I actually need to go make them again.
