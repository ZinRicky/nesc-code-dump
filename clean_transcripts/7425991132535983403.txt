okay I just hopped off the treadmill because I had to respond to this because this is the conversation that needs to be had no mother who is sympathizing with the woman with the 17 diapers is saying that an environment with 17 dirty diapers is healthy for an infant no one saying that it should not be the standard however the conversation that is having and the conversation that is so much more important than how many dirty diapers were in her house is how we get to this point as women and mothers and caretakers how women have these babies are left to emotionally and physically drown until there are physical tells of how bad they're doing that's when people pay attention and instead of paying attention for it being a symptom of a larger problem um they only look at the symptom which could be dirty diapers which could be postpartum depression which could be a mental breakdown and then shame the mom for having those problems 17 dirty diapers is a symptom of a larger more dangerous problem with maternal mental health and that's why that should be the focus of the conversation that we're having not whether or not 17 diapers is disgusting cause it's bigger than that the conversation is bigger than that if we keep focusing on the 17 diapers or the mental breakdown or the woman who hasn't showered in three weeks we are gonna miss the opportunity to actually make change and actually help people and I agree the baby's other parent very important part of this conversation but that is not the only person who is supposed to make up the village for the new mother
