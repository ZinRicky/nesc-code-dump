I'm having my breakfast but I wanted to talk about something as a homeschool parent that I think really helped me make the switch from doing public school to doing um like private home education before starting this video I would like to acknowledge and admit that being able to homeschool your children is a privilege um and especially a financial privilege it is a privilege of time and resources that a lot of people do not have and public education is an absolute cornerstone to a free thinking society and I do not think public education should go anywhere what I do think however is that public education needs an update the system needs to be updated it hasn't been updated in decades and honestly our public education system could be so much better but we all know the powers that we don't wanna do that anyway back to homeschooling my older kids went to a Reggio Amelia program for preschool and pre K and my youngest who's two right now currently goes to a Reggio program and there is so much science behind child LED collaborative learning that breeds creative thinking it breeds problem solving it breeds collaboration and it instills a love of learning because it is so much more child centered than it is curriculum structured now if we're looking at the class economics of this these are always private programs and expensive there's a whole discussion to be had about why the best forms of learning are kept for the socioeconomical elite it's not hard to figure out so when I started thinking about homeschooling my older kids one of the biggest benefits I saw to it was having a much more child LED approach fostering their love of learning through allowing them to deep dive into things that they are interested in while still contributing to their education in the core required step subjects you know I'm not an unschooler per se we have curriculum that we use but I absolutely want my kids to be excited and engaged and passionate about all the different subjects that we're learning because in my opinion sitting through the motions going through your classes doesn't actually breathe learning at all how many of us stared off into space or zoned our teacher out because we were not engaged with the subject matter so when people say that homeschooling is a good option I agree I think homeschooling fills the gap that we have in our education system to allow for child LED and child engaged learning however I believe that that should be accessible for all children who would benefit from learning that way and I don't think it would be impossible for the American education system to adopt a Reggio Amelia or even a montessori type method of education but they won't because it leads to kids asking too many questions
