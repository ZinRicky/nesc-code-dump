things I've Learned over almost 10 years of parenting you have to be okay with your kid being upset in order to be a good parent you have to hold boundaries that your kids are not gonna like for example this morning me and my husband decided we're gonna take the whole family we're gonna go to Lowe's we're gonna pick out some seed packets we're gonna have a whole lesson about you know gardening and we're gonna get our Spring Garden started one kid had a massive tantrum it's not the kid you're gonna think it is we hold firm made them come they ended up having a great time different kid exactly the one you're gonna think it is ended up in a full blown meltdown because I won't let them run into traffic by themselves in both cases there were tears in both cases we persevered and held strong as the parents on our boundaries on what we're gonna do and how we're gonna do it the answer is sometimes to be an effective parent and a good parent you have to be okay with your kids crying or being upset but who had a good time me I thought that was awesome yeah I love who had a good time yes I rode to the front of the neighborhood they all had a great time
