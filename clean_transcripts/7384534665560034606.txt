do you think we are blind to currently that in five to 10 years we're gonna look back I think a lot of people have lash blindness I say this all the love in the world however I do notice them all and like when they're done well gorgeous amazing beautiful but I think a a lot of people because it's so expensive aren't going in for like refills quick enough so like there's that like sparseness that's evident when they fall and then I think because people have been wearing them for so long constantly they kind of don't realize how thick they are on their face and so you're getting a really full lash and because of that your eye starts like droop in like the corners you know what I mean like it just like it kind of pulling your eye down and finally I think that some people are getting lashes that are like too corse like I just like basically the lashes themselves are like thick does that make sense and I do think of you if you are gonna look back and be like oop literally zero judgment like if you like it I love it there like isn't a way for me to say this without being like well I don't wear lashes so I noticed it like without sounding like a pick me like I genuinely I promise I'm not I'm not coming from like that it's just like something I notice genuinely not trying to be mean
