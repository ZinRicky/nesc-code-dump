One thing about me is I will smile at complete strangers I dont care who you are  what you look  I will always smile at you I love to do it and I love to see when other people smile back More people need a smile I think we forget in our day to day life we're busy running errands we're busy going to the store whatever it may be We’re living our lives We’re forgetting to smile there's just something so pure and joyful about smiling I love to do it You don't have to smile at a stranger like I do you can just smile for yourself here's a friendly reminder just smile more It feels good 😁
