okay hot take imposter syndrome is not a self esteem issue it's a memory issue I think the way that we present it you know in terms of solving your imposter syndrome is like well you gotta change your how you see yourself and change your self conception and it's like feels impossible when really imposter syndrome is just that you've like forgotten how amazing you are instead of treating it like this like big transformational thing that you have to do that's gonna take so long that requires so many steps treat your imposter syndrome as if you had amnesia or like alzheimer's right you would have like post it notes to remind you of what things are I have post it notes in my closet that are like quotes from my friends like what how my friends perceive me so that when I'm in my amnesia episode and that I've forgotten who I am I can remember instead of like healing yourself so that you can get rid of your imposter syndrome get rid of your imposter syndrome so that you can heal
