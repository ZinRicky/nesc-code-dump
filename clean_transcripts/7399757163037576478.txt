Magically, everybody seems to understand a woman's choice when it comes to being a tribewife. And when she says, no, I totally wanna spend my whole life in service to this man and these children and have no identity of my own, oh, my god, it's her choice. It's her choice. It's her choice. Even though you're setting yourself up for complete fucking disaster and failure. Because human nature is gonna set in, something's gonna happen in the marriage, and you're gonna be fucked. In that case, we understand a woman's choice. But when it comes to her body and her choices, that's where we draw the line.
