let's do a style switch I was doing a little closet clean out and I found a couple pieces that I would never be able to incorporate into my everyday style right now because I have finally found my personal style and nobody would ever consider me edgy I pretty much now stick in my wheelhouse and have kind of a formula for getting ready so it was really fun for me to try and take on someone else's aesthetic style is always an evolution and these are pieces that I experimented with when I was trying to find my personal style although I don't think I ever wore all of these things at once I just elongated my winged eyeliner and I'm doing like a very glossy nude lip BT waves and gold jewelry I feel like this more than I thought I was going to I feel so powerful in this I like Taylor in her reputation era but this is why personal style is so important because this doesn't feel comfortable for me it just doesn't feel like me but I could dress up like her every now and then maybe just for the husband what do you think
