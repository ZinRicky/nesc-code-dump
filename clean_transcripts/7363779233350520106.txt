eat breakfast with me at church I'm Coptic Orthodox so this Sunday was Palm Sunday Next Sunday is Easter Orthodox calendar is different than American Christian and right now I'm showing you guys macarona bechamel this is basically an Egyptian lasagna it's penne pasta with a meat sauce and then a bechamel sauce on top but since in our religion you're supposed to fast until Easter meaning basically you're vegan till Easter this is I believe meat and dairy free Egyptians love to eat with a spoon for some reason so here's me struggling to eat this with a spoon this is by far my favorite Egyptian food next I'm washing it down with Egyptian apple soda delicious honestly the sodas in Egypt are so much better than the sodas in America 10 out of 10 next I'm gonna show you guys mahshi this is basically stuffed grape leaves typically it's stuffed with rice and um ground beef but because again we're fasting it's just rice and these are honestly very good for being vegetarian I guess vegan but to this day the best mahshi I ever had is my aunts she painstakingly rolls them all by hand by herself makes literally hundred passes out to family like she is phenomenal I'm wrapping up the leftovers to give to my family this mass went on so long (longer than usual, past 1pm!) it was 12:30 we've been there since 9:30 I was tired this is dessert it's basically Egyptian k√ºnefe I think there's another name but I can't remember and it's like shredded filo dough with cheese and then simple syrup honestly phenomenal to this day besides family the Egyptian church is the only place that I've had Egyptian food that's actually good otherwise in a restaurant just never hit the same as church or family I don't like filming myself in public so I was like looking around the entire time but yeah it was all delicious and thank you for sticking around and watching me have breakfast in church Happy Palm Sunday I love you guys so much okay
