This is the normal, like, phone stand that I use. And I just find something that I can set it on. It does track. I like this one. But this big mama is the one I just got, and I love it because it comes with a light, and the light attaches to it easily. You can put your phone in here. You can also attach the mic that comes with it. So instead of having to buy a tripod, you know, to hold your shit. And the light and the mic, it's just all in one. And then it does break down pretty small. I like it.
