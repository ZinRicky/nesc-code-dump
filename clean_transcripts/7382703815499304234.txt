why are we calling men dumb idiots I hear so many women in marriage call their man dumb clueless they don't know how to do things I don't get it Men are literally so smart in other ways compared to women women might be emotionally intelligent but oftentimes men are logically intelligent so it's very important to listen to them not belittle them especially if you're married or in a relationship why would you want to belittle your partner kind of feels like some women are out there on a I hate men campaign I understand a couple bad apples may have made them hate men but y'all just chuck those apples aside there's so many great men in the world
