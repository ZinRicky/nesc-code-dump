I'm no political consultant but if the only people that you can get to endorse your party are all white male over the age of 50 and like haven't been relevant since like the iPod came out maybe Taylor Swift isn't your problem like maybe it's your policies whenever the right creates a conspiracy theory you have to ask yourself what are they trying to distract you from point of conspiracies is always to foster denial or avoidance of uncomfortable truths in this case it's that one of the most influential powerful people in the world who has one of the biggest followings in the world is a Democrat so thinking hmm how can we be more relevant how can we cater to younger more diverse demographics yo she must be a Pentagon agent no there's a there's a reason if you actually paid attention to the reason you might come up with a better answer and have better people than 10 Nugent to represent your party
