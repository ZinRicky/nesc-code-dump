my first postpartum I had no idea what to expect I had everybody there in the hospital waiting everyone was super excited everyone was super around and honestly thank god it was my first pregnancy because I had an actually like pretty good time postpartum but I will never forget having a family member come over when I was like couple days postpartum maybe a week postpartum and asking me to like prepare dinner because they knew I had all these freezer meals because I had been so like paranoid and over prepared and prepared a ton of freezer meals to make sure that we would make it through postpartum easily and there's something to be said about that dynamic that a lot of daughters in law or daughters especially in specifically I'm just gonna talk about like white families um are not necessarily like nurtured by their family members like I see other people post videos about their abuela or their Korean mother in law and they are cleaning they're cooking they're taking care of their children they're in laws their grandchildren but when I had my first baby postpartum I just didn't necessarily feel that way and I just knew with my second I wanted to be alone to just do whatever I needed to do heal be hormonal cry not take care of anybody else and thank god I had my in laws to help watch after my oldest and they were super respectful about everything because I needed that space that time I had panic attacks I postpartum anxiety it was not a great it was not a good experience at all so with my third we were also very private because sometimes you can't prepare even for like the best case scenario because after dealing with postpartum anxiety and panic attacks and um just an absolutely horrific mental experience with my second I I don't think I would be okay with the pressure of like having to perform or having to play some sort of role while dealing with that so I just know that when my kids have kids if they have kids I just wanna support them in a way that they will feel supported and loved and that it'll be okay if they need to just take care of themselves and their baby
