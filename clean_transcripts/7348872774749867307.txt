People don't actually understand that you don't need a boyfriend or friend to do the things you've always wanted to do stop, stop, stop waiting on another person Want to try a new cafe but everyone's always busy? go alone! Wanna try a new pottery class but none of your friends are interested? go alone! we have to stop waiting for other people to share the same interests as us, we have to just start doing them start doing them now stop waiting for other people we simply just need to stop wasting our opportunities because other people aren't available to us we need to live our lives for us and start doing the things that truly make us happy even if it's alone you can have fun on your own I promise you that so stop waiting and start doing the things that really make you happy I often go out to eat by myself people might think it's weird but I don't care if I want something I'll go eat alone simply I'm just tired of waiting for other people to be available when my schedule is more flexible and I wanna experience life I have to do things on my own and so do you if you wanna live your life to the fullest you really have to put yourself first instead of other people so stop waiting and start saying yes to yourself that is what life is all about okay start saying yes to yourself
