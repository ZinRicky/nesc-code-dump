so I just found out that Liam Payne died um and it's a really complicated feeling right now growing up I was a really big fan of one direction really important part of my childhood that being said I have been caught up with all of the things that have been coming out about him in the last few weeks um so I just wanted to say before this becomes crazy have your feelings have your feelings about Liam you can have your feelings about you know being a fan of his you know him being one direction I understand he was a really big part of a lot of people's childhoods that being said leave Maya Henry alone leave the woman that have spoken about him alone other right now this is what Maya Henry's comment section looks like I genuinely could not imagine what that woman is going through right now um absolutely unacceptable like it's really unfortunate to be watching this happen in real time because like regardless of your feelings about him like this is a tactic of abuse like things were coming out about him I'm sure more things are gonna come out about him and to escape responsibility like and this also guarantees that his victims will have to be even in his death perpetually victimized by him and his actions and his stans and his fans so you can have your feelings but don't perpetuate the same abuse to his victims that he did separate your feelings as a fan from their feelings as victims of abuse I don't know just leave those women alone
