Love shouldn't cost you anything you shouldn't have to qualify for the girl that you actually want by the number you have in your bank account the only thing that you should have to qualify for the girl that you actually want is the man that you are your a good character being trustworthy loyal and ambitious It should never be about the amount you have in your bank account and whether or not you have nice things if a woman doesn't want you when you're not at your peak when you're still grinding to reach your goals or reach that promotion or reach the job that you actually want She doesn't deserve you at your peak honestly why would you want her in your life if she's not willing to love you at your lowest she doesn't deserve you If she considers you an unqualifying man by the amount you have in your bank account then she's not qualified to love you properly she's not qualified to be in your life period honestly real love doesn't cost a darn thing so pay attention and find the right one that will love you properly not love you for your money
