this room has been the bane of my existence for longer than I care to admit we're finally getting somewhere and today I'm styling this is the inspo we're going for dark and moody textured, dramatic, pops of brass and I'm really hoping I can put something together that feels paired back elegant, mature sophisticated, you know all the things that I'm not so I did my research put together a bit of a moodboard and then me and my tape measure took off to Freedom to see what we could find these shelves are a bit difficult because no two measurements are the same and I'm talking height and depth but the team at Freedom was super helpful at helping me find pieces that might fit the brief and now is the perfect time to go visit because absolutely everything is on sale until the end of the month and finally it's time for the fun part to see whether or not my vision is actually gonna come to life I've tried to mix textures colours sizes and groupings and for me I'm the sort of person who really doesn't like it when things feel cluttered so I've tried to give everything adequate breathing room so that each piece can kind of speak for itself and my ethos in this room is to use a mixture of old and new some of these new pieces from freedom some I already had and some things like this painting have been in my family for longer than I have and I like the idea of my children gazing at the same piece that I looked at when I was a kid I finished it off with a moody pot, an olive tree and an ottoman which I've had my eye on for almost a full year and this room has so many little spaces so many different facets to style and I am very far from done but so far this is how we're shaping up and after almost tearing my hair out over this room and painting it six different colours I feel like finally we're getting somewhere I feel like the palette is coming together the textures are working it's starting to feel cohesive I still have a lot to do but as of right now this is a room I'm really enjoying spending time in
