do you understand what straight size midsize and plus size mean cause it come to my attention that not everyone is actually aware of what those categories represent midsize as a term should only be used to describe people between straight sizes and plus sizes right that sizing is typically the X L to the one X these are the people that are literally in the middle of a straight size and a plus size I realize that not everyone understands the actual difference between straight size and plus size they are literally like different base forms and cuts of the way that clothing is made like you can't just take a size small and add a couple inches to create like you know a 3 4 5 x so in order to like account for like the different shape that plus size bodies typically have it is actually literally created in a different way here's some visual to go up from this size small you would do what is called grading up the pattern which is typically just adding a certain amount of inches between each size however that is not something that you can do to go from straight size to plus size so this is what happens when you try and grade up a size small to like a one X that doesn't really work so that's why you're grading up to an XL or like an X XL not a 1 x you can see right now the the plus size is longer and there's more space in the bust because of this dart right here like literally the way that these clothing items are cut are going to be different right so this is what happens if you grade up a small to a 1X versus just having the one X right like they're literally formed differently so straight sizes typically talk about small medium large right you can do extended sizes which are like an extra large extra extra large extra extra large you know what I mean but like those extended sizes are not plus sizes and I think that's where people get confused the extended sizes are still using that original straight size form and they're just adding inches and they're just grading it up right but a 1 x 2 x 3 x whatever all of that that is plus sizes so clothing has two different forms straight size and plus size right now where the term mid size can come into account is when you're talking about those people that land right in the middle they are not always straight size and they're not always plus size they are typically extended sizes and you know beginning of plus sizes that's my belief the term mid size in general is a little bit complicated because I do think often people use the term mid size to separate themselves from the identity of being plus size that's not the point of this video the point of this video is if you are going to use the term mid size I personally think that the only time you should be using it is if you are someone that exists in that mid size between the straight and the plus sizes cause I keep seeing people who are literally a size medium calling themselves midsize that is not what that word mean a medium is in the middle of straight sizes a medium is a straight size item of clothing right so yeah I think that the only people that can be calling themselves midsize are the people that wear between the XL and the one X but if you typically are just always gonna wear consistently an XL I think you're still straight sized and if you're consistently always wearing a 1 x I think you're a plus size but if you wear both and you would like to use the term midsize that's completely up to you hope this helped
