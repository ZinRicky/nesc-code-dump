good afternoon I am way late in posting this because I have spent the most of my morning trying to convince my husband we need to scratch our dream home plans and buy some acreage in a mobile the reality is that plan will cost us about $5,000 a month for a two bedroom mobile home so probably not gonna happen but a girl can dream right truth is I'm just getting really impatient and wanna be back on our family compound and that is a quick and easier solution but there is just no way in heck that man is gonna go for it
