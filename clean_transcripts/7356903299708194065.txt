Men used to be slutty. Look at that. That's two whores right there. Where's that energy? Now look at that little hoe with a bird in his hand. Come on. When did men stop dressing like this? When society collapsed. And if you're a man, you're like, why aren't women attracted to me? Have you considered being a slut? DIY all your shirts into crop tops. Just trust me, I'm sick of this lazy male fashion.
