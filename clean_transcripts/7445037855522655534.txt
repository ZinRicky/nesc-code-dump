What I eat in a day as a mom who eats an ancestral diet and as someone who avoids seed oils, artificial sugars, dyes, and preservatives at all costs. I start my morning off with a coffee using organic beans to caffeinate with the chemical free Swiss water process and then have a small bowl of probiotic cottage cheese with passion fruit from my vine. At 8:00am I get to making sourdough pizza using my sourdough, freshly milled whole grain flour, salt and water. While that rests, I make myself two fried eggs for my pasture raised chickens out back. My chickens get an organic corn free, soy free grain mix. At two PM I prepare the batter for a loaf of chocolate chip pumpkin bread using 24 hour fermented buckwheat and iron corn flour. While this bakes for one hour, I make some pate using pasture raised chicken livers from a nearby farm along with garlic, butter, Rosemary for my bush, raw cream and salt. This pate is absolutely delicious and incredibly nutritious for everybody from babies to adult. I save and reuse all my glass jars and free small servings of pate for a later day. The pumpkin bread comes out of the oven just as I get back in the house from picking the kids up from school, and shortly thereafter I shape the pizzas allowing them to do their final rise before dinner. At five thirty PM I prepare the pizzas by carefully placing the dough Onto a hot pizza stove pairing with pasture raised raw cheese and all beef pepperonis, then baking for 7 minutes on the outside grill until sizzling. Salad is quick and simple with an olive oil and vinegar dressing. I transferred the hot pizza to a wooden board and slice it using a pizza cutter. This is the best pizza in the world, hands down. For dessert we enjoyed a piece of chocolate chip pumpkin bread with butter.
