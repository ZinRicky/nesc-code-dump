Four weeks straight, my toddlers have been asking me for chicken nuggets and fries. They usually don't request a lot, so I decided to make them exactly that today. I started by grinding up my chicken and then seasoning it with onion and garlic powder, paprika and salt. I formed them into little nugget shapes and put them on a Parchment paper lined baking tray before popping them in the freezer for about 30 minutes. In the meantime, I washed my potatoes and sliced them up into matchsticks. Repeated that with all of my potatoes before placing them into ice cold water and let that sit while I made my ketchup. I combined some tomato paste, honey, vinegar, water, salt and let that simmer until thickened before letting it cool. Dried off all of my potatoes as best as I could before seasoning them up and putting them on a baking tray roast in the oven. I left them in there for about 30 to 40 minutes and when they were almost done, I started on the batter for my chicken nuggets. I mix some cornstarch, flour, seasoning and some sparkling water my chicken nuggets and some cornstarch and then in my batter before frying them up until they were golden brown on both sides. I then placed them on a wire rack and it was time to plate. Plate it up. My chicken nuggets first, then my fries and some of that homemade ketchup and my kids were so Excited to have this
