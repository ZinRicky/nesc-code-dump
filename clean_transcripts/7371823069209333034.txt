are you ever at work or doing like a class project and you realize that it would just be easier for you to do it all yourself than explain how to do it to somebody else because that's what it's like being the default parent and house manager even a well meaning partner who's sitting there being like well just tell me what to do doesn't realize that that's a task in and of itself one you may not have time for that adds to the workload and a partner who uses weaponized incompetence will use that as an excuse to not participate whereas a partner who actually wants to participate equally in domestic labor will take the initiative to learn how it's done by observation or by learning on the job you don't know where the kids laundry go open up all the drawers I'm sure you'll figure it out don't know how to do your daughter's hair trust me she'll let you know if it hurts women who are burnt out don't have time to be teaching and frankly putting the honest on her to teach you how to do things it's just putting another thing on her plate
