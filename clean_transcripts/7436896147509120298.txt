okay so you know how they always do like a before and after of the presidents at like at the beginning of their term and at the end because they've always aged a lot and like look so different because the job is just worn them down I feel like I need to make sure to be doing a before and after of me for the next four years of this administration because we it hasn't even started and I've aged significantly in the last week this headline alone has aged me this is what you guys are gonna see in four years I'm gonna be like they used to do press conferences at the White House and not just with Fox News they would do them with all of the different news channels even the ones that were a bit hard on them used to have federal agencies there used to be a department of education you used to not be able to profit off the presidency you know Jimmy Carter even sold his peanut farm anyways I hate it here it's been the longest week of my life
