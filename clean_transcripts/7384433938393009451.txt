so many men were confused when I talked about the bear versus man argument the fact that I have a husband and I'll do you one better I also have two sons so three males in my household in my family that I love and when women who talk about feminist ideas or talk about dismantling the patriarchy um reference the fact that they have male partners men get super pissed because how dare we have critiques of toxic masculinity or patriarchal system if we obviously love men and here's how you do it um the patriarchy hurts men just as much as it hurts women in different ways by far but these men who are angry at feminists are the same men who will go talk about the male unaliving rate or violence against men or the fact that they have to be drafted into military service all of those my dude all of those systems outcomes of a patriarchal society and I don't know about you but I want better for my sons the conversation that they are not ready to participate in because they can't understand the nuance behind it is that a lot of feminists a lot of people men included who want to dismantle the patriarchy are doing so because they do love and want better for men now I'm gonna use the same line y'all use on us all the time not all men cause some of y'all are beyond repair and are not fit for more progressive society but you can probably spot those ones out those are the like the red pill toxic male like the type of men who call other men who are in happy relationships with their wives simps those guys they're not coming with because those men genuinely think that women are their problem and the problem is never been women as a collective it's been men as a collective as a system of oppression so I simply just want better for all of us and that includes the men that I love who are worthy of a better version of this world
