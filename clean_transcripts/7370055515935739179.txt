My eczema has been flaring up so bad postpartum all over my hands, on my face, and if something is wrong with my gut, that usually reflects on my skin, so I tend to flare up. I love how taking seed just supports my gut health and fixes things. I take the DSO1 Daily Synbiotic. It's a 24 strain probiotic blend which I've tried a bunch of different probiotics and I always come back to see since it's the most effective. And I see an improvement in my skin when my gut gets healed. So if anyone is struggling with eczema or other skin problems or even just floating, it would be worth it looking into your gut health and it and trying out a probiotic. Mmm.
