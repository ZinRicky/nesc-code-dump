it's been a long day I did the school run tidied the house walked the dog did some work got ready went to an event picked the kids up went to two after school activities and now I need to cook dinner and I thought maybe just to make life that much more exciting I'm gonna see if I can do this in 20 minutes and I don't know if this is cheating but in the interest of full disclosure I deliberately bought pre prepared ingredients from Woolworths to try and make this dinner faster started by putting on some rice because my plan is to make my take on teriyaki chicken on rice and spoiler alert but this is gonna come back and bite me in the ass very soon then I very quickly sliced some onion capsicum and courgette in a hot wok I used two portions of Woolworths diced chicken breast so I didn't have to waste any time chopping normally once my chicken was cooked I'd set it aside in a separate bowl and just cook my veggies in the same wok but I quickly realised that wasn't gonna work for me today cause we're racing against the clock so I've got two frying pans on the go In goes my sauce I used two sachets of the new Woolworths teriyaki sauce and I found this in the chiller right by the stir fried veggies and with 2 minutes 15 seconds to spare my stir fry was done my rice however.. was not I thought maybe if I stared at it it might cook faster and for some strange reason that didn't help at all so I added an extra five minutes to my timer five minutes came we went and there was still no sign of rice so I added another 5 minutes to my timer cause I thought what the heck may as well follow this thing through My rice cooker has been on her last legs for about a year now and I keep meaning to upgrade it but then I forget anyway we're down to the wire and have about 5 seconds to plate if I had bought the microwave rice from Woolworths I would have easily smashed this challenge but rushing around the kitchen was actually super fun I felt like I was on Masterchef anyway that's how I make my 20 minute stir fry And my 30 minute rice
