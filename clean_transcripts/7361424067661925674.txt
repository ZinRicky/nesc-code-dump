Does anybody else think about this you think you have so many problems until you have a health problem this is literally my Roman Empire I think about this at least once a day If you wake up every day healthy then every other little problem you think you might have seems so minuscule it seems so small You need to change your mindset Have a mindset that you don't have problems you just have things to do life really is just is made up of things that you have to do You donâ€™t have problems If you're healthy you don't have problems
