what the Supreme Court did yesterday will impact each and every one of our lives and it's yet another blow to reproductive rights and gender Equality let me explain there's a legal doctrine called Chevron deference that dates back to 1984 see Congress often passes vague laws and leaves it up to the experts at federal agencies to fill in the gaps so for example the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act instructs that only safe medication should be on the market but it's up to the FDA to actually make that a practical reality the past 40 years, Chevron deference has told courts look you have to defer to a federal agency's interpretation of a law because they are literally experts and you're not you have no subject matter expertise in what is typically highly specialized complex areas like healthcare transportation education artificial intelligence all of these areas where we should be deferring to the experts in these fields not unelected judges who again have no subject matter expertise and mind you this isn't like a completely unchecked power here courts can step in if they find that an agency's interpretation of a law was unreasonable but yesterday after 40 years of deferring to federal agencies the Supreme Court put an end to Chevron deference giving courts and themselves the green light to second guess any agency actions that it doesn't like this is a huge win for corporations Trump and Project 2025 which specifically calls for the “deconstruction of the administrative state” because who wants silly scientists doctors and other experts getting in the way of a good time consider the mifipristone case this term where a group of anti choice doctors asked the court to take mifepristone a widely used abortion medication off the market claiming that it's not safe and that the FDA screwed up when it approved the drug nearly 30 years ago even though mifepristone is safer than Tylenol penicillin and Viagra the court dismissed the case for a procedural issue but left the door open for a new case to fix the procedural issue and make the same argument again which will now be a lot stronger given that these anti choice judges don't have to give any deference to the FDA so whether or not mifepristone is safe enough to be on the market will be a question for Sam Alito and Clarence Thomas not the experts and scientists and doctors at the FDA because of course. conservatives will capitalize on yesterday's ruling to try to eradicate abortion access throughout the country to curb access to birth control and attack other really important protections like the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act which requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to pregnant employees as well as the Pump Act which requires employers to allow employees to pump at work they'll go after protections for trans kids and schools and they're gonna go after efforts to curb climate change and so much more this decision is going to impact each and every one of our daily lives so it's critical that everyone understands I'm the feminist lawyer please comment your questions or let me know anything I can do to help
