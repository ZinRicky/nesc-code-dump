so I got vox popped and it's gone viral I'll tag Connor below but there are threads talking about whether me and my boyfriend are arguing in the vox pop and talking about whether or not he's a Trump supporter it's so funny to me so we're having this exchange and um he asked me do you wanna go first and I just launch into absolutely as a woman men should shut the hell up about it and he just steps aside and the camera just pans towards me it comes across really harsh and intense but people are getting their knickers in and on about it so I just wanna set the record straight on this interaction is my boyfriend a Trump supporter hell no he said as a woman you should go first you should speak on this he said that in order to make a point he didn't let his ego get in the way of making a feminist point we both knew that it was for the camera and we both knew it was theatre and we both know that a lot of the time politics is theatre so this was all to make that point we know each other so well he knew what I would do I knew what he would do neither of us is upset or offended and we've been cackling about it people are saying oh they've argued about this like her boyfriend must be a Trump supporter um you know you can just tell they had an argument about it um we've had discussions about it and we're both completely on the same page he is a complete socialist so he doesn't really like most people in politics but in terms of Trump he knew that as someone with a uterus um my views were a little more poignant and a little more relevant in this particular case and he didn't need to be asked twice he stepped right aside and I wouldn't expect anything less of a man of a man I choose to be with he knows that in the moment my anger at saying shut up was directed towards Trump and towards the men on the internet has been saying horrific things on behalf of survivors and on behalf of women and trans people everywhere he knew my ankle was directed at that situation and not at him he's disgusted that Trump was elected he's disgusted by what's been happening on the internet and he wholeheartedly supports everything that I said
