it's about dang time we finally get to make this coffee I made breakfast with my kids and just an entire bag of oranges at this point in the morning now my kids are just chatting away about scrub daddies because we saw the Halloween scrub daddies on TikTok Shop and they're obsessed we had a full 30 minute conversation about the different shapes of scrub daddies so they should have for different seasons and different events that happened like why we didn't have shark scrub daddies for Shark Week I don't even know if those exist but scrub daddy if you're listening we need Shark Scrub Daddy you're probably wondering how we got down this rabbit trail well my kids love the different coloured scrub daddies and it has encouraged them to clean so I'm 100% gonna be buying them in every colour just so they'll clean their own bathroom because I am pretty sure those kids get toothpaste everywhere except their toothbrush
