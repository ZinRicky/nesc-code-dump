added layer to the discussion about dads being participatory parents as is the expectation and bare minimum is the reality that connection comes from care birthing parents get a leg up with having that connection already because they are caring for a growing fetus inside their body well before it enters the world just ask any pregnant person about their anxieties but something I think a lot of like absentee parents and absentee family members don't quite understand is that the connection or relationship you're gonna have to a child comes from the amount of care you provide for them so although some of these care tasks may not be your favourite changing diapers doing feeds waking up in the middle of the night those are the things that foster the relationship and the connection you don't get one without the other which is why I believe that the idea that mothers are simply connected and closer to their children comes down to the fact that they are usually the main caretaker and fostering that connection with a secondary partner or dad is so beneficial and important and special but it starts and ends with caretaking
