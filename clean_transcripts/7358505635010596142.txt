it's that we are remembering we matter as well it's not all about one person in the marriage that's why the trad wife life is failing that's why women are picking divorce picking single motherhood we're not getting left we're doing the leaving we are realising that we fucking matter do you see what's happening in South Korea with the 4B movement you are not entitled to our bodies to our abilities to our skills if we know how to cook that doesn't mean we need to be cooking your fucking meals just because I know how to do laundry doesn't mean I need to be folding yours the younger generations are waking up and realising and the older generations like me are cheering them on and giving them the honest fucking truth that we didn't get the trad life life sucks traditional gender roles being the good little girl that does everything right and stays at home gives unmedicated birth and bakes all the bread from scratch still gets fucked so it's not worth it don't ever give up your autonomy don't ever give up your voice and don't ever fucking lose yourself from my mother and generations before her had no options they had no rights they couldn't work they couldn't get bank accounts so all those beautiful little love stories that lasted for 65 years is basically a story of a prisoner and her warden and she was stuck and trapped had no other option she literally could not find housing because her father probably would not wanna support her anymore if she left her husband because it's now her husband's responsibility and if she's leaving him what if he's not hitting you what's so wrong so ever since women have been given rights as we get rights we immediately take them use them and empower ourselves and now is when men don't like it so they're trying to roll back our rights and they're starting with our body body autonomy by taking away abortion rights and now that we're not trapped you have to actually fucking show up and be a man huh it's your fault you're fucking depressed go work on yourself it's not your fucking wife's problem and if you're with a man like this wake the fuck up
