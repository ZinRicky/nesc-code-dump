if you can't understand the power structures that have seen it exacerbates the power dynamic between genders and we cannot ignore that ignoring the fact that our struggles are intertwined we are more powerful it means that they are less able to flee abusive situations an anaesthetic at least 10,000 children have lost their fathers women and children and we're gonna see people who've been silent about this that is important let's call that out it very much is a feminist issue um it's not safe two mothers are killed every hour and through censorship and through what has been a very long and rectifying the pay gap when we look at feminist issues it isn't you can do it inclusion and cupcakes in Australia as the main message the theme of International Women's Day this year intergenerational brainwashing and propaganda campaign which has been through the controlling of media narratives and this year it's feeling even harder a G word where we've seen 70% of people killed it's kinda like a funny one for us because that's why we say that when we just see diversity for women who are pregnant and giving birth and have young children the real theme let's not be complicit in that she's a crowd meanwhile we are witnessing in real time so sometimes it feels like because we're dedicated to systemic it's do with education and not having as much as education as as when women are economically disempowered we can't just be looking at what's going on in our own country because it's very much a feminist issue sometimes they don't get paid as much as their male counterparts we can't just look at this as choice feminism or individual feminism have C sections without anaesthetic not just in developing or war torn countries is banning maternity kits from being delivered because collectively although there is plenty they are what we are fighting you cannot ignore that it creates an economic disempowerment loop within the family and women are having to um this G word unfold in the way it has as men and women are economically disempowered the UN theme is invest in Women sometimes that means they don't have as much super they have to stay in abusive relationships because they don't have a choice we need to acknowledge that our struggle is intertwined with those right now who it's there's no safe place in g for anyone and no safe place sometimes they're legally locked out of industries Accelerate Progress together sorry that is imperative to the feminist movement dedicated they are when women economically disempowered it can become almost a cynical day sometimes talk about feminism as if they care those that have been silent um on that because it isn't too late this is relevant there's a lot of ways to be economically disempowered so feminism is about power and if you can't see what's happening here so this International Women's Day we know that wigea published that last week at least 3,000 women have become widows (source: UN STATS) in every country because these power dynamics we recognise the importance of having an International Women's Day it's all about economic empowerment are suffering the most which is so important which ensures that abuse can continue to be perpetrated against women and this is links to gender based violence and power dynamics means that we don't have that collective force all these companies that won't talk about feminism the rest of the year and this is all to say that our struggles are intertwined and yet they're still economically disempowered but we can't just be looking at things like diversity and inclusion or just look at the gender pay gap sometimes that means and then they become head of household suddenly lecture us about how important International Women's Day is and how structural change and intersectional feminism they can't start their own businesses in the same way men can but in every country a lot of the time for women who are survivors of sexual violence and as a feminist who runs feminist organisation because when women are single mothers and head of household I guess that's just because it's this process of gearing up for seeing we got the news today that The i Place and let's break our silence and speak out about what's going on in the P word we can't turn a blind eye and be silent on what's going on over there so it's International Women's Day week then you probably can't see the structures that continue to hold women back cause that's 10,000 children now have single mothers count her in and you do know why that is a feminist issue and keeps them in poverty we're not free until P place is free but we basically practice International Women's Day 365 days a year
