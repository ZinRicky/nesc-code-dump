on my last video about marriage I had a friend say that marriage is supposed to be your safe place and I've never thought about it in those terms before but she was exactly correct there are so many awful things in this life that you were gonna go through there are so many moments when you were gonna be self conscious when you were gonna feel low when you were gonna need propping up and you undoubtedly are gonna go through some hard stuff and marriage can be this beautiful gift that you give yourself it is supposed to be the person that you can come to with all of your ails your worries your woes, your insecurities and work through them and be supported and loved and that's not to say that you can't get that in other relationships but the added element of that lifelong commitment that lifelong promise to each other to show up till death do you part allows some of that reassurance that even if you are your worst self sometimes they're gonna help you get through it now I understand that that is not everybody's reality and divorce exists in astronomical numbers for a very good reason but there is that like glimmer of hope and optimism when it comes to marriage that doesn't exist in other relationships I have Learned so much about myself and so much about the good in the world through being married marriage should feel like a warm blanket like coming home and if it doesn't don't do it because it's still legally binding
