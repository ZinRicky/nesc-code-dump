like painting and trying to make this house everybody has a shit drawer like cleaning and organising today but itâ€™s gotta be done ignored it ever since but just so you know not look awful and of course qualified to lead our planet you can judge me but most likely decluttering and organising all of the main areas of my house we moved into this house seven months ago got carried away and we hit the ground running and it's fine anyway I'm hot was to let you know that I didn't really feel Now you know my dirty little secret and you kinda don't know where everything lives just yet three kids all up in my grill 24/7 it's really hot but remember I've done it again but I've also been keeping this cupboard from me and I just wasn't very high on the list of things to do I have a shit cupboard cause if you follow me I dedicated January to cleaning when you're getting to know a house my nickname when I was younger was actually Jabber Jaws little masterpieces like this one here in Aotearoa New Zealand I'm talking to you ðŸ‘€ it's bled through to February and you know fill you in on the context may actually be repairing itself but I heard today on a TikTok that the ozone especially in older home where storage is an issue so we basically just raw dogging the sun down here I just kind of put their colouring and shit in this cupboard it's been a long couple of months with I'm already judging me enough for the both of us yeah so I think it was like the day or the day after we moved in it's cause my kids insist on making messy that would be great you know I've been busy doing other stuff but the point of all of that intro it's almost the end of the school holidays distracted with renovation side quests so if we could all just chill out until then would you believe it yes world leaders because I just pretend it doesn't exist I've been keeping this cupboard from you yeah I'm restocking my first aid kit and no and full transparency it's not a coincidence anyway like so hot and it could be cause I keep getting speaking of people who don't seem remotely but maybe don't look at our temperatures I'm gonna cut straight to the point and we don't have an ozone cause they don't actually sound that impressive thanks for coming to my ted talk that's enough for today
