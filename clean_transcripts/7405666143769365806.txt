you guys wanted to see some of the jewelry that I've been making as a very amateur brand new at jewelry making person who just this is my new hyperfixation craft so I finally got it all organized and I wanna show you some of the stuff I've made okay so I have made this like pastel set these are three separate necklaces but I will wear them all together um but I've made that which I really love I think I'm gonna make couple more in this color story I've noticed that when I make something I make it almost like a like a tiny mini collection um this is all stuff I just recently made I'm going to start going into more fall colors to match some of my more fall outfits but like look how cute the like roses are on the beads I love these I made a bunch of blue and white stuff to wear with my outfits in Italy because I wore yellow blue and red as my colors pretty much for what I packed so I wore this one with the Vatican outfit that I had on and like I just love these classic pearl look this is the first charm necklace I know charm necklaces are really really big right now but I'm not huge into the charm necklaces but this one's really cute you can't really see it until I put it on and then this is a double strand pearl necklace this was one of the first ones I made and still might be I'll show you still might be my favorite because it has like the baroque like raw pearls as well as well as like the bead ones um and here I have some of like the red stuff that I made this I think is my favorite it was just like this little charm that I added pearls to and then put it on this like thicker chain necklace it's very like it's very like cheekily you know Borgia esque I kind of love it now my issue is going to be storage um I don't plan on selling these or I'm gonna have to start giving stuff away because I'm starting to have more than I like really need or have room for um so yeah I'm gonna have to give some stuff away I think because I like making them but I can't keep everything the next stuff I have I already have the supplies where I'm gonna do like a whole Disney themed stuff I found some cute charms at Michaels um and we have a Disney trip coming up soon and I'm a huge Disney fan so gonna make some Disney jewelry that I can wear in the parks and I'll show you those next
