Men are travelling out of the U.S. just to find a wife. I was watching a podcast the other day, and it went on to explain why men are travelling out of the States to find a wife To sum it all up, they say that women from other countries are well educated, classy, elegant, very feminine, and they understand how to give and take in relationships. instead of being demanding, entitled, and ungrateful for things that men do for them. I'm not saying all, but some women in America have grown so entitled and demanding basically they think that they can treat a man however they want and they can get away with it They treat a man poorly and then they criticize their looks when they're not in the best shape themselves. So agree or disagree all you want, but men do like feminine women, they like when women behave feminine, and they like when women take care of themselves. we want a good man, but they're tired of our b.s. So much in fact, that they're travelling overseas just to find a wife that respects them.
