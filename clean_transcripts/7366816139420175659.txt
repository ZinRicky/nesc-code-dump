Let's make homemade yogurt together. So I like to use raw milk, but you can also use pasteurized. I'm heating a half a gallon of milk up to 188 degrees. Then I pour it off and let it cool to 115. Then I'm gonna whisk in two tablespoons of yogurt I saved from the last batch, getting it all incorporated, and then I just cover it with Saran wrap, and I put it in my warmer, which is just a cabinet with a thermostat and heat lamp. This is at 115 degrees all night long, 12 to 24 hours, until the next morning when it's done. My yogurt turns out really wet. There's a lot of extra way so you can drain that off by straining it with cheesecloth, but I just leave it wet, and I stir in oats for my husband's breakfast muesli. Thanks for joining me. Enjoy.
