T G I F this week has been so fun and productive but also so exhausted does anyone else feel this way but before we head into the weekend let's talk about science curriculum this is our second year using the Sassafpress Science Adventure by Elemental Science it's a literature based curriculum with the main text being a novel the novel is about the sassafpress twins and their crazy Uncle Seys they go on all these crazy adventures and learn about science so every week we read a chapter go on a new adventure and learn about the human body the curriculum comes with an activity guide it's kinda like a teacher's manual that helps you go deep and decide at logbook where you can log all of the information that you're learning they also have a downloadable lap book option on their website which is what I do the lap book is just definitely easier for little kids so I print out the materials we need for each chapter and then we glue it into our science at this point you already know how much I love Learning Journal it's just a really fun and easy way to introduce your littles to science but pro tip download the audiobook you'll thank me later
