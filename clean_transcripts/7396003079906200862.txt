you do not have to give birth to biological children in order to have value and if anyone's unclear about that we should just ask any president we've ever had right we don't question um the contribution of men in our society because they don't give birth and so we shouldn't be doing that for women American women come in all shapes and sizes they come from all kinds of different family configurations so for duty Vance to denigrate an entire group of women based on an arbitrary skill that he doesn't even have is really embarrassing and it's not embarrassing for women it's embarrassing for him well
