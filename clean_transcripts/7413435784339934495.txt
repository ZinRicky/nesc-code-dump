This really is the best tumbler in my opinion, because I love that you can change out the handle. And then I just love that your kid can be drinking from the straw part or the open mouth part. I love it. So do my kids. And since it's not the big name brand that everybody else has, it's easy to spot. It's easy to recognize which one is your kids cup. Like, they can remember it easily. So I love these Miyoko cups here on TikTok Shop.
