come with us to the property for a pool day in case you're new here we lived on a family count pump for the last four years and we just moved into a rental while we build our house being in the rental is really nice but it does feel like half of our life is still there like our dog Rocky and our tortoises Anna Elsa and Christ not to mention all the reptiles and fish and iguanas and stuff that the kids have in the barn my in laws live here and my husband still works here every day of the week but it still feels like we left half of our heart here cannot wait till our house is finished and we're all back together again we have literally no idea when it's gonna be done everything is out of our hands and I'm trying so hard to trust the lord's timing in all of this but I'm getting frustrated but when it's all done it's gonna be beautiful and exactly what we want and that's all that matters
