if you've ever wondered what a full morning looks like working with the cast of Little House on the Prairie you're in for a treat because I'm gonna show you it is very low key because I work from home most of the time I can wear loungewear house nice little mornings get things done I need to get done when I started working with the cast of Little House it primarily started out in social media and now it has turned into a lot more than that I help with marketing and administration rules that need to be accomplished and creative ideas for 2025 which honestly is my forte I'm absolutely so excited for 2025 and everything coming 2024 has been incredible in so many ways I've travelled more this year than I have in my whole life it's been a huge blessing but I have a feeling that in 2025 I'll be traveling even more I'm actually leaving this weekend for my last trip of the year and it is to go visit Columbus Ohio to see if something could potentially happen in 2025 with this company but on the daily stuff it looks like fulfilling orders for dean and meetings and creative ideas and that's how I will be spending the rest of my day bye
