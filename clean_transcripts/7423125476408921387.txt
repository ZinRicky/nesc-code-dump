Here's how much it cost me to be a content creator last month. First I had my chat bot software I use and then what I use for my link in bio which is Stan Store. I then paid for some supplies for an upcoming project from Joann and then my phone payment, my photo editing software, and my email newsletter platform. I then paid for my video editing app, Instagram Meta verified, and then some Google storage. I also ran a bunch of coffee giveaways this month as well. That brings the total I spent this month at three hundred and thirty dollars and forty seven cents. And I also had to buy a new phone which I didn't include in the total.
