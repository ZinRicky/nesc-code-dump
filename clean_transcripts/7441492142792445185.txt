the two questions I reckon I get asked the most are what are my favourite cleaning appliances and do I have a Kärcher discount code so I'm gonna show you 4 tools I can't live without and I don't exactly have a code but I do have a really good PSA cause Kärcher’s Black Friday sale is on now and you can score up to 50% off some of my favourites okay so coming in at No. 1 and I feel like everybody knows this but it's my Kärcher Steam Cleaner it comes with so many different attachments so you can basically tackle any area and it kills up to 99.99% of bacteria just using steam coming in at No. 2 is my Hard Floor Cleaner or as I prefer to call her the Sweepy Moppy Thingy I use it every single day it sweeps and mops at the same time and the way that it just glides across the floor is so effortless and satisfying spot No. 3 was hotly contested but if I have to choose it's gotta be the Water Blaster if you watch my CleanToks you'll see I use this thing all the time and I'm always genuinely surprised at how much I love it and if my husband had a vote he would definitely pop the Kärcher Wet & Dry vacuum in here cause it's just fantastic for renovations but he doesn't have a vote so I'm picking the Window Vac system because it's just perfect for windows mirrors shower glass and condensation if you live in an older home like me a couple of my personal life philosophies are never buy anything at full price and if you have the right tool for the job the job is easier if you wanna make cleaning easier for yourself or a loved one check out the sale cause the tools are great and the savings are impressive and if you're keen to get clean by Christmas I'll pop a link where you'd expect to find it
