this is part 2 of turning my Weird Barbie of a downstairs hallway into something functional and maybe not totally hideous the concrete blocks that you can see was actually the old exterior of the house before they built the extension some 60 odd years ago which is why there's a window in it *was* a window in it cause she really needed to go I did have a couple of comments from people in part 1 which I've linked in the caption telling me that I should have saved the window and aside from the fact that that glass was old and brittle as hell and we've got kids constantly running around here so it could be a hazard just having a window in the middle of an interior wall is weird to me it makes no design sense and it means I can't use the wall for other things so it had to go once we had finished simply demolishing, prewiring insulating, framing GIBing, plastering Panelling, sanding and priming then we were finally ready to paint and I chose this unsurprisingly controversial colour called Tiki Tiki from Dulux if you know me you know that prior to moving in here I spent three years living in a sad beige new build of my own making this house is a beautiful big mid century home and she really suits colour I think she would be an autumn or a winter girlie cause she just looks so good in the jewel tones I played around with different colours in the past here and she's definitely not a pastel girlie which means we need to be all in without colour or all out I don't make the rules, she does but did you know that crimson in interiors was super popular from mid 40s to mid 60s, right around the time that this house was built? and there's a few reasons behind that apparently anyway it had its moment for like 30 years and then it fell out of fashion for another 60 but I think we're seeing a resurgence and maybe I'm just looking for confirmation bias but I'm definitely seeing it everywhere it's all over my Pinterest feed and it's in just about every interiors article that I read So I know it's not just me saying that Crimson is making a comeback so I thought I might try it out in my home and see if I like it and I know not everyone's gonna like it I already heard you in Part 1 but that's okay you don't have to like it I fkn love it. it's giving old money red it's giving heritage it's giving not afraid to try new things and I'm here for it plus it's just paint if I ever get sick of it I can change it somebody asked me how we do the capping at the top so this is how I stand here and supervise while my husband puts these two bits of wood up then it was time to finish the wall with a nice big thick skirt I love using big thick skirting boards in this home because that's what all of the original areas had and it feels like a bit of an homage to time gone by which is kinda all I wanna do here our amazing sparkies came back to do the final fit off and we did have to wait a little bit to get our hands on these copper lights but I think it was worth it quick reminder of where we started and this is where we ended up Itâ€™s still not done because eventually we're gonna replace the carpet and I still need to decorate obviously I'm gonna turn this space into Memory Lane with family photos all the way along and this is just hallway phase 1 cause it's gonna take us a bit of time to get it up the stairs and right to the front door but yeah what do you think so far?
