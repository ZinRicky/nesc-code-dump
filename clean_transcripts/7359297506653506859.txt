if you haven't already heard this story this guy was caught filming up women's dresses at target another woman in a different part of the store noticed that he was following her she got the ick and she started following him and then caught him actually trying to stick his camera underneath a different unsuspecting woman's dress while she was crouched down looking for something he immediately placed quit I wasn't doing anything please nice guy like it's so important to see that the bad guys are not dressed like bad guys they're not mean and scary they are the nerdy little gentle guy that tries to fly under the radar when someone has bad intentions for you they're not gonna make that known and upfront
