I think the internet has genuinely corrode people's ability to communicate with others it has made everyone view others as so disposable that they are not worth a conversation like watching creators come on to the internet and like cause drama and strife when you could just pick up a phone send a little text every time I see a creator bring interpersonal beef to the internet that could have been handled personally because like you were connected to this person you were friends something it's just like watching it is really embarrassing and just like it's like sad because like you can't even speak to this person like a human being you needed the public so badly to be involved into this in this issue when you could have resolved it like what happened to conflict resolution like what happened to like being able talk to people in your life like communicate like normal like not everything needs to be as dramatic as we make it on the internet and I just think that like everyone had become so obsessed with clicks and views like they forgotten that the people in our screens are actual human beings like they are people as well it's just like it's just so disappointing to watch we need to bring back conflict resolution skill we need to bring back interpersonal communication like we just we need to bring back being able to like talk to people talk to your community talk to your neighbours like like the person that you're speaking to in your phone is the same as the person next door like not every fight also has to be like the end of a relationship I think it'd be really beneficial for people to be able to like resolve a conflict within a relationship and then continue that relationship you know what I mean obviously like for people online maybe it's different but like in general I think we as people have kind of lapsed on our ability to resolve conflict within one another but like learn to pick up a phone like honestly 99% of the time when there's an issue that I have I would rather call someone like call a creator call a friend call whoever or speak to the face to face and it's so much easier to handle the situation than texting than social media then like whatever it just like I just really need people to learn how to communicate that's all
