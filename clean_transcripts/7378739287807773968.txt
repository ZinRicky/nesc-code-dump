I'm trying to work out if this was a crafting success or not because hear me out but I think bamboo just looks terrible in this house especially against that very orange very mid century wood so every time I see this little book stand I don't like it So I thought I would try and give it a second chance at life by attempting that textured paint trend which I've seen all over my TikTok I ended up mixing about a cup of some leftover Dulux paint that I had in shade Half Glinks Gully which is the same beautiful creamy neutral which you've seen me use right throughout my house and through that I stirred a heaped teaspoon maybe slightly more of some baking powder then I lightly sanded the surface before we got to work and I say “we” because my daughter was desperate to help her job was to get the paint literally everywhere and my job was to go in and refine the finish to try and make it look a little bit like ceramic or maybe stone well that's the goal anyway Once I was happy with the finish on the outside I needed to wait for it to dry before I could flip it over and paint the inside my little helper was not quite ready to be finished with painting So we needed to go find something else and I remembered that I have this vase and I really love the shape but she was looking a little bit beat up and scratched with age so I thought why not see how the same treatment works on her also at this point it was an activity so I thought let's just run with it I had worked out at this point that when it's about 50% dry it's a good time to go back in with that wet brush and add a bit more texture and when everything was fully coated and fully dry this is how it turned out it's definitely got that texture and it looks much better against the wood than the bamboo did I love that it's having a second life and I love looking at it and being reminded of time with my little girl and I really like how the vase turned out it definitely gave it that stone effect and now that you can't see the scratches or scuff marks I'm quite happy to have it back on display but what do you think, would you try this?
