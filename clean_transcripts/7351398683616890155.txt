You should never change yourself in order to have people like you You should never be afraid to be your true authentic self, your silly goofy self You should never change yourself in order to please others because number one people will dislike you regardless for absolutely no reason there's just people out there that you're not gonna vibe with and understanding that will be so much energy to spend on people who actually value you No. two you end up disliking yourself when you change yourself for others If youâ€™re constantly people pleasing or changing yourself order to have people like you then at the end of the day you're only going to didlike yourself and yes we all want everyone to like us but at what cost? why would we lose ourselves in that process? Whose it actually helping and who is actually hurting in the process? You should always be your truest authentic self If people don't like you then that's a sacrifice you'll have to make. Stop caring about what other people think about you, and start living your life for you. Your people will find you, so stop worrying about other people liking you.
