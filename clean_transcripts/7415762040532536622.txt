toddlers can smell weakness better than any wild animal tonight my husband's working late he has a seminar it's something he does this happens not a lot but happens somewhat often and on those nights I put all three kids to sleep now that wasn't the plan I planned ahead I had our part time nanny she came after school today I was like okay you're gonna do the baby I'll do the big kids because I want them all to get to bed super early because we're um we have a really really early morning tomorrow that toddler was not having it he wanted mom which is totally fine he's the youngest I totally get it when mom's around he wants mom that kid fought me tooth and nail tooth and nail to go to bed tonight he was overtired he was super cranky there I was like a half wounded fawn with my freaking jugular hanging out with no backup two other kids waiting for me to come do books and that kid pulled out all the stops tonight they can tell they can tell when you have something big the next morning and you like really need to get to bed early they can tell when you don't have your backup you're trying to do like quick bedtime routine every other night this week went down like a dream we've been getting faster and faster I've even given myself a little pat on the back for how good I've been at putting that toddler to bed you know what he said he said fuck you fuck you for being confident I smell fear I smell desperation and I'm going to hit you where it hurts Tyler's man
