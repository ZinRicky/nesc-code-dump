I’ve talked about the modern day trad wife before modern day traditional wives who are out there taking care of their man who are generally hot they take care of themselves and they usually cook, clean do all the house chores like they did back in the 50s with ease they don't complain they're happy why are they happy they trust their man to lead the relationship they respect him depend on their man there's nothing wrong with that ladies they usually have their own business so they're not just depending on their man for money they're depending on their man for love, trust, loyalty They’re not with their man for money they might even make more money than their man and they're still doing all the household chores and satisfying their partners needs because they like to basically they get enjoyment out of life by taking care of their partner these women are pretty rare but you do see them running around they’re the happiest women out there No, we're not in the 50s anymore the year is 2024 but these women are still taking the ideology that they should take care of their man take care of their house take care of themselves They basically are just thriving in life I don't know what do you guys think
