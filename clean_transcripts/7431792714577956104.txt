recommend for almost all couples you take your paychecks put it in the joint checking account okay don't don't do that Doctor Zoe and I'm here to tell you not to do that this man is recommending that couples should put their paychecks directly into the joint account first and then the joint account like pays them a little stipend each why is this in particular harmful towards women I'm also having a joint account we opened a joint account the other day for the first time um because my partner's from the UK we need we need to do it for the visa but getting paid into your joint account and then getting a stipend means that your partner is basically mutually giving you a little bit of pocket money and has complete oversight over you what you spend your money on and your finances this approach does not account for when things go wrong this approach is designed to and is a is a basically hoax back to the era where women couldn't leave domestic violence or just couldn't leave for whatever reason because they didn't have the financial independence to do so and your partner has complete oversight into how much money you're getting they can track your spending more easily and financial abuse is on the rise it's one of the newer recognised categories of abuse but is very much uh valid and very very severe form of abuse in fact almost all physical abuse is preceded by financial abuse it's a part of the abuse cycle the abuser needs to make sure that you can't get away even in situations where the couple wanna stay together and then start abuse I believe that you should still have complete control of your paychecks and they should go into your account and as a woman like this is very gendered this issue just because you know we've just had the 50 year anniversary of women being able to get their own credit card it was not that long ago that men had complete say over our lives through our finances it's not a very far leap from okay I get a little stipend we share all our finances except for my little stipend two where did your money go you should have this much left what did you spend that on why did you buy that experience in an abusive relationship I was tormented for wanting to spend $5 on a pair of denim shorts while my boyfriend at the time sat there in the cafe where the second hand shorts were on sale and was drinking two five dollar beverages it's not really about the money it's about the control five dollar shorts I did not buy new clothes myself for over a year in that relationship because even though he didn't have oversight into my actual accounts he was still tryna control my spending he did this in numerous way I was never a big shopper and when we broke up I went and spent $500 um at H&M that it just opened um yeah fast fashion but anyway I was just I felt like I've been released from financial prison and ever since then I found that like buying clothes and things for myself is almost this like symbol of freedom for me um freedom from those in trappings do not take this advice my mother taught me a couple things and she always said keep your own bank account
