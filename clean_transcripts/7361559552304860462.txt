this is not an original thought I just cannot get over the fact that after everything that is happening in this country the fact that no one can get a job no one has money no one can afford anything inflation is through the roof people literally cannot afford rent we're criminalizing homelessness the United States is funding a genocide and the most important issue is banning TikTok I like I am just so flabbergasted and like I know why I know why they're doing it I just like how can you still fully stand 10 toes down and say the United States is the best country in the world we still have freedom of speech like you are not rooted in reality
