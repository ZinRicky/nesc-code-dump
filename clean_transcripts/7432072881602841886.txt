I definitely feel like it's true to size. I wear a large. I ordered a large. It fits me with all the same amount of room. I always have the arms come down pretty long. Long enough for me. I'm tall, and usually things will be a little short. But it works. I love this thing so much. It's just so cute. It can go over anything. And I just love that these three buttons and the way that this little detail is here, it makes it look like it's a pullover. I don't know why. That makes it feel fancier, but it's not. It's like the ease of a little jacket, but it's not heavy like a jacket. It's a little jacket. I love it. It's linked right here.
