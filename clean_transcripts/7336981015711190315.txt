this might be so controversial to post but um I know that on this app you can very easily be labeled a misogynist if you criticize ⚪️ women um so I hope that as an Asian woman who is very much a feminist I hope I can just say this and also as a woman who has talked a lot about her feelings on this app and in my writing talked so much about my personal experiences and my personal feelings I'm kinda sick of ⚪️ girl bloggers I'm kind of sick of ⚪️ women who write and talk about their feelings and their personal experiences because the things that they keep writing about just feel especially frivolous to me in times like these like with everything going on in the news with everything going on in the news and not just the news abroad but the news domestically everything that's happening with like women's rights and reproductive rights in United States um it all just feels so silly and frivolous to me and like I I try to read the essays I try to like be in the know of like what's popular among the girl writers and I'm just like I don't care like I I get like I get a couple paragraphs in and I'm like I just don't it's not gripping to me um and I personally this is also some self criticism and some self reflection that I've done I've really put the breaks on talking about myself on this app um with everything that's been happening since October because it just feels so frivolous and stupid to say and women's experiences matter women's stories matter when it comes to women's rights and feminism our stories and our experiences matter and we need to keep sharing them it's just the ones that the ⚪️ women keep sharing it's just the ones that the ⚪️ women keep talking about I'm like I'm just so unimpressed
