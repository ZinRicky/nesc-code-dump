I have a mom hack that will change your life literally hi I'm Chelsea a 31 year old homeschool mom and if you're anything like me you prepare a lot of snacks and meals for your kids our day starts with breakfast then second breakfast and then a snack lunch five more snacks dinner another snack and then a bedtime snack does that sound familiar if so you need to start making snack boards it's basically a charcuterie board filled with fruits veggies and your kid's favourite snacks you serve it at lunch and let it sit on the counter until dinner instead of asking for snacks right after lunch or while you're cooking they can help themselves to whatever is left on the snackboard since I started doing these my kids no longer ask me for snacks and they have increased the amount of fruits and veggies they eat throughout the day it is a win win in my book I switch up what I put on the board each day so they don't get bored of it and I let them pick out what they want from the grocery store so they're guaranteed to eat it there's also a great way to cut back on food waste
