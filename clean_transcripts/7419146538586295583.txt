Here's everything I made today to make sure we have food to eat. I started off the day with some protein scrambled eggs from my backyard chickens and then had a bowl of the only cereal I would buy because it's got friendly organic made with only real ingredients and unrefined sugar. It's also gluten free with prebiotic fiber from casaba root. It's so good and I had it with raw milk. Next I shaped a freshly milled sourdough bowl that I had started the day before. After fermenting all night at room temperature, I did a quick counter, then shaped it into a round and sewed it up to do its final proof in a flowered banaton. Later I made my OG banana bread. It's gluten free free and made with fermented buckwheat. Fun fact this is one of the first recipes I ever developed. It took me so many times to get it right and it's honestly so perfect. You should give it a try too! The buckwheat ferments for 24 hours on the counter and the final batter whips up in one bowl in just a few minutes. Flowed up with healthy fats from pasture raised eggs and shredded coconut and tastes delicious with coconut oil or raw butter. Towards dinner time, I prep some 100% grass fed beef from my parents farm by combining 4 pounds of meat with the variety of dried spices, herbs, salt and pepper, eggs, raw milk, and shredded cheese. I bake The meatballs at 4:25 for 20 minutes. While those baked, I made some pickled onions and then started on preparing a Greek salad. I threw a bunch of chopped basil in and then whisked up a simple salad dressing of pickled onion, vinegar, olive oil, Dijon, and salt and pepper. This salad was so fresh and crisp. Dinner was freshly milled iron cream, sourdough, and a Greek salad with meatballs on top.
