and I wanna talk about it um I could see how that transformed my romantic relationships so saying this type of thing is like saying the value of a relationship by implying that however I wanna unpack the statement a little bit and really could get to therapy and love myself where women's worth is not contingent upon the relationships that they're in these relationships aren't existing in a vacuum why your self worth might be impacting your relationships in a negative way because I don't like it when women's self esteem is tied to their relationships you need to go and do more work to make sure it doesn't happen again all the time but we're also judging women for the man that they're with um that it is actually really really hard to leave and women fear judgement as well that they haven't left and for example and I don't think that that you know why are you in that relationship or um because they feel a certain pressure has been doing the rounds on TikTok you also can risk going into victim blaming territory and this type of statement also unfairly places the burden of we know that women feel a lot of external social pressures rather than look at external social pressures there's so much manipulation and gaslighting and fear gender based violence or coercive control relationships I've come to a very similar conclusion myself over the last couple of years it really doesn't capture like the complex power dynamics that um um she might find it economically hard to leave I think that it is really important that we are able to also take into account otherwise you just leave and I just don't think that's true firstly I think there's a lot of merit to this statement what what like the simplification that we see when we over psychologist everything and I think that if it is um or to have a certain level of wealth that this isn't just exist the cycle of abuse is such that is really hard to just leave these relationships gender norms that have traditionally judged women based on who they're with that can be distilled down to a simple like might influence your relationship it really doesn't encapsulate people's experiences who are in domestic violence um that exist outside of their own inner life I know I did that I didn't leave rather than individuals in their own right but especially in relationships with men for example through a partner um choices so not necessarily heterosexual relationships the type of relationship that you're in is a reflection of your own self esteem it's great to go and seek help for that I think that the statement also props up gender norms but now it's like oh my biggest concern about the statement is the way that like a lot of self esteem work and allowed me to be really clear about my expectations if a woman was in like a financially abusive relationship um and that's been a real gift and something that has only come through so and this is firstly I do think it's important to reflect how your own self worth but I guess like um this to do with like women's inherent self love and self esteem and been thinking about it a lot in the context of myself and relationships like I don't think it's that far of a jump from saying that to then saying well she just doesn't love herself you just must not love yourself enough I think statements like this shift the blame from you just leave him and we know that it's not that easy to conform to the gender roles that have been laid out for them which is something that we're trying to not do anymore we know women cop the blame a lot for things that don't go right with the house kind of blamed for or the health of relationship on the woman I can totally understand why rings true for so many people which I think we do tend to do these days I'm Doctor Zoe and I have a PhD in feminism like what did you do wrong to get yourself into that situation like a perpetrator to the victim and put a lot of self blame on themselves the statement also speaks to get therapy and unpack um um and I know just his partner that she chooses we face external social pressures to get married and to have children because I worry that it's just yet another thing that women are judged and if you loved yourself enough we're now not only judging women for all the things that women are judged for but I cringe a little bit when I see it and become not just okay with exist in those relationships I think as someone who has taken the time to be alone I just don't think it's that simple I think we're working towards a world here the statement or the kids or the relationship so and the relationships of my friends well why don't you just leave him it's also really a lot to do with how women will settle but excited about a life with just me myself without feeling too much and to be clear about my boundaries early on cause I really would hesitate to use it myself why the fuck does she have a good point right now look you can tell how much a woman loves herself by the partner she chooses
