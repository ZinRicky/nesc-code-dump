so Matt and I are at Animal Kingdom today our big kids stayed out late and they didn't want to come with us this morning they were boots they wanted to sleep in and do the pool so we're here on a solo adventure and we were sitting in the line so and there was a kid behind us talking up a lot like coughing like sick coughing and you know as a parent you know like a deep thought and I just as a parent I'm so bored I understand you don't wanna ruin your trip or like change your plans but there's certain activities that you can do that are more outdoors that are more promisent of like germ spreading and indoor closed theater is like not the best place to bring a kid who is noticeably sick so here's to hoping in three to five business days I don't come down with some sort of like plague or covid or flu because odds are not in my favor
