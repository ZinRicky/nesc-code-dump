Magnets on your fridge is like the best way to add personality to an otherwise boring kitchen sometimes. And I found these fridge beats. It's this magnet that looks like a little music tile and it even has like the little circle green button. They are having a Black Friday and Christmas sale, but it's 1995 for the classic and 2595 for the upgraded version. There's a ton of different designs too. It doesn't have to be this multi grid of pictures. It's just the cutest thing ever. I absolutely love it and it makes for the perfect gift.
