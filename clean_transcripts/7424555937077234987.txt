okay hear me out so I think that we need to force men to donate their organs to save all of the kids who are dying on the organ donor list every year oh no see so widely available research demonstrates that that would have devastating impacts on men it would increase the male mortality rate it would keep them in poverty force them into poverty have devastating impacts on their mental health and I'm really concerned about like taking away their bodily autonomy also we don't even let that happen to dead people This is what we call a reasonable difference of opinion  that it's terrible public policy we know it spikes the male mortality rate I know or our wires are getting crossed here okay see so like 2,000 years ago there's a woman in the sky see her name is goddess and she has a daughter named Jess who was like 2,000 years ago on earth and she had these 12 female best friends and they wrote a book which describes how this is men's duty so that should clear things up no to me you're just describing your imaginary friend and your favorite fictional old book much more interested in what today's doctors and research shows We will have to agree to disagree and I am going to force men to do it anyways
