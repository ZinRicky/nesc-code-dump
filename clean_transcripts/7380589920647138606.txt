this is one of my all time favourite chicken owner products and let me tell you why bone chickens for about six years I've had this chicken breast spiral for about four years and I love it I think this egg holder looks really cool but my favourite thing about it is that it always make sure that I have the oldest egg first so this egg goes in first and then I'm gonna always take the egg from the bottom and that way I always have the oldest egg four years later and it's still perfect click the orange link below to get yours today with free shipping
