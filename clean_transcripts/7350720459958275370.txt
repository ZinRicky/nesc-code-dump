Here in the southwest, we are obsessed with our flannels, so I got some from Angry Minnow. I've heard such good things about them, and these ones are so cute. They are soft and comfy and unique. I also got this cool dress. I love wearing dresses, and this one is so casual and comfy. Stay tuned to see how I wear them.
