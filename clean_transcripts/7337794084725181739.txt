I will show you how I do my bun. I use a satin scrunchie, cause it's less likely to get knotted up in my hair. And you're right, I do just throw it up, all my hair up messy, like in a ponytail. And then I pull it through, but not all the way through. And then pull it through again, but not all the way through again. And that's it. And then as I talk, it bops and falls down my head. And that's it.
