set up the school day with me I plan for the whole week on Sunday but I do the day to day stuff in the morning on a rare occasion I might get it set up the night before but I'm usually doing it in the morning before we start our lesson I know this doesn't work for everybody but it works for us if I set it out the night before there's a good chance my kids mess it up in the morning or they're wanting to start first thing right away and I am just not ready for it yet so I get up a little early and by early I mean seven get some me time in drink a protein shake make my coffee and then I get ready for the day this point my kids have had breakfast and are off doing some kind of make believe something somewhere in the house they're also avoiding me because they know once I get this done it is time to get started for the day every day consists of some kind of independent work usually handwriting and with the code and I really only do independent work because we do so much family style learning that I want them to learn how to do work on their own if you watch any of my other videos you know we do a lot of hands on learning around there's usually a lot of moving parts to our lessons so I try to make sure I have everything I need organised and ready to go so I'm not searching for things in the middle of a lesson it really helps to minimize distractions and help us get done with our lessons a lot faster now could I do all of this before the day of absolutely but we all have our flaws and this is mine
