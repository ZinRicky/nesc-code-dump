My toddler woke up with a cough and a slight sore throat this morning and when I checked the fridge I realized we were all out of cough syrup, so it was definitely time for a restock. I started by peeling one lemon, moving on to peeling a good amount of ginger. I don't know what it is about peeling ginger, but it's always so hard for me. I poured some filtered water into my pot, added my ginger, my lemon peel, some fresh thyme, and also some lemon balm. I usually just eyeball the ingredients, put that on the stove to simmer for about 45 minutes and then turn the heat off and just let it cool down while I get started on mixing some honey and the juice of about two small lemons. Sometimes I do three. I squeeze them through a fine mesh strainer, making sure that I don't get any of the seeds in. My herbal mixture is warm and not hot anymore. I strain that as well, making sure to get every last drop before giving that a really good mix and we're all done. I usually store this in the fridge, especially during cold and flu season, and give them a few spoonfuls throughout the day.
