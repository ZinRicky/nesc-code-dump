yeah we need to talk about this I'm so glad you bring it up okay so in November Florida residents are going to be able to vote in a ballot initiative to protect abortion rights in their state constitution Republicans know that Americans in red states and in blue states overwhelmingly support abortion access they generally hate ballot initiatives they do not want the issue of abortion to be in voters hands they managed to stick some really gross language onto this ballot initiative in a financial impact statement telling Florida residents that this initiative would result in fewer live earths in Florida per year and at that may have a negative financial impact on the state right off the bat they're literally just saying um reproductive rights hinders our ability to control women's reproduction which hinders our ability to capitalize on their unpaid reproductive labor gross but it's also just completely wrong to the extent that you're gonna put a financial impact statement it should say something like forcing families to birth children that they already have told you that they can't afford has devastating financial impacts for families are also just completely wrong and trying to trick voters into thinking that but denying abortions equals more babies research shows it doesn't men who are denied a wanted abortion are much less likely to have a planned pregnancy later on let's use an example let's say we have Emma and Sam who are both pregnant and wants an abortion Emma receives one Sam does not Emma is much more likely to have planned pregnancies later off Sam is not so Emma may go on to have three children whereas Emma only has one so they're trying to suggest to voters that if you deny women wanted abortions we will see a nut increase in the state's population and that's completely incorrect the whole thing is literally so gross and ignorant and awful
