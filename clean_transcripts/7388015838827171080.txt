we renovated this room multiple times as in more than once okay it was twice but multiple times does sound more impressive actually I don't know if “impressive” is the word that I'm looking for “indecisive” might be more accurate anyway so clearly this commenter didn't like it and my only response is oh no, that's a real shame that you didn't like what I did to my own house but it does make me wonder which vibe are you picking? if you had to live here would you live in the mustard or would you prefer the navy? let me know!! 💙💛
