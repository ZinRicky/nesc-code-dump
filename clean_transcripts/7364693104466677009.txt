and it's not it's just not about them like this is about me being happy for other women who would making those choices it's actually got very little to do with men at all but we're enabled culturally more and more and I'm shedding some of the ideas and the kind of but if you want a good laugh doing a job that we choose to do we're not man haters we're just choosing to live our best lives it's more and more accepted for women to make those choices I'm just so bored like just calling us man haters I have the opportunity to live a life on my own terms that's why we have a patriarchy because it was found that women's we have the education about our rights men reveal how they do believe the world is revolving around them to use our bodies as a vessel for spawning the next generation we have those choices to make of an ageing population then perhaps because if governments are really worried about that crisis so this is about women going we still stigmatised for our choices these are the same people who I'm sure would be racist and against immigration we have the option to go and open a bank account the option to not have children and not be too stigmatised about it it's it's yeah by the way and once again pretty much to suppress women into one specific box and one specific role and education um we have the option to go and do IVF if we do want children discovering that power the discovery of women's power is so powerful but we have the option to do all of those things it's a policy issue women are just gonna import wives anyway okay cultural norms associated with what I should do we're not only gonna see women making choices for women for themselves it's about women going how can I get the most out of my life all designed women are too powerful proving that men need us when we don't need them they should think about creating a world that's not as hostile and there's been laws and rituals and cultures and religions once again in my comment section and legislative changes that have given us our rights back they do believe that everything that women do is about men and we don't have responsibility gross um tell us tell us who you are we're not only enabled by these kinds of policies cause the men are pressed about this and they're like a lot of the time for the first time ever we're happy about it we're not making a decision to fight men to do whatever I want with my life okay sure but population control is not a women's issue as well we're seeing that start to shed I now have the option probably for the first time in history and potentially also remain childless um because this is all a reaction to women finding a power go and get a mortgage go and buy a house how can I make the most of this opportunity but those are our choices to make but we're gonna see men's um why don't you but again and as we see that shift and change my entire matriarchal lineage and wanting to kinda be left alone to do that a lot of the time ah that it has been suppressed for time memorial we might choose to be with men or with women or with someone else we also have the option to not have children to raise children in don't you care about population control or married or not married or have children or not have children financial empowerment um so that we don't have an age population crisis and that's why because everything men do is about women and things like simple things like birth control um cracking a little tantrum in the comments saying well sociologists are predicting that women will increasingly choose to remain single like I for the first time in my entire generation go and look at the comments we have things like the ability to go out and earn our own income corresponding identity crisis and reaction to that empowerment it's about them choosing to live their best lives because we have the knowledge of how lucky we are that support things like abortion bans and in the comments you can really see the types of attitudes that exist and stepping in to the empowerment that we actually deserve it's it's very little to do with men threatening to import women okay and once again this isn't about me as an individual so not only are we actually in a tangible sense enabled through um women choosing not to be with men as they are increasingly doing is not because they hate men
