these are my morning thoughts because I woke up to some comments I'm like hmm interesting the internet is such a damned if you do damned if you don't place like nobody is ever going to be satisfied with what you share so two weeks ago during Helene I share that we got hit by a tornado and I got comments from people in my own area like oh that's fake that didn't happen that didn't happen but that was our experience we lived it we got hit by a tornado and now this time around with Milton I share that we personally could not tell that there was a Hurricane we woke up and everything was fine now I know that that was not everybody's experience I understand that but I'm not here to show you anybody else's experience or the destruction all around my city I'm here to show you my experience and my experience was we woke up and you couldn't tell it was peaceful and so we just need to like accept the fact that our reality isn't going to be someone else's we can live in the same place have two totally different experiences and it's all okay and we don't need to comment on people's videos if we don't agree with what they say
