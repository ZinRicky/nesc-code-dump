why isn't there the same level of outcry when Republican legislators and elected officials do stuff like this like when Idaho Republicans rejected $6 million in free federal funding to support early childhood education and development because I don't think anybody does a better job than mothers in the home and any Bill that makes it easier or more convenient for mothers to come out of the home and let others raise their child I don't think that's a good direction for us to be going that is Representative Charlie Shepherd who still is in the Idaho Legislature how about when Mark Robinson who is the current lieutenant governor in North Carolina said I absolutely want to go back to the America where women couldn't vote about the fact that in Missouri Arkansas and Texas pregnant women are prevented from getting a divorce these three states also have total abortion bans women in the US today are also being criminally charged for their miscarriages under the prosecution's argument that she actually intentionally caused her own miscarriage Republicans are coming after no fault divorce because they wanna make it harder to obtain a divorce which 70% of which are initiated by women they don't want to let women out of their marriages I'm not saying there shouldn't be backlash over this football kicker who managed to get a microphone but what I am saying is that there are a lot of Republican legislators right now an elected officials who are enacting law and policy to affectuate this man's vision for women and America in our role and society and we need to apply that same level of backlash if not even more to them
