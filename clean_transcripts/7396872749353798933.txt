I've got about an hour before I need to head out for school pick up which always coincides with the time of the day where I'm the most tired that I've ever been in my entire life and I find that the only thing that helps me with that is a little snacky snack I started by making a smoothie with some frozen banana Ceres organics cacao powder protein powder dates oats ice and oat milk And because I've got a major sweet tooth especially at this time of the day I'm gonna need a little treat all three flavours of the Ceres Organic Fudgy Bites are legitimately delicious but today I'm going for the chocolate raspberry because it's my favourite they decadent but also wholesome because they made out of organic whole food ingredients but tasting them you wouldn't know it cause they do taste kind of naughty I think it's probably the rich chocolatey taste and the soft fudge centre that's doing it it really does feel like a treat but I know it's good for me so I'm pleased about that so I'm gonna do a little admin and enjoy my delicious moment of self care before the chaos of the afternoon shift begins
