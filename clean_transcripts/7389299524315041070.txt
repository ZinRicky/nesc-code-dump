I'm probably gonna regret making this video after the comment section on my previous video about this topic went to the wrong side of the internet but parents you don't have to be your child's first bully there were so many dads in the comments of one of my previous videos telling me that it is their duty to let their child know that they're fat and that body shaming could motivate them to get in better shape the reason there are no women agreeing with that sentiment is because we know what it feels like to grow up in this world in a female body as a woman as a girl this world will never let you forget where you stand in the hierarchy and what your shortcomings are like a father stitched my video and told me that he tells his eight year old that she's chubby or too chubby to wear certain clothes and he thinks that makes him a good dad because he's honest when what he's actually doing is chipping away at any possibility of that girl to develop self worth what a good parent does is let their child know that they have inherent value as a human being and although there is a conversation to be had about the politics of beauty and the power that your proximity to the beauty standard will grant you in this life you are justifying calling your kid fat or telling them their body is a problem you are a bad parent period this world is not a nice place for women the best thing you can do as a parent is support your child foster self worth and self confidence best thing you can do as a parent is to foster self esteem and self worth and value teach your children how to maintain a healthy body how to eat nutritiously how to move their body how to maintain longevity of function of their bodies because you only get one and then after that teach them about the beauty standard teach them about advertising teach them about the messages that young girls will be receiving as they grow up in this world and how it is meant to diminish their power and their self esteem young girls are not dumb they will have enough bullies in this life what they need from their parents is a safe place and everyone got their panties in a twist because I was talking about dads in that video I make so many videos about the beauty standard about almond moms about how moms talk about their their daughter's bodies all the internalized misogyny about that but you know what never happens in those comment sections women being like what about dads what about the men how dare you make this about women y'all are telling on yourselves build your kids up don't tear them down it's a pretty simple parenting tip
