I’m gonna be honest okay please don't tell the new age feminist this but I would 100% rather stay home, cook and clean 100% rather do that okay I love to cook and I love to clean and organize Shh feminists shh, I know okay But I love to cook good food and I love to clean and I love to do it for my man truly I do, however, if that's expected outside of marriage hard pass that actually sounds like you're taking care of a child but the look on a man's face when you cook for him, clean for him, do anything to please him, that's what it's all about. watching him admire you with his blissfully happy eyes it just, it melts your heart There’s just something in me as a woman that makes me feel like this whole traditional/wife living isn't such a terrible thing why did we actually want to work? what was the idea or perspective of pursuing a career? there’s nothing more satisfying than having a man that takes care of you A true gentlemen that provides for you, you don't have to worry about anything if you do that, I'll cook and clean all day! why would I complain? I'll make you an incredible five course meal if it means I can stay at home what did we fight for again as woman, because I'd much rather be exhausted from cooking and cleaning for my family than be exhausted as career driven woman working a job I don't like You can hate me all you want, but I'd 100% rather stay home and be provided for by my man and take care of him in return
