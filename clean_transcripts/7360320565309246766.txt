I just love the goodness in people okay I'm sorry I'm a little emotional I just watched a video of this guy he's a whyte man he was talking basically about how like Arab men were really helpful to him when he was homeless and like would feed him when he was homeless and how like an entire Arab community like basically made sure that this man was fed and I just being Arab there's like a lot of complicated feelings with my culture and whatever however one thing that I am so proud of is that I know that my people like go out of their way to care and like share with their community with Arab families like you fight to pay for the check you like you literally like when you get to the table you are you are fighting to make sure that you can treat your friend you are giving gifts like you are you are caring for the people that you love and that's what I group around and it's just like even if you don't always have it like that you're going to make sure like the people that come to your house are fed you're always gonna have something for them like my dad and I have always had a very complicated relationship but no matter what the situation that man always make sure that I have groceries fruits vegetable that I have enough water like that's how we shows love by making sure that we are cared for it's through actions like Arabs they they show their love through their action and in America we are so villainized and like like any community we have our issue but I just love the way that we love and the way we care about people that we love and it's just such a blessing to have been raised by a family of immigrants who cares about their community and the people that they love in a way that you just don't always see in America
