when I talk about boundaries that I've had to set with family members after having children a lot of people think they're like crazy things that I have requested from my family members but in my opinion they are really common sense things for example or I'll give you all a couple examples um we have to leave functions for our child's bedtime this to me doesn't seem like a crazy thing it just means that the priority is making sure our child goes down at the regular bedtime because if you've had a tough sleeper you know that bedtime is bedtime and if someone doesn't respect that or someone tries to make you feel guilty for that or someone tries to push you to stay longer oh they're gonna be fine don't make it such a big deal you you shouldn't have to leave like you're being a helicopter parent that's not respectful of a your priority as a parent or b your boundary of like no I already told you I have to leave at this time another completely reasonable example for us was that everybody had to get vaccinated before they came to see our child and this was even pre covid so like this is 2014 for with our first as per the pediatrician's recommendation all visitors for a Newborn had to be vaccinated for flu and had to make sure they had an updated Tdap we got a little bit of pushback that I was not expecting and that was one of those hard boundary lines where I was like no if you are not vaccinated you're not coming to see the baby so again when I'm talking about setting boundaries with family especially surrounding having children becoming a parent having them and their safety and well being being a priority there is no wiggle room but that doesn't mean that these boundaries are anything that is um or should be unexpected or not easy to a abide by I know a lot of people have the take shoes off when you come in the house because my baby's crawling around or just like general cleanliness it's simple things like that when you get pushed back for that you start to question the level of respect that that person has for you or what boundaries you're gonna put in place or the way you're gonna navigate that relationship going forward
