Get ready with me as I make party food for my 3 year old's birthday party. As someone who avoid seed oils, refined sugars, artificial flavors, and food dyes at all cost, I started in the morning by preparing my sourdough pizza by freshly milling primitive wheat into whole grain flour and then making with my sourdough starter, which I hadn't fed in over 24 hours. I covered my dough with compostable cling wrap and let that ferment all day. Next, I started making a birthday cake. First, I whipped up the cake battery process that takes only 30 minutes using eggs from my hands. While the rounds baked, I whipped up some homemade buttercream icing a 15 minute process using a touch of spirulina to naturally dye it for my little boy. Then I got to making a fish ceviche which included chopped tomatoes, those red onions, cilantro, mango, salt and pepper, and lots of citrus juice. I let that marinate in the fridge and continued on by making a homemade ranch dip for carrot crudite taste. This dip is so good and easy to make. I just mixed together some dried spices, salt and pepper, and then move that to the fridge. Now it's time to shape the sourdough into pizza balls so this can rise a bit. Before making pizza. I make some pickled red onions by heating some vinegar, water, salt, coconut sugar, and a bay leaf and then dress the big salad. I mix it With a champagne vinaigrette just as the party's about to start. Then I replayed the CBJ and finish it with a vinegar concoction from the pickled onions and a bunch of avocado pieces. I start pumping out fresh to order pizza for the guests, which cook on the outdoor grill for a perfectly crispy thin crust. And I forgot to video my homemade vanilla ice cream, but this was used to accompany the birthday cake, the star of the evening.
