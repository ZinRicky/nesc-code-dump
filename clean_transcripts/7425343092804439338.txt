how beautiful it is for women toâ€¦maybe just step aside and prioritize their family and spend time with their children can you imagine if we had a religion based on a Goddess in the sky who had a daughter named Jess who came to earth like 2,000 years ago and she had these 12 besties and they wrote a book together about how men just naturally belong in the home and one of the only strong male characters was the Virgin Marcus and men also aren't allowed to have leadership roles in this church and then we used this book as justification to enact policies that make it difficult for men to ever leave the home and we say it's a really commendable job but we also don't pay them for it and then if they do ever leave we complain about how he left and stole half her income and we've also never had a male president but none of it's in like a sexist way men are just stepping aside they're not being pushed aside they're just stepping aside that's really beautiful and if anyone takes issue with any of it they are being disrespectful towards our religion so
