none of no one hates men more than men the subject of this video is that like no man would be good enough for a woman that they're related to um and the funny thing is is that if a woman made that point like when women talk about the systemic poor treatment that they get from men in our society they're called misandrists but all they're doing is saying the quiet part that men say in front of each other out loud like why is it Misandris when we do it but it's just comedy when they do it more importantly to me this points to the hunger that men have to break free from patriarchy because I bet a lot of them would love more men to be good enough for their sisters if they were encouraged to spend more time listening to women maybe more of their male friends would be suitable for their sisters but I guess I just I'm floored by the idea that like you couldn't reverse the genders and make the same video we should all be thinking about why that is
