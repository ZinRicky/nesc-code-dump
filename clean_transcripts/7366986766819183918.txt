if you want to know what your man is really thinking In moments you want him to express himself or share his opinion then do this Disclaimer! I'm not attacking you just, just listen I promise you it's worth it We generally all say that we want our man to open up but are we really giving them a chance to men generally operate in a more logical way of thinking they just take their time before they speak so what you should do is stop talking so much I know y'all are gonna come for me for saying this but just listen we as women just love chatting we love yip yapping it just makes us feel good But this often doesn't allow men to express themselves, why? because it takes them longer to respond what you should do is when you're asking a question take a 30 second pause, count in your head thirty seconds one Mississippi, two Mississippi I know it sounds long and crazy but men just take a little bit longer to respond don't interrupt them with your own thoughts let him think and let him express himself you're likely gonna be amazed by what comes out of his mouth when you're actually listening and giving him time to respond ever since I started doing this with my partner life just got way more interesting because I actually got to hear what he had to say without interruption without just me talking men are just so smart and they add so much value in our lives when you actually listen to them
