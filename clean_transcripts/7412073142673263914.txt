I'm so glad you asked cause I love sharing resources that have helped me because again I'm not an expert I have just found tools that work for us so I'm in our playroom excuse the lights being off the big kids are watching Addams Family this organizer right here I have a little station set up for big feelings this little bin right here and it's a mix of literature books etc and calm toys which I'll also show you this was the first book I got I've had this for years I've used this with my older kids when they were little we've had to revisit it a few times and now I'm using it with my youngest this is a new book I just got off of Amazon to deal with big feelings because we're not just talking about anger and rage all the feelings can get big right I like that one of those books is more non fiction and one is more fiction storybook style I also have this book which is really great for older kids as well this is about body boundaries consent and respect super important especially with kids as they get older I also have a listening to by body book which helps kids identify what types of feelings they are actually feeling worry source another great book to talk about anxiety which I think is then we have a selection of calm toys now we use these with big feelings but also with sensory issues get it you know wiggles this is my personal favourite I think it's so cool and one of the things that we've been teaching our son to do squeezing a ball to release tension or anger is a good one at this point our youngest is starting to actually ask for a squeezy ball for when he's angry these are just some that are available you can find a lot of these on Amazon I will link some in my Amazon storefront and here just for easy access you don't have to buy them through the link it's you can find them anywhere there are tons of kids books about these subjects and they're so well done and if you have any favorites that I don't have drop them in the comments cause I would love to add to our library
