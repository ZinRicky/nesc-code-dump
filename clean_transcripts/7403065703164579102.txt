it was the first day of farm school co op and it felt like I was dropping Maverick off for his first day of kindergarten I basically was because he's technically in kindergarten and this is the first year he's old enough to participate in farm school he was really excited but also a little scared and I had to hide all of my feelings I was a little nervous because he's our shy and quiet kid but he had a blast today he did farm chores planted some flowers ate lunch with new friends and Madison was the absolute best big sister and took care of him and made sure he felt welcomed and introduced him to all the people she knew how was your day good did you have so much fun yeah you're super dirty I'm super hot how was your day good did you have fun yeah and are you getting new friends my shoes might be a little wet that's okay that's why we put you in those shoes mom I wanna tell you why though okay me and Sissy and Romy went fishing no way
