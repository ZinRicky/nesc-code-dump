so depending on which side of the internet you sit on you were gonna see one or the other parents hating on child free people or child free people hating on parents and in my opinion anybody who has to be that negative or dismissive or insulting to people who make different choices have their own shit to unpack but devil's advocate people who choose to be child free so not people who end up there by circumstance people who make that choice are going against the cultural norm and whenever you make any choice that goes against the cultural norm you are gonna get backlash and a lot more backlash than you're ever gonna get in person for making the traditional choice over time that can make somebody bitter and angry it doesn't excuse being an asshole but as we know people on the internet love being a little bit brave and a little bit extra assholely over here I'm gonna go ahead and make another video talking about this whole selfish argument because everyone who either has kids or doesn't have kids is called selfish for their choice by the angry on the opposite side and I think it's time that we kind of all collectively dissect that so we can move forward with this conversation so that'll be the next video I post right after this one
