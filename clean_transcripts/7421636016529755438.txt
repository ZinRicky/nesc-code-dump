I'm unwilling to become pregnant if I don't have unrestricted access to healthcare and that includes abortion rights and if any part of you is thinking they won't I live in a blue state I live in Minnesota they won't enact a national abortion ban they've literally been planning this for 50 years they haven't denied it they have both indicated that they would like to enact a national abortion ban Vance tried to reframe it the other night by saying well it's not really a national abortion ban I'm just an advocate for national minimum standards that's the exact same thing as an abortion ban saying that throughout the country you can't get an abortion past six weeks 15 weeks whatever arbitrary number they come up with maternal mortality rate in Texas alone has jumped 56% one part of it is obviously fear right I don't wanna become pregnant and need emergency healthcare and not be able to receive it and or die but another part of it is like if what my government sees me is as a reproductive vessel who doesn't have um her own free will control over her body know what she needs have her own destiny that is valued then I don't wanna give you what you I'm not gonna do that I really don't wanna do reproductive labor for you
