this was a really common question so if Obergefell is overturned don't we have the respect for Marriage Act yes but it does not provide the same Protection that Obergefell does it does not require states to issue same sex marriage licenses and the act actually expressly authorizes certain forms of discrimination against same sex couples let me explain so Obergefell requires states to issue same sex marriage licenses and in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health the opinion that overturned Roe v Wade the court's legal reasoning really called into question the legal reasoning behind Obergefell and one member of the court expressly called on the court to revisit Obergefell my last two videos explain this in detail so in response to that language in 2022 Congress passed the respect for Marriage Act which requires the federal government to recognize same sex marriages and it requires states to recognize not perform same sex marriages that were performed in a state where that's legal so what that means is that if Obergefell was overturned States could legally deny same sex marriage licenses and when you look at the demographics pre Obergefell we can estimate that at least half of US states would not perform same sex marriages you'd have to be privileged enough to travel to a state where it is legal and then once you get back the respect for Marriage Act requires your homophobic home state to recognize the marriage that you legally obtained in a state where it's legal yeah and there's a reason that this act had bipartisan support the act expressly authorizes discrimination against same sex couples in the public sphere so it says that non profit religious organizations can deny same sex couples under this act whether you're in a legal or a non legal state it can deny same sex couples the same goods accommodations and services that straight couples can benefit from so it expressly authorizes public discrimination so Obergefell is an incredibly important Protection and it is not like equally replaced by the respect for Marriage Act does all of this make sense let me know if you have questions in the comments
