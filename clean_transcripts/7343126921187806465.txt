and we have come further than that whereas men spend half an hour to two hours on unpaid labour we do need to question that because yes and I wanna talk about it most women can't afford to turn cooking into a content creation career Nora Smith actually is a trad wife because of course well it's a duck because otherwise it's framed as I exist as a vessel so I think it's great if you know I think women are jealous because we want wives IM Memorial globally that's absolutely fine stress and depression few reasons that I know that it's not just that she's cooking okay someone to run the household so that you can go and achieve your dreams women suffer from anxiety so I did that that means we have a choice to do that if we want to I don't mean you're lesbians and if cooking is something we wanna do with our time you've probably all heard of the barefoot and pregnant trope the third is that she does have traditional methods of cooking so this book domestic servitude we don't get to have that a lot of the time for us is besides the point a lot of the time um or say this is now expected to do paid work on top of that criticism around her and what she does you're just jealous okay and when you add the fact that women are the tagline is literally why women need wives and men need lives I mean wives and looking pretty well doing it a lot of women have been really critical of Nara and her brand for so many hours a day I truly am not and cooking in a traditional way is one of the key drivers behind gender based violence let her live so as with most social media The Wife Drought by Annabelle Crabbe talks about exactly that it leads to a lot of problems for women women want wives where the man just wants to get you barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen unpaid domestic labour is not glorified give a slightly more realistic idea of what that really looks like for them lower education for women and to provide things that men and children want of me and while the International Labour Organisation because we don't get to have wives and to this day indented servitude and take all the credit for it as a result of all of this unpaid labour on top of paid work and it's okay to critique the message that whether or not that's her intention because you know and while we all have individual choices around how we wanna spend our time while I completely support Nara Smith to live her life in whatever way she wants I think that feminist for a long time it's a fantasy and yeah so a lot of these women have been accused of being jealous of Nara it's actually something that they're expected to do it keeps us in a cycle of inequity 53% more than men do this is me at work and successfully so and that they slave over does provide for a tradwife brand all is not as it appeared probably in response to a lot of the conversation and just the some of it together which is fine but we also have responsibility to be mindful and responsible even if we don't pay for it women spend three to six hours a day on an average different people creating content silent cooking that sends to women it's a lot and it's affecting women's health they don't include unpaid work in that higher mortality rates for women so many hours a day and I actually have to say I agree content creators wanna actually show behind the scenes a little bit more stipulates that people should not exceed 48 hours of work a week all the research says that upholding traditional gender roles because if it looks like a duck and smells like a duck and they are never thanks for it and that is proven in research as is my rightful and dutiful place as woman to fulfill my reproductive potential we've come further than that and yes and your full potential and live your life in whichever way you want to most of her videos are my husband or my children wanted this I mean necessarily this is my job and I as women in our current society and it tastes like a duck none of this is a problem you know there's a few things firstly we're just critiquing the popular messages that are coming out there but not for the reason you think unpaid domestic labour she's working while she's making all this beautiful content the second is that she's silent most of the time and looking at the effects that they might have and it really reframe this issue around what women actually miss at home cause that is the brand and the image that she's putting out there and I'm happy for you we stand on the shoulders of giants you're just jealous and a tradwife message this is literally me working on people's perception of womanhood and people's perception of gender roles unless you're you got one this leads to and you know and while there's nothing inherently wrong with being in the kitchen so when we see but you can't ignore the gendered context that exists around that have been fighting for a world where domestic servitude isn't the norm women are still suffering from which makes it look so attractive and makes it look so romantic gendered inequity which is great and it's not expected of women 75% of unpaid work is still done by women of what messages we put out there and what we glorify to the next generation I'm Doctor Zoe and I have a PhD in digital feminist activism but also acknowledge that her content is playing very much into that fantasy just the way men have been doing for time you can look at change the story by our watch as a starting point for that and when I say that and they do that instead of going to school in a lot of countries and so these creators have a lot of wealth or a lot of help behind the scenes hi so the gorgeous Nara Aziza Smith has made a get to know me video
