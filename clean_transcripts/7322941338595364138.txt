This morning my toddler stumbled into my room and her first words were PB and J. So that's exactly what I got started on growing up. I loved having fresh bread. It was one of my favorite things. So I get it started by making a really simple sandwich bread with some yeast, water, salt, sugar, and flour. Kneaded that until a dough formed, and then let that dough rise for about two hours until it doubled in size. I started on my raspberry jam. I use some lemon monk fruit sweetener, but you can also use sugar and some cornstarch to thicken it. While that was going, I started on my peanut butter. I roasted all my peanuts in the oven and then ground them up with some sea salt until a paste formed. You can definitely add honey to this if you want to. I didn't today because the jelly would be quite sweet. So by this time, my brand was doubled in size. So I punched it to release all the air and then split it into rolled that out and then folded that over to fit in my loaf pans. I let that rest for another 30 minutes to about an hour until it looked like a decent size in my loaf pan, and then I popped that in the oven and it came out so perfectly brown, soft in the middle. I was so excited, I couldn't wait. So I definitely sliced it a little Too early. My daughter requested a mini PB and J. I cut the bread down and spread it with my peanut butter and jelly, cut it diagonally, and this was really good. She ended up having a few of them and wanted more.
