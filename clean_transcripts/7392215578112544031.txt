welcome to my Ted talk where we chat about why your coffee is probably making you sick first let me go on record and say I'm not a doctor or a scientist but these are all things I Learned the hardest did you know that coffee is really high in moulds specifically Ocratoxin a and it's regulated in other countries but not in the US it has a pretty long half life and can stay in your body for up to 35 days so if you're someone who drinks multiple cups of coffee a day your body is having a hard time eliminating the toxic why is this a problem is an ephrotoxin and can cause kidney disease and a whole other slew of problems that you're probably dealing with right now like chronic fatigue brain fog insomnia and GI issues if you're coffee addicts and dealing with any of these issues I highly recommend you talk to your doctor about running a mycytoxin test and switch to a mold free coffee because we are not giving it up
