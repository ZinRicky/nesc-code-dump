I know you're scared scared to start over from day one scared that the age gap might be too big scared that your kids might not get along or that they won't have any shared experiences these were all on my mind when I decided to have a third kid my older two were 5 and 6 and we were really starting back at the baby stage from day one and the thing that has really warmed my heart this entire time is how seamless our third child has fit into our family not only has our youngest grown to meet the big kids and play with them in their own spheres our older kids get down on his level too so they can share these beautiful playtime experiences honestly my oldest two are like twins and I was really worried about upsetting that dynamic but it is only brought them closer and I know family dynamics completely depend on the personalities of the kids that you get and there is absolutely no planning for that but I not only have had a wonderful time watching these three siblings get to know each other and love each other I have had a wonderful time as a parent getting to start over from day one because I am such a calmer more patient more educated parent than I was the first time around I've been through the toddler stage I know which typical behaviour I don't sweat the small stuff as much as I did the first time around our third gets the benefit of not just being looked after by two exhausted parents but two doting and energetic siblings as well can't imagine our life without our third child because this kid is surrounded by love he is definitely in the winter circle and I personally love the big age gap
