alright guys I tried one of the viral micro curling wands I've seen on TikTok and here's my experience I have very very straight hair so I was skeptical that this would even work for me but I was gonna try it anyway so I sectioned off my hair and then I took a pretty small pieces and wrapped them around this particular one gets really hot so I did not let it sit at all as soon as I was done wrapping I released it it gave me these super super tight bouncy curls and so I just kept doing it on my whole head I also film this in the kids playroom so that's why there are some toys in the background anyway I have very straight and fine hair but I have a lot of it so it took me a little while and then this is kind of what it looked like after I have never ever seen my hair anywhere close to this curly so it was honestly so unexpected I brushed it out and I know it looks super crazy here but hear me out I brush it out and then I got some hair oil ran it through my fingers and this is how it turned out and I really really really loved it I believe this one is 3 8 7 inch and this is the best price I have found for them so far here's my before and after go check them out
