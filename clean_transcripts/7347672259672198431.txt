I just find insecurity so boring I don't know if it's because I did work on myself and learn to love myself better or if it's cause I'm a Leo or it's because I'm burnt up from capitalism but like the world is on fire no one can afford to do anything we have two eight year old men running for president people can't afford groceries and you want me to care that I'm fat you want me to give a heck about my double chin that that's what I should be worried about you know maybe Jaden Smith was right we should be worried about the political and economic state of the world who has the time to be insecure we have such little time to ourselves and you want me to spend that time hating myself like hang out with your friend go make out with someone read a book literally doing anything is a better use of your time than sitting around looking in the mirror and hating the thing that you're seeing and no offense I'm tired of talking about it I'm so tired about hearing about everyone's insecurities you have one body you have one life don't waste it hating yourself it's exhausting and if that really is the thing that you wanna spend your time doing fine do it but don't make it everyone else's problem a and B for those of us who don't care don't try and make us care I'm happy with myself why would I bother anyone
