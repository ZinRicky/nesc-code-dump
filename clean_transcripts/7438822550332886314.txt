So it's November 18th, and again, I'm wearing, basically a summer outfit with a jacket on. Um, I left the house. It was 67 degrees right now in New York, and it's 60 degrees now that I'm coming home. But, like, I should not be this warm in November. Like, it's nice I don't have to pull up my winter wardrobe just yet, but, like, I don't know, I'm starting to worry.
