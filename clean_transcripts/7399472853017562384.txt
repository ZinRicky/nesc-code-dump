the next time I feel like parenting is hard I'm gonna remind myself how much harder it is parenting three children on the side of a mountain at 0 degrees while they're flying at speed on skis compared to that, the day to day is a walk in the fkn park it's day three in Queenstown and it's just occurred to me that the last time my children saw snow was six years ago it was 2018, I was pregnant with baby girl and the boys were six and four so olive has never encountered snow and the first thing she wanted to do was eat it, naturally we got all of our shit where it needed to be which was a workout within itself I was tired before we even began and for some reason I thought it would be a good idea if I taught the children how to ski myself despite the fact that I haven't skied in about 15 years Ok so I don't know if this is in my head or if it genuinely helped but I feel like it genuinely helped? anyway you know how I said I was keeping this trip a surprise from the kids well recently I dug out the rollerblades and the roller skates and I got the kids on them for a couple hours a week for the last few weeks and I could be wrong but I feel like it's kinda comparable to skiing I was definitely pleasantly surprised at how quickly they found their footing with the ski we practice for a while in the beginners meadow before taking them up the chairlift and doing a few big runs and little olive was just off like a rocket which was both impressive and deeply concerning every time somebody bailed I tried unsuccessfully to suppress a memory that I have of watching my brother break his leg on a mountain not too far from this one while he was lying there I fell through a hole in the ice and nearly got dragged away by an underground stream and he had the audacity to laugh my poor fkn parents, that must have been the day from hell no wonder they split up And that's a roundabout way of saying I was surprised at how much my inner child showed up today I parent her almost as much as my actual children I quietener her down with a mulled wine in a 65 degree sauna which was actually insane And because I literally devoured a court of thorns and roses Iâ€™m onto book two which I had to buy on the iPad cause I couldn't find it anywhere
