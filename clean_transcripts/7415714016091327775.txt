I always think we don't have a daily rhythm until I watch these vlogs and they realize we start everyday with poetry and read aloud for us it's a good way to ease into lessons it eases me into teacher mode and it's a good transition for the kids out of playtime into learning time because they spend their morning play independently while I give myself chance to wake up I am not a morning person and I do not wanna start our homeschool day before 10:00am I know if we started earlier I could be done by then but that's just not me and really it's not my kids either they wanna wake up and play and do their own thing not get started with school so the morning rhythm I didn't know we had is actually really important for our day but I'm curious what is the morning thing that you do that sets your day up for success and a better question what time do you start school in the morning
