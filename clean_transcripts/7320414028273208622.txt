truly truly I have never made a ton of money from social media I've made a little bit here and there I'm trying and exploring ways to make more but honestly this is why I post the social media I I truly believe in the universe I truly believe in energy and I truly feel that like you put good out and you're gonna get good back and all I really want is for no one to ever have to suffer and struggle the way that I did and I realized that all my struggling came because I just didn't understand what I was going through I was just talking to a friend earlier today like I didn't even understand the word autonomy I didn't understand that I was able to make choices in my life I thought well I'm a girl that's not what I do I'm supposed to have the babies and raise the babies and support the man and that's it and I don't know how to be happy I don't know that we're supposed to be I just like was so lost and confused and once I realized I just had a really shitty partner that was encouraging all these archaic gender roles that just oppress women and all I needed was to break free from that and then I'd be able to have the rich amazing relationships with my children that I had always so deeply desired and was wondering why I couldn't achieve and I'd be able to find true friends that like really supported me and were like fuckin homies like just fuckin good people that that are good and I would find the life and create the life that I had always dreamed about I didn't need to put everything in this man and I didn't need to stay because I had children with them if anything having children was more of a reason that I needed to leave so to you to every single one of you that follow me to anybody that this message gets to I am literally here to show you that you can do it to give you the encouragement to cheer you on I hope good comes to me I hope the universe I know that the universe sees my efforts and and and uh returns it to me abundantly I'm confident of that I'm here to just make sure that like as many women can know and sense their power and who they really are and um fucking step out of that and like own their shit own your life own it all like you you fucking matter and I'm just thank you for your kindness I'm so proud of you and everybody and I'm here for you
