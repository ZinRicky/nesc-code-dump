it's so disorienting to have to just keep going to work and undermine how traumatizing this is for so many women right now like there are so many women who are survivors of SA who knew that people wouldn't believe them and who frankly didn't want to talk about it anyways but maybe they found a safe space at a Planned Parenthood knowing that their spouse or their parents or whoever wouldn't find out they were believed and they were asked just what do you need right now who felt immense comfort the only comforting thing might have been knowing that at the bare minimum they would not have to carry his kid so many of us have lived that and are now reconciling like yeah I was right I wouldn't have been believed and even if I would have been believed literally nobody cares like they'll put him on the Supreme Court they'll put him in the highest office on the most powerful country on earth on a platform of defunding that Planned Parenthood that was my safe space and making sure that I would have to carry his kid that's the platform on a platform that calls us nasty murderers b***ches the enemy from within crazy feminist just like millions of people don't care and we just have to go to work and act like this is normal it's just a normal difference of opinion just normal election it's not it's not normal it's traumatizing and if you're struggling with this right now I want you to know that you are not alone I am with you and I see you
