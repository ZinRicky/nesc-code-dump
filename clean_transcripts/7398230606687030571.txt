I think when we talk about motherhood on this page it always ends up this conversation about personal identity I know for me I started TikTok because I needed an outlet I was a stay at home mom Covid started and like many of us we lost our lifeline to like our social networks but more than that being able to be on here and share my ideas has given me this identity outside of motherhood and what we don't talk about enough within these conversations of motherhood is how the identity of mother is not always enough and that's not a bad thing there are some women who will come be completely and totally fulfilled by their role as mother but then there's this like weird happenstance for a lot of us where we went from being whole individual people to this role of mother which comes with its entire different identity as far as we're talking within like the social structure and a lot of women either don't feel like they fit within that mould feel like they're failing at living up to the expectations of that identity or simply feel a sense of grief and loss over the identity and the person that they had built up until that point motherhood may fulfill you and you may get everything you need out of it but you also might not you might need a hobby or an outlet or groups of friends or all of the above or career and I think conversations about women and especially women's identities and how they interact with our society is the conversation we're having when we have this conversation about forced pregnancies or lack of choice or family values it's not that those things might not be fulfilling but they will not be all encompassingly fulfilling for everyone as I always say mothers are just women who happen to have kids and we come in all shapes and sizes
