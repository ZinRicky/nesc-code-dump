What if this life is the one that we begged for? What if my higher power let me come back so that I could see the mountains again? Be on the lake while the sun kissed me? Laugh with my friends until my stomach hurts. Get my heart broken over and over. Cry uncontrollably in the shower by myself. Flowers a thousand more times. Your beautiful song for the first time.
