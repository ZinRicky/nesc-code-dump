I've just painted this room for the sixth time which is a sentence I don't wish upon anybody and to be totally transparent I wish I could just come on here and show you how I nailed it first go and sometimes I do and this time I didn't anyway that's okay cause I'm gaslighting myself into believing that this is just a realistic renovation now we're up to the part that I'm confident that I'm good at I started by using my Karcher Sweepy Moppy Thingy on the floors it does have a proper name but I like Sweepy Moppy Thingy better that was just my preliminary clean before going in with my floor polisher and unlike the Sweepy Moppy Thingy I wouldn't consider this tool an ‘essential item’ it's great and all but I reckon I probably only use it twice a year in each room my steam cleaner however if you know me and you follow me you know she is the MVP like I use this thing all the fkn time I was gonna say I use this thing more than my vibrator but then I've realised that would be too rude but then I also just realised that I've gone ahead and said it so anyway. now before you come for me for using this thing on the word can we just use our common sense for a moment because I absolutely would not recommend holding this down for a prolonged period of time on your wood or on anyone's wood for that matter I also would only do this occasionally and if I was ever worried I would do an inconspicuous test patch first But using the right attachment and the right cloth In my experience it’s fine one thing I've never done before though is steam a fireplace and initially I was worried so I just did a bit and treated nightly but it actually turned out great so I'll definitely try that again when I'm done I wipe everything down with a fresh microfiber and when I was done I steamed my floors and again this is something I only do occasionally maybe once a month but it always makes them feel so fkn fresh now it's time to put the room back together and the end is almost in sight so come back to see it styled
