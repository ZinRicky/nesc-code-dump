It truly amazes me how many people are out running around running their mouth acting like they can take a pinch to the face One thing that you should understand about life/world if you can't take a punch to the face do not run your mouth look at me does it look like I could survive a blow to my face? no I Learned, I'm smart I learned to hold things in I grew up with a lot of sisters and an older sister who would literally beat me up to oblivion so I know I can't take a blow to the face I will run, I will just shut my mouth but more people need to understand if you can't take a blow to the face zip it just shhh you know what I mean?
