Ice cream is a super food if done correctly, and it's the sort of food that I will only make from scratch because it requires nutrient dense ingredients straight from the source. Three raw egg yolks from my backyard chicken raised on pasture, 3 cups of raw cream, and a touch of maple sugar and vanilla is all it takes and I whisk this up in just a few minutes. I carefully pour this into a frozen ice cream bowl that churns for about 20 minutes until the cream has turned into ice cream. It's delicious and soft at this point, but I want my husband to be able to enjoy it too, so I put it in the freezer to firm up while I make my chocolate chip cookie dough. I start by freshly milling my primitive, regeneratively grown wheat berries so I have a truly whole wheat flour, which lowers the glycemic load and rate at which carbohydrates are absorbed to a more gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream. This cookie dough is slightly sweetened with 4 tablespoons of low glycemic coconut sugar and I add a few good ingredient chocolate chunks that I first coarsely chop before kneading with my hands into the dough. Next, I make small little balls of cookie and line a baking sheet with unbleached Parchment paper so that I can first freeze the cookie dough. This prevents it from sticking when storing in the freezer. Finally, I remove my homemade vanilla Ice cream from the freezer and let it soften up for about 25 minutes before scooping into it. Homemade ice cream doesn't have gums, thickeners, and stabilizers, so this is an important step. The cookie dough is the final edition. This was literally my favorite ice cream growing up, so to be able to make it in a super food way for my family is truly a blessing. Oh, it's so mouth watering
