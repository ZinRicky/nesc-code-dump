women have had universal control over reproduction and who sexist men don't hate women sexist men are jealous of women this is a perfect example this clip he literally celebrates the end of Roe v because it means that now women are going to be just as powerless as men were in their ability to propagate life this is all about jealousy these men don't hate women they wanna be women secure men don't feel threatened by women's power their ability to propagate life they don't support laws that literally restrict everybody's privacy and the state's intrusion on their own medical decisions in order to like get back at women for like being able to give birth sexism makes you so fucking dumb you will never meet a man who is sexist and who's not deeply insecure it's so sad because it makes those men support laws that actually go against their own interests their own values I'll use like self determination all government like I can't think of something that's more of a nanny state which is a set of policies that men typically don't support than anti abortion laws then reversing Roe v Wade if you were mad about the government determining like the size of a Slurpee or not seeing that the anti abortion laws that you're supporting and helping them pass not like opening up a whole can of warrants about what the government can do and choose for you sexism makes you dumb jealousy clouds your judgement right as long as men are jealous of women not addressing their own insecurity about why that is not gonna be making the right choices for themselves the more we frame sexism for what it is which is jealousy of women better we're framing the conversation for men to heal from it
