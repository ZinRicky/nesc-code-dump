These markers from the TikTok shop. They are paint markers. My kids have spent their day, they painted all these little rocks. Look at this rock that they painted paper. Right now he's decorating a pumpkin. And they're amazing. It was. And you get a 24 pack, 48 colors because all of them are dual sided, so everyone has like two colors. These are amazing. They're acrylic paint, water based, quick dry, safe to use, and keep even an eight year old little boy calm and sitting down.
