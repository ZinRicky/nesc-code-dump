I'm spring cleaning my wardrobe because Uber and Red Cross Clothing Drive is back again and I've had a bunch of beautiful garments sitting unworn for about a year and I've loved wearing them but now it's time for somebody else too I started by sorting through and finding the best quality items before giving them a good wash and as I'm going through it I'm asking myself would I give this to a friend? and if the answer is yes then I know that it's perfect to donate because the better the quality the more the Red Cross can raise to support people in need the Red Cross shop will then use those funds to help support people facing hardship crisis or disaster And donating couldn't be easier if you're in Auckland Wellington or Christchurch on October 19th you can request a free Uber package pick up to your local Red Cross shop Simply package up your quality women's men's and children's clothing that's in good condition so maybe you haven't worn it in a year or two package it up in a bag or a box and request a pickup through the Uber app it's never been easier to donate from your doorstep and declutter at the same time
