my TikToks have clearly found the wrong side recently but I just wanna say something these type of comments will never ever ever affect me because I have always had a very strong and high level of self esteem and I have also always had a really strong moral compass I remember when I was I think 16 and I went to a music festival and there were guys with placards who were rating out of 10 all the girls that walked past and I knew at the time that that was wrong and that was like over 10 years ago I recognise at a really early age that men are always gonna do this and that I needed to create safeguards inside myself that would not to do with my physical appearance I recognise that I was gonna age and I knew that if I put all of my confidence and self esteem on how I looked that I would at some stage become very unhappy with myself I recognised that society was asking me to do that to put all of my energy and money into how I looks and that I would be rewarded as a woman for doing that and that that is a trap and I thought about that a lot when I was young like my late teens my early 20s I thought about that a lot and how to overcome that I decided to put a lot of therapy and energy into not becoming a woman who was completely attached to the way I look and needing that type of external validation especially from men in order to feel good about myself so I have been training for this for a long time and I luckily have a very strong sense of self worth and I also know that I'm hot like it's not a question it's not something that I'm gonna ever ask myself I know like I just know on a deep level and it's nothing you say is gonna change that it doesn't matter how outspoken I am and how much I annoy you and how much I say things that are gonna annoy you there's nothing that you can say to change my mind or these issues or to make me feel bad about myself fortunately I love myself and I have a wonderful partner and he absolutely adores me I have incredible friends who absolutely adore me I have amazing family who absolutely adore me there is nothing that you can say that's gonna be the mic drop moment you think it is and I know this won't stop trolls cause that's not how trolls work but I just want to put that out there it is not doing what you think it's doing
