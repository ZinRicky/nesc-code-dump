on these cold winter nights I honestly can't think of anything better than flaky roti and a flavoursome curry I actually spotted this recipe on the cover of the latest dish magazine and when I saw it I knew I needed to eat it immediately I started on my marinade by popping my chicken and with some Greek yoghurt lime juice gramme masala turmeric sea salt and ground white pepper I pop that in the fridge for a few hours and meanwhile got started on my roti I sifted 4 cups of plain white flour added a couple of knobs of cold butter added about a teaspoon and a half of salt drizzle of olive oil and a cup of boiling water give that a little mix and then added another half cup of boiling water once the dough was starting to come together I kneaded it on the bench for about 5 minutes before setting it aside to rest then I got started on my curry sauce in a hot wok I combined oil onion salt garlic ginger chillies and unroasted cashews Fried that off until it was fragrant then popped it in l my food processor with a little bit of water and mixed it until a paste came together and now we need to get started on the spices dry toast cardamom peppercorns cloves and seeds fenugreek seeds garam masala ground cumin and white pepper pop that into my mortar and pestle and then blasted it until it was a powder and it was about at this point where I realised that this recipe really is a labour of love melt together some oil and butter then pop in your curry sauce and fry that off for a few minutes before adding your marinated chicken stir in your spices and let that cook for a bit then I added a bit more natural Greek yoghurt some water and half a cup of cream mix that all together and then just let it simmer then I turned my attention back to my roti I rolled it into balls then rolled it out brushed it with melted butter and oil sprinkled it with flour and then folded it up and then folded it again once it was all rolled up then I kinda gently pulled it apart back into a circular shape and then I gave it one final shaping I popped that into a hot dry pan and then the plan here I think is just to keep it moving so I was spinning it and flipping it before brushing it with some oil and butter mix and flipping it some more I want it to cook and get golden brown but not burnt once all of the roti was cooked I plated up my curry and my rice and I pop some roti on the side topped it with fresh coriander and oh my goodness I wish you could smell my house this meal was so hearty, so flavoursome and yeah it took forever but it was worth it
