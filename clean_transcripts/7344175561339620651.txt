the women that are telling you the trad wife life is amazing are the little 22 year old 24 year old girls that just got in it themselves I am literally just trying to be dead ass honest being a trad wife really fucking sucks I did it for 10 years I got married when I was 26 I thought I knew everything oh my gosh it was the next days of life college was over everybody was moving on everybody else was getting engaged and getting married and getting jobs and moving away and I had the majorest FOMO of my life the guy that I had been dating for a couple of years was like hey do you wanna marry me and I was like um I guess so I remember calling like every woman in my family to be like hey how do you fucking know you're supposed to get married like I don't I don't I don't know what am I what am I supposed to do and they were like yeah great good job congrats you know I was like okay I guess this is what I'm supposed to do but it's it's not all that it's cracked up to be like think of yourself when you're 10 years old and then when you're 15 years old you really grow and change as a person then from 15 to twenty well when you get married at 25 at 35 you might be a different person you know just having children alone the gravity of that sometimes really falls on you and you see the world differently and you do start to change some of the ideals and morals that you had you're gonna see the world through a completely different lens so when you give up all of your autonomy to this other person and then start bringing other people into the world you may set yourself up to be in a real shitty spot and I'm saying that with 10 years experience and now five years removed from that experience I've got five years to look back and say man I really I really fucked up I should have stayed and I gotta tell you the desire that I only wish I left sooner I only fucking wish I could have like healed faster but fuck I feel like I did a good job it's so good luck
