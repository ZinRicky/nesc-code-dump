Anyone else feel like caffeine doesn't make you any more energized or awake? in fact it just makes you more aware of the fact of how tired you are like dang really wish I had some energy maybe I'll drink an energy drink or make myself a coffee that will solve all my problems, but nope! all it does is make me fixated on the fact of how tired I am Is that like normal or?
