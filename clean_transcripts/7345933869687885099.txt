I remember how overwhelmed I was picking a diaper brand when I had my kids, but codery quickly became my favourite brand to use. And now that they're older, we use the pants. So easy to just slip on. And they came out with a new version of it that has higher cut and improved Velcro, so it makes them even more comfortable and makes it easier for my babies to move around and nothing to be leaking. Changing toddlers is an Olympic sport, so with the pant it's so nice that you can do it standing up.
