We're moving again. We hopped on a flight to Connecticut to go house hunting for the next few days, and even though Texas was fun, it's just not where we wanna be long term. We want a slower life, being in a more quiet area, having more space, being able to get some chickens and start gardening. But also being closer to a bigger city for all the work that we do. And also being closer to Europe because my parents live out there. We've looked at six houses so far and have a favorite house. This one wasn't it. Even though lucky loved all the frogs that were on the property. Even though the view was stunning, this felt more like a vacation rental to us. So we decided to take a break and grab some lunch before heading over to the second house that we wanted to see. Since we're so picky with our houses, we knew we were gonna buy a house that we'd have to renovate anyways, so we're looking for a good layout, but also just that feeling of knowing that this is our home. House was so cute. I absolutely love the indoor pool. There was plenty of space to garden in the back and put in a basketball court since that's one of Lucky's priorities. I love a historical home. Even though I adored this house, we were just too tall to make this work. We have a few more houses to see. Before making our decision
