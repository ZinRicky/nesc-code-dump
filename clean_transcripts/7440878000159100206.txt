each year Thanksgiving gets a little bit easier I choose sides based on tradition being sure I also have mixed colors and flavor on the plate I'm bringing out the staples like fluffy mashed potatoes a vibrant Radicchio salad with seasonal favorites persimmon and pomegranate finished with toasted pine nuts feta chunks and a creamy vinaigrette plating is super important and should be done right before you're ready to eat so salad remains crisp and fresh stuffing is a must and I make it using a freshly milled sourdough einkorn boule and bake it with fragrant herb-y chicken stock the stuffing can be prepped a day or two before so you can save yourself time on day day just combine and bake an hour before you're ready to eat rainbow carrots glazed to perfection in an orange juice sauce with the pre boiled enhance cooking and decrease oven time
