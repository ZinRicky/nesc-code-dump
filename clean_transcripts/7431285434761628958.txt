Trump is putting on a performance of masculinity because he's not actually masculine I mean this is a guy who spends more time with his makeup artist than with it with his own advisers masculine men aren't um manipulated by people who give them compliments I mean at this point Donald Trump is putting side check men masculine men actually protect women they don't enact abortion bans that endanger women and so even based on Donald Trump's own definition of masculinity and if you want hyper masculinity of being a protector of women Donald Trump is failing at his own definition of it
