I've seen four separate videos a woman getting attacked in New York City today what is going on three of them were hit in the face one was thrown to the ground one was hit like with a bat and another was punched in the face and another this guy was gonna go punch her in the face and she sidestepped and got punched in the arm but like what the fuck is going on it is so terrifying to exist as a woman or not a man in this world cause we're constantly under the threat of violence and like this is why I am sorry do not care when men cry oh misandry because that stuff not real men are not experiencing violence because of misandry misogyny leads to violence against women constantly it literally leads to assault and in the worst case de@th and that is a constant pervasive fear that women have to walk through the world just the casual potential violence that they can experience at the hands of men whereas when a woman hits a man they literally just wanna be left alone by men I saw this post on Twitter and it's so succinct misandry isn't real because women don't wanna harm men in the same way that men consistently wanna harm us before you say not all men if the shoe doesn't fit don't wear it  like women have to live every single day with the threat of violence but when we bring up the fact that this violence is being done at the hands of men suddenly it's an issue because it's not all men four women I saw four women today in New York City alone might not be all men but it is more than enough for it to feel terrifying to exist as someone who isn't a man
