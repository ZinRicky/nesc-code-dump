men are the problem men men leave are men trash men or men it's because men are afraid of being called the problem but women are afraid men are gonna kill them if you're genuinely afraid of being called the problem you need to grow up and go into my comment section cause if you think that that's bad you should see what men say to me on a daily basis when I talk about the fact that women are being killed by their partners men in my comments say I hope you're next men in the comments tell me the most vile and disgusting hateful threatening violent things on a daily basis but you guys are scared of being told that you're the problem honestly like I'm embarrassed for you women have a higher pain tolerance than men and that is not just physical we have a higher emotional pain tolerance you guys can't handle anything complaining because women have a platform now women have a voice and they're finally speaking their truth and you can't handle it cause you were born into a world that says you're never gonna hear the truth of who you are and what you are you're just gonna be able to take take take and things have changed times have changed and you can keep taking but you will be held accountable well in his response which you should watch to the video brings up the famous Margaret Atwood quote which is men are afraid women will laugh at them women are afraid men will kill them trust me I get it it's tough hearing that you're the problem all the time and you know what it's uncomfortable it is I know that because I've also felt uncomfortable at being held accountable for the privileges that I possess and I've learnt how to sit in that discomfort and truly reflect on the ways that I'm privileged and the ways I can be better but I also know it's possible to do that and I don't see a lot of you trying listen to me when women voice our fears about men it is not with the purpose of making men into the enemy it is with the purpose of sharing our reality maybe instead of scrolling scrolling scrolling past in annoyance being that victim maybe step into your manhood think about are you actually a man are you actually an initiated man who can sit with what that means instead of feeling attacked and victimized maybe it's time to listen learn and reflect reflect on the truth of the matter reflect on why people are saying this about men if you're taking it personally why you take it personally it's not about you really it's not about you on a personal level is it or is it cause why are you taking personally cause here's the tea changing men's behaviour which is what needs to happen whether or not you see yourself as the man who needs to change or not changing men's behaviour it doesn't require defensiveness from you it requires empathy and understanding world where women feel safer is gonna be a world where men feel safer too
