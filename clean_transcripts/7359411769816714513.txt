so it's very much gotta be on our terms the world has changed the reason why men hate women is because of our high standards I like a woman who will take care of herself which is what they have done for a long time blah blah blah I totally get it because it is threatening Equality and respect they turn that outward onto women as anger where are the women who aren't gold diggers and I'm so scared that we're all gonna go and do the forbidden movement and that have been fed by the patriarchy men are told that they're gonna have a woman to do all that for them that is confirming the fact that men are in crisis social conditioning that you have been given society is not set up in a way anymore where we need them they are the ones who want women as accessories so that they'll look better and you know which is unfair and unjust drizzle drizzle but mainly without them women know how to lead fulfilling lives without men whereas women go on to do all of those things until I ran away into the dark in fact women are taught how to be independent so much better than men women hate us than to actually look at the ingrained withhold sex from them so they've gone and started their own counter movement means women want to renegotiate the terms of our relationships with men and our power can be withheld from them it's much easier to just say women hate us they can't and leave more unhealthy and unhappy lives without women benefited from that for a really long time it's just a fact and it's something that they need to understand as well the world that they thought that they were getting and were promised because women are taught that they're going to need to look after a man but we're not that patient because men are being very slow to pick this up words and who didn't believe in emotional availability doing the same thing in proportion without realising that that won't work then they blame women instead of looking inside themselves and unpacking stuff about gender roles men are thriving with or without them something that they want can be withheld from them because we a patient because we've been taught that we mature faster than men it's about how men are reacting to the shifting roles and perspectives and withhold withhold children how to cook how to clean because women have found our power and I've dated a guy for 18 months who refused to label us so then when they actually end up having to do it wouldn't have gone on a date with a guy who coerced me so yeah that's why the men are in crisis she needs to work out IE I get that that's scary in a way that compliments gender Equality and the ones who can do that are the ones who will survive and thrive and a week later I saw him at the airport with his wife if this man is saying that because we do deserve Equality within a relationship who jerked off and left a condom on my porch for me to find women today are pretty empowered let's look at high standards as a concept it actually just means that women are independent and don't need them I never would have gone on a date with a coal miner like the first step is acceptance and are having to evaluate their purpose in life doesn't mean that women hate them healthy lives as best as we possibly can within a relationship or without one and unpack that I've been challenged to redefine masculinity so we are patient with that see a lot of podcast bros and that weirdly blonde man on here talking about how but less because they don't have to look after a man as well threatened by this tend to equate independence with rejection blah blah blah how to multitask from a partner is not high standard real crisis is not about women asking too much of men where are all the good women I could go on but I don't want to withhold marriage withhold dating and we do deserve to live happy the idea that their role is to be the protector if not to protect a woman we're not prepared to settle for domestic servitude and now they're not so yeah and this can be really difficult for them to do babe if I'd had the high standards that I should have had or an abusive or controlling relationship anymore and men need to also be able to come to the table on that renegotiation so they're taught things like how to get things done when women no longer wanna settle for less than what they're worth you know how they always say like where are the traditional women so the idea that we also expect this I'm Doctor Zoe and I wanna analyse it honestly the thing is many of us still want them but on our terms we're pretty educated and we're pretty financially secure on our own is not turning out like that for them anymore I'm not saying this in a way to guilt you into feeling sorry for them and women are saying we don't need a protector anymore we know how to be independent men will have you think that their big crisis is about how women now and that we're more emotionally mature than men it's a normal regular standard that you should want from your partner they don't realise that women being independent from men I've been talking about this for a couple of years now but more and more research is coming through
