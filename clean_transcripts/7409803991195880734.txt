let's chat homeschool planning but first let me tell you something I do or actually don't do that a lot of people are not going to agree with I do not care if we finish our curriculum and I do not plan my year around it is just a tool and not the end all be offered now that that's out of the way I do plan two different ways first I take the whole year and the topics subjects and standards I wanna teach and figure out where that fits back the subject I teach all year like anatomy geography reading math and Bible and then topics are usually seasonally or with the holidays at the beginning of every year I'll briefly look over grade level standards to make sure I'm hitting all of those points but that is all I do for year long plan I don't look at how many lessons are in a curriculum to know how many I have to teach a week cause I truly do not care if I finish them or not but when it comes to weekly lesson plans I do go consecutively through our curriculum it helps me to follow a scope and sequence and know that my lessons are building on top of each other I use it as a guide to know what I'm going to teach next sometimes I use the lessons and activities from the book and other times I come up with my own ideas every week I plan for my perfect week it's everything I would like to do if our day went perfectly but that very rarely ever happens
