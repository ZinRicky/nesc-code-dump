Okay, you guys know that I moved, and the only thing I don't love is my kitchen is super teeny tiny. But look at this little space saver fruit basket. It just has these little hooks that go under your cabinet. I literally put them in with my own hand, and then you can keep your fruits and veggies off the counter and save space. I absolutely love it. It's linked here in the TikTok shop if you want one. It's really necessary for this teeny tiny kitchen that I have.
