around Christmas time I was getting really frustrated with my boyfriend and I asked all kinds of advice on here and I wanted to catch you up on that because so for Christmas time I hate Christmas time and I was like super Duper stressed and having a really shitty time in all of life and I have a boyfriend and I had invited him to to do this like Christmas trip with me and my kids and then I was like not really loving the way he was acting and then to be fair he was honest that he gets like seasonal depression so like as soon as it starts to get cold and snowy he kinda gets like mad and shitty and so I think a lot of things combined that we were just being bickery with each other like I bought these little makeups do y'all remember these little makeups and he kinda teased me about them and I was like super salty about it and then he had like made a couple comment or I don't know he had just done a couple things that like annoyed me I was like so what the fuck bare minimum I'm just supposed to be happy with bare minimum okay well tell me why Homeboy totally heard what I had to say apologized it wasn't like one concise conversation it was kind of like a dribble of conversations that we had a couple moments where I kind of expressed my feelings maybe stronger than I normally would we don't get into like screaming fights and it wasn't anything like that just like maybe not as like kind and sweet as I normally would communicate with him but we did kinda clear the air um he I think it was a great moment where we kind of like crossed another little bridge in our relationship like I kind of was able to let him know some things that were bothering me and then he um could see where at least where I was coming from and um yeah everything's better like it's weird to be in a relationship with another fully functioning thinking adult that cares about what I have to say and then like responds appropriately in a way that like respects my feelings and still honors him it's not like he disappears and just you know does whatever I want but you know he listens to me and then like adjusts accordingly so yeah I recently asked him if when I move if he'd wanna move in with us cause by the time I move we'll probably we will have been dating for like close to 2 ish years like getting close to the two year Mark so um and that's like I have feels like the natural progression I wouldn't get married but I would cohabitate and it feels like um a natural progression for where our relationship is at but we'll see I'm not moving for like another six months or so so if anybody was curious cause I don't wanna leave my besties hanging y'all showed up for me giving me all kinds of advice and I appreciate it and I actually appreciate that he didn't turn out to be like this toxic prick so yay for love
