and sometimes they do and sometimes they want to I shouldn't have mentioned it cause I could but I feel like cleaning is such a big part of being an adult I straightened up the lounge before getting and not see it as punishment or a chore my children make their own beds and I will continue to do so until I finally I don't know.. seven times a day? but also there is nothing better than hopping did the floors gave the bathroom a once over the kids have a screen time routine and I help out whenever I ask them to and I clean down the bench and now the house is reset ready to get messed up again technique for another few years and by chapter of my life In the joy and the reward and the dopamine of cleaning kick the bucket mainly so I can have my coffee and wake the fk up in peace I mean I've been following these steps every I generally run the dishwasher about twice a day single day for the last 12 years allow them a little bit in the morning I've been told in the past that I should make so this is what my typical morning cleaning routine looks like which is full of last night's dinner dishes so I'll keep you posted but I want my children to share we're a family of five and the kids are currently on school holidays that I want them to be kids and carefree for as long as they can they definitely have chores and they always talk about this for fkn hours and when TV time was over I start by emptying the dishwasher don't get me wrong obviously I won't know the results of this where it needs doing daily then I clean out the sink and wipe down all of the surfaces I did the rest of the common areas and then stacking it with the breakfast dishes into a bed that your mum made stuck into making everybody's bed and I find when they're home I cleaned my entire house yesterday but it turns out I'm in a chapter of my life
