what does a typical day in the life of a home school mom look like now I can't speak for all moms out there because we're all very different but this is what my typical day looks like I get up at 7 get my protein drink read my Bible and stay in bed my kids are allowed to come in and get me at 8:30 and not a minute but we all really like slow mornings so we all kinda do our own thing until about 10:00 Today's a week MAV has speech therapy at this time and sis and I usually just keep doing our own thing when he's done that's when our school day starts either 10 30 or 11 depending on the day I usually start with our read aloud and the kids get their pre lunch snack and then we jump into our lessons and no two days ever look the same some days we'll knock it all out an hour or two and other days it drags on and takes us or five hours to finish I really never know what kind of day it's gonna be until we get started sometimes lunch happens before lessons in the middle of lessons or at the end never really most of the day I just wing it my one rule is school has to be done before dad gets home other than that I do not care some days I get a lot of stuff around the house done other days I get nothing but that is just what life is like when your day is dictated by two tiny humans
