I'm struggling cause I painted my lounge and I didn't like what I did to it to be honest I think I fkd up and anyway it's fine it's just paint we can always repaint it so at the moment I'm tryna repaint it and I've just got halfway through repainting it I've been testing colours all morning and uh I'll just show you because the inside of my lounge looks like the inside of my brain there's a lot going on none of it good And it's a bit of a mess
