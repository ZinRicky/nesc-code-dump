I'm in the mood for pancakes this morning and my dad brought me flour from Germany, so now we make pancakes together. There is no recipe for this. I'll just take 2 eggs. Let's start with the eggs. I burned myself up here too, with my straightening iron this morning. Normally I would use n rod mixer, but I don't have one, so I use the mixer. Let's put a little milk in it. I don't have vanilla sugar, so I'll just take vanilla extract. I use spelt flour. That's how my dad used to do them when we were little. I think we'll start with that. This is the consistency we are looking for. Just warm up the pan and then I put some butter in it and then we put our dough in it. I did not succeed in the 1st pancake. We'll try right at the 2. This is now our 2. Try. People said yesterday, thanks dad. I always make applesauce on the pancake, but I also made n few days ago raspberry sauce, so I make the also still on it. This is what the whole thing looks like then. Sometimes I put powdered sugar on it, not today and this is how I make my German pancakes.
