it is almost 1:30 and we are just now getting started with our lessons today if that doesn't describe the kind of belief that it is I don't know what will but last week I worked on these and so I think for our math lesson today I'm just gonna pull one out and we're just gonna practice some math facts whatever I don't remember what I did that's how how I feel right now um these are subtraction no okay these are number bonds we have been practicing that so maybe but we have we have been working on fact families and this is writing fact family creations so I think this is the answer just here to give you a little dose of homeschool reality there are going to be a lot of days in your homeschool journey that feel very unproductive and there can be so many different reasons for this right now for us it's because we have a lot going on I'm juggling homeschooling with buying a house kids birthdays and a birthday party plus out of town family coming to visit so instead of being angry and frustrate myself for not doing it all well I'm trying to focus on the things we are doing that are bringing us joy even if they aren't all that productive
