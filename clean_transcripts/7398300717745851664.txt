our first full day in Queenstown and I couldn't work out if my fit was giving Apres Ski or David Bain Either way I didn't have time to fk around this morning cause we are trying to fit in as much as we possibly can while we're here and the aim of the fashion game is to wear as many garments as you possibly can cause it's like negative 3 degrees would you believe me if I told you I was wearing 8 9 if you count socks last time I was here the gondolas were old and rickety but now they're pretty fancy and it took us 450 metres or about 15 feet for my American friends up the side of a mountain and the view was breathtaking we came up here to do the luge but she was taking a mental health day or something and after an hour of waiting we decided just to settle for the virtual luge And try come back another day can anybody name an attraction that doesn't make you exit through the gift shop though? we headed back down the mountain and into the township in search of some lunch and part of my lunch came in liquid form because I'm currently completely obsessed with mulled wine Mark my words I'm gonna be trying to perfect this recipe and then it was time for our second activity of the day if you were following me a couple of years ago when I went to Queenstown with my mum some of these activities will look familiar We came down for a couple nights she was working I was tiki touring around by myself and being the mum that I am everything I did, all I could think was “the kids would love that” by kids I mean the three young ones and my husband one such activity was the jet boat I just found this to be so much fun and I knew that they would enjoy it as well it's a really thrilling experience as they take you up to 95 kilometres an hour over water that can be As shallow as 5 centimetres It’s also a great way to see all the scenery up close cause they take you up both the Shotover and the Kawarau rivers and when the guide goes like this You’d better hold on tight cause you're about to do a full spin at high speed I thought Mark was brave for holding his phone while we spun because I could never and there's no way you can escape this ride without leaving wet and fkn freezing it's great one thing about travelling with kids is a couple of activities really wears them out and to be honest I'm tired too so pizza on the floor it is
