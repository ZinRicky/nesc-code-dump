I decided to go ahead and buy this dress in a different color, have the pink and blue, and I love it, but I think I might like this one even more. Normally, I wear shapewear underneath dresses like this, but I'm not right now. You can tie it a bunch of different ways. So you could, like, untie these and do a criss cross thing. I've seen girls untie this and, like, tie up the. I think it's so pretty. It's very flattering, very, very comfy. I think it's perfect for, like, a summertime date night. At least that's where I've worn it.
