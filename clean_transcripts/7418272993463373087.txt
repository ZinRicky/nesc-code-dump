How is this air dry modeling clay different from that? Let me show you. First of all, the air dry modeling clay has, like, a foamy texture, so it is a lot easier to build with. And this is modeling clay. It is meant to build creations with and sit and dry. So the other one, when it dries, it all breaks apart. It is not meant to dry out and make creations, but this is so when it is finished, you have this beautiful creation and the pieces don't fall apart. It all blends together. And so it is a really great way for kids to make things and be able to keep them and play with them later.
