you know it's Shark Week and I love to do fun activities for my kids so let's make shark cupcakes let me start by saying I thought the kids and I were gonna do this together but they had no interest in actually baking the cupcakes they just wanted to eat them so I had to do the first couple things by myself but as a homeschool tip if your kids ever don't wanna do their math lessons cooking and baking are a great alternative side note the Watkins food coloring does not have artificial dyes and it's a great alternative if you want food coloring but it is not as vibrant I genuinely had Pinterest mom motivations for this and it did not work out the way I thought I ordered these icing bags and everything and thought they were gonna come out so good but honestly this was so much harder to use than I expected and I could not do it by myself I needed a little hands for assistance I don't know why this frosting was so runny but I could not get it in this bag by the time Madison and I got it all in the bag it was all over us all over the floor and all over the kitchen counter of course she did not mind at all she was going to town licking her fingers but I have a huge mess to clean up in the kitchen if you haven't guessed I do not spend a lot of time in the kitchen I am not a baker I don't do the cooking so this is new territory for me but now for the fun part the kids did wanna put the frosting on the cupcakes and this is the moment when they realised I got them shark picks for their shark cupcakes and all is right in the world
