while the leo skepi video sucked I will say the situation is kind of been amazing? just because the sheer amount of people I have seen speaking out in support of like plus size people someone who's been talking about fat issues and fat politic for years I do think this is the first time I've seen this sheer amount of like people specifically non fat people like standing up in support of like fat people and like a doing it in a way that like it shows such a deep understanding of like the actual fat liberation movement you know it isn't really easy to feel like discouraged and upset but just because of like you know the the sheer amount of fat phobia that has been kind of circulating now online thin is in hero in chic ozempic recently there's just been so many anti fat conversations happening it has definitely been like a very like jarring time to be a fat person and honestly just the way that I've seen so many people like come out and say something has been so touching and encouraging to see and so I just wanna say like thank you thank you to everyone who like spoke out and kind of reiterated the fact that that people do deserve kindness and decency and like to be treated like people talking about how liberation can often feel like I'm screaming at a brick wall and it's really felt like you know things have been going backwards for some time but to see this many people talk about it just prove that like we're not starting from scratch and impact has been made and like just because you know the trends may change that groundwork has been set and like the good decent people are like there and in our corner and I don't know it was just it really did I'm thank you again it made me very happy so thank you
