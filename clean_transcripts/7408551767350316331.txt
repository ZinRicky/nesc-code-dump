you know when you stay up all night because you have this thing due in the morning and you can go to bed until this thing is done but also you can't get yourself to do this thing so you're kind of just like wasting time procrastinating the entire night and then it's morning it's morning and the thing has to be like done and it's not done right so now you stayed up all night you haven't slept and you haven't done the thing that you're supposed to do right and then and then not only is that the case but also instead of just being like okay whatever the thing isn't done let me go let me do what I can right and be on time and not only that then you're also late so you stayed up all night you didn't finish things you're supposed to do and you procrastinate getting ready and you're late to the thing that you need to be at so does anyone else do that or is that just ADHD school hasn't even started and this is this is my reality I need to start taking my ADHD meds right now also why do I look this beautiful for 9:00am not having slept wish me luck
