look at how beautiful it is in Minnesota today um anyways so I will incorporate the term pregnant people because there are other people like non binary and trans people who also get pregnant like that's just a fact that's my dog Lily and so it's really important to me that when I'm speaking I'm being both accurate and inclusive I think some people can get upset or defensive about this terminology because they feel like pregnancy and childbirth is so innately tied to womanhood right and like we've been discriminated against where we we have died um from pregnancy and they don't wanna feel like that that reality is being taken away from them but I don't personally think that that's the case right like one I think people know that I think we're all clear that women do reproductive labor but we can't like just ignore facts because we want it to be our thing and they're just are non binary people and trans people who also get pregnant so that is why you will continue to hear me use that terminology sometimes on my page
