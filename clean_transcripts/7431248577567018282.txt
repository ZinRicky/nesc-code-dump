Let's make some cottage pie and let's talk through a few things I can do better next time. First I started with peeling and chopping my potatoes, and then I added water and salt and put them on the boil. Once fork tender, I drained them and then I added butter, sour cream, and milk. Here was my first mistake, as the potatoes ended up crumbly from not enough dairy. I should have used more sour cream, some cream cheese if I had any, and cream instead of milk. I set them aside while I browned my beef. I would have added onion if I had some. I added chopped carrots because I didn't have vegetable medley, and then I added a half cup of flour, but I needed a three quarter cup. Actually added a quart of homemade bone broth, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder and garlic powder, and salt and pepper. I poured the mixture into my 9 by 13, and then I added a quart of canned green beans at the end so they wouldn't get soggy. I then topped with my crumbly mashed potatoes, molding it together with my hands, and then I put it in the oven at 3:50 for 45 minutes. I did add a tray underneath to catch the mess of it spilled over, which it did. Overall it was really good, it just needs a few adjustments next time. Recipe in the caption.
