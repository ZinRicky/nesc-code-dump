this is probably a dead giveaway that I'm balls deep into my 30s but my baby broccoli are finally ready and I couldn't be more excited and that means broccoli is on the menu for the foreseeable but this herby blanched broccoli salad is so crunchy and so flavoursome it's pretty much a crime not to make it first slice your broccoli, stalks & all into bite size pieces submerge them in boiling water for two minutes then ice water for two minutes before draining and patting dry To this I'm adding some sliced bok choy spring onions coriander mint all from my garden thank you alongside carrots capsicum and cashews I wanna go light with the dressing to really hero the flavour of the broccoli Iâ€™m mixing soy sauce sesame oil rice wine vinegar peanut butter lemon juice and brown sugar Give it a whisk and then finish it off with a couple of tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds for an extra earthy flavour and then I think the trick is to massage the salad I could be wrong but I swear it scratches my brain and makes the veggies taste better I've laid down a bed of seasoned sushi rice and I'm topping that with some seared teriyaki chicken a little bit of extra salad dressing and some homemade toasted nori sheets this dinner was very demure, very mindful there was a good crunch left in that broccoli The kids even enjoyed it without complaint for a change
