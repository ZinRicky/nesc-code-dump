all choosing the bear this is because bears are predictable and will only really be violent if they perceive you as a threat this is because if you get mauled by a bear no one is gonna ask you what you are wearing or why you were there or if you were drunk I wish I could say the same for men we call upon our government our communities our society and every individual to take a stand and I thank you all for coming here today to do just that and I thank the men as well who came here today it's not a popular choice it's not popular in this country to do that it should be but it's not and we need them um to stand with us we need them to join this movement and this fight we need everyone to stand up on this issue and we need preventative measures not just reactive responses we demand policies and programmes that educate and reform that dismantle the structures that enable this violence Australia is actually doing some of the most groundbreaking research on men's violence against women and we are a leader in the world so we know what to do these people you've all have you've heard from today they are experts and their organisations know what to do
