they were looking at the research that has demonstrated that in this election young men are increasingly leaning right while young women are increasingly leaning left and how young men but not young women are gravitating towards religion and they were like oh why could this be like I'll give you a hint it rhymes with schmishogony then they interview a lot of these young men and women to learn more about like tell us about your politics what issues are important to you and they draw out that one of the key themes amongst these young men meanwhile the women were like I'm really worried about sexism I'm worried about the rhetoric I'm worried about them taking away my rights I'm worried about my health care and the episode treated these like these were two separate things they were like well the young women are really concerned about sexism and young men today just don't really know their place and their longing for traditional values since when have we rebranded misogyny as traditional values these young men were pretty blatantly like I want a woman to stay home like the good old days does no one know anything about history why women needed to be with men why all women were in the home why all of them were doing unpaid domestic labor I'm not at all knocking stay at home parents but they weren't saying we should have an economy where one of the parents can stay home they were all very specific about how that person should be a woman and how JD Vance and Trump are running this traditional values campaign that really values that it's like it it's just misogyny??? literally saying on the one hand we wanna force women to do reproductive labor against their will and also we're really longing for that time when all women were in the home
