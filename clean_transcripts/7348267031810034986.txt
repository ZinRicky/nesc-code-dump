I thought after a certain point it's like well there's no point in getting a divorce now like if there's no cheating if there's nothing crazy you're not gonna fucking uproot an entire family so I stayed in a really shitty marriage for 10 years because I was like so committed to these vows that I had made and I was like determined to make it work and I truly thought it was just a miscommunication error and if I could just get him to understand how deeply he was hurting me I was so confident he would stop the way he was doing we'd had four children one of them is disabled she's had four open heart surgeries we've been through so much together of course it's just a misunderstanding and finally one of my friends this was the woman that used to host the Bible study that I would go to and she kind of coached us in our young years as we were married she had been married for 17 years and she got a divorce and I was like what people do that after 10 15 so I thought after a certain point it's like well there's no point in getting a divorce but they had through two or three children together either way they were a fucking family 17 years married I was shocked and even when she explained it to me then I was like I super don't I don't get it like I just did not understand and I stayed married for a few more years after that and finally after 10 years I kept at the she always came to my mind and I was like you know what I don't I'm not gonna wait 17 I think 10 is enough and I made the decision and I changed my whole entire life I got a divorce I became a single mother to four children and I don't regret it one bit I only ever regret not doing it sooner and I'm so thankful there were women in my life that gave me that example and that's what I'm here for I just wanna give you that example there are women who leave there are women who decide like enough is enough this isn't 1934 so you're able to get a job you can get a fucking bank account you can get your own place I have a roommate like there's plenty of fucking ways to make it and to survive you don't need a man you don't need a spouse uh all the nasty comments that people make in my comments nobody says that shit to me in real life nobody really looks me in the fucking face and treats me that way or acts that way there's gonna be a lot more people in your corner than that so if you are on the fence or debating or you're like oh no I'm gonna hold it don't don't hold on a little bit longer don't stop hoping in the bolt in the fucking nothingness you know you know goddamn well the marriage is over and you're staying for the kids and all that's doing is setting a horrible example for them so I am that example for you you you can leave you can make it and you can be way happier than you are right now
