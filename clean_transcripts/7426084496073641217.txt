the last time I made pizza on the internet over 15 million people saw it for some reason and this particular recipe is totally unhinged but for quite a different reason and if you fkn hate it when people stray from the typical Margarita pizza then trigger warning look away now we've got family over celebrating yet another birthday cause it turns out we all forget to cross our legs between December and January and if you would like to not have a baby then take this as your reminder anyway I've got quite a few mouths to feed today so I made a monster of a dough set it aside to rest for a couple of hours and then punched it like it was Free couples counselling It was cathartic I portioned the dough so that the kids each had a mini pizza that they could make and decorate by themselves meanwhile I rolled out my dough gave it the forking of its life before popping it on a hot pizza stone just to sorta start the baking process cause I wanna make sure that that base is nice and crisp all the way through now this is not my controversial pizza recipe that one's coming next this one we're playing it safe with tomato paste tomatoes onions capsicum capers olives and harissa chicken smothered in mozzarella of course and this next one might raise some eyebrows but it's inspired by a famous pizza joint we used to frequent up north and it is delicious albeit a little strange Tandoori paste onion capsicum tandoori chicken avocado and pineapple all come together to create this fkn delicious abomination and I realise that the thought of this pizza is gonna keep a few people up at night and for that I'm sorry for our safe Mediterranean style I just topped it with a bit of fresh basil and sliced it up and yeah that tandoori chicken ones H O T T O G O Slice it up and away we go don't yuck my yum but tell me would you try it?
