by now you've probably heard that the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the state of Arizona can enforce a total abortion ban that dates back to 1864 let me be clear Arizona Republicans want to force all pregnant women to non consensually carry their pregnancies to term at the risk of their own health and life by relying on a law that was enacted solely by men at a time when women could not vote or participate in government and the Arizona Supreme Court just gave them the green light to do so let's talk about how we got here in 1864 the Arizona Legislature enacted this total abortion ban and it was enacted largely because of William Jones who was a pedophile notorious for forcing children to marry him including a 12 14 and 15 year old girl who he then forced to bear his children so you can see why it was important to Jones and other men at the time to be able to legally control women's reproduction in 1971 Planned Parenthood sued the Arizona attorney general arguing that this abortion law was unconstitutional but then two years later in 1973 while this litigation is still going on the US Supreme Court decides Roe v Wade and makes abortion a constitutional right so in the middle of this litigation the Arizona courts like well the United States Supreme Court just said that abortion is a constitutional rate under Roe v Wade so yeah obviously now the Arizona law is clearly unconstitutional so the Arizona court says yep the 1864 law is clearly unconstitutional under Roe v Wade and they enact a permanent injunction just meaning hey nobody is allowed to enforce this 1864 law but then in 2022 the US Supreme Court overturns Roe v Wade in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health so then Arizona's attorney general the time Mark Brnovich goes to the Arizona court and he's like hey you should lift that permanent injunction because now Roe v Wade's overturned and I wanna start enforcing that 1864 law Planned Parenthood opposes Mark's motion on a number of legal grounds and that litigation went on for nearly two years until last week when the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the 1864 law can go into effect meaning that over 3 million women in Arizona will have no choice over their pregnancies because of a law that was enacted over 160 years ago solely by men and who kidnapped and tortured us now the law provides an exception for when a woman's life is in danger and I put exceptions in ear quotes because these exceptions aren't real there is litigation going on throughout the country because people including physicians have no idea when a woman is sick enough to avail herself of one of these exceptions the Legislature hasn't enacted some type of standard saying this is when you can intervene and even if they tried to it's impossible every person's pregnancy and health and situation is different there's no workable standard for everyone ruling will also have a devastating impact on reproductive refugees because now New Mexico and California are the only southern states on the border that have access to abortion so not only can people no longer flee to Arizona but we also have women fleeing out of Arizona now and it's incredibly difficult for states like New Mexico and California to continue absorbing all of these reproductive refugees from anti choice locations while also caring for their own citizens okay let's pause there did this help you understand what's going on in Arizona um let me know your questions your comments and please donate to your local abortion fund
