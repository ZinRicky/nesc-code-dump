Do you guys know that one famous quote from Joe Rogan that goes “be the hero of your own story” He goes on to say that you should live your life like you're the hero in your own movie you need to decide not to be a loser in your life you need to pretend that there's a filming crew following you around, analyse your own behaviour and do what you have to do, so your kids one day can look back at your movie and say wow, I'm proud of my parents. basically what he's saying is everyone loves a success story, but even more than a success story, everyone loves a story where people hit rock bottom and then climb up after even if you hit rock bottom, the important thing is how you come out of it He explains the way to succeed after you've hit rock bottom, is to write down your goals and aspiration, and think that you're the own hero in your movie. write down what you have to do and do it I just love Joe Rogan's message here because it's true you should be living your life like you're the hero in your own movie, start taking charge, you're in control, choose to not be a loser in your own life, be the hero in your movie.
