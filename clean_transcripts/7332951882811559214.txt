Since I split custody, and there's times where my kids are gone for days at a time, I like to just head over to my boyfriend's house and get some of my work done and just do some stuff over there. And this bag I got from the TikTok shop has made my life going back and forth so much easier. I used to pack, like, three or four backpacks and literally look like I was moving in. But now I can really, absolutely pack multiple outfits for multiple days. I can fit, um, gym clothes, extra shoes, my big ass sweater so that I stay warm. I still have room to put all my little extra trinkets and things in my hair product. This bag has been a true lifesaver. I absolutely love it. It's on sale right now on the TikTok shop, and it's linked right here if you wanna get one.
