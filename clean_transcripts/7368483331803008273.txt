so that women are expected to just deal with it and move on like you can always look back with retrospect and go yeah you're a woman of course it's gonna happen rather than looking at his choices what we can do in this unsafe world it's a normal part of being a woman because we're so conditioned to expect it that we don't report it that's crazy that is so shit that that happened to you all the time to try to keep ourselves safe everyone be like woah then it'll happen anyway because victim blaming is a form of social conditioning I'm so sorry so what can you do about it rather than what perpetrators can do to change their behaviour maybe I'll do something differently next time whereas if you were attacked by a bear by a man for refusing cause it does a lot of harm just say I'm so sorry that happened to you um a lot what it does is it normalises violence in our society that's all you have to say victim blaming culture and the point is is that this type of normalisation is a technique the reality is that for women well what did you do so this kind of comment questions her decision to trust or what they were wearing is not cause we don't wanna do anything to keep ourselves safe it happens during the night how women can keep ourselves safe it's because we already do so much to keep ourselves safe we know that it's really common and we know that it often harms the survivor this type of thing happens it happens in our homes it happens in our cars don't ask them to justify why they were there or why they think it happened it happens if we're wearing lots of clothes or if we're wearing no clothes to exist and stay safe you know what with him so I'm Doctor Zoe and I wanna talk about victim blaming it happens whether we know them or not rather than on the perpetrator to not make people as unsafe get over it you're a woman because it's like I don't know where we're constantly doing all these things and of course the reason why this is frustrating support survivors by calling it out used to silence women which is why we're kind of sick of it always being like don't ask for more details so then we end up doing this thing called safety work it happens during the day so victim blaming is when the earnus of the harm caused is placed on the victim from what we can continue to always do better to keep ourselves safe rather than his decision to exploit that trust God or how marginalised folks can keep themselves safe which is why we argue against it it happens in the middle of nowhere happens in bars it happens in public spaces explaining how she was left in the middle of nowhere and it also lets the perpetrator walk free off the hook will be quite consumed with trying to understand it happens all the time no matter what we do and it still doesn't work cause the weight of the conversation is consistently put on what else could you expect you didn't deserve that I believe you and how we can prevent people from making those choices again it always used to happen to me growing up when a victim or a survivor shares their story with you I wouldn't have done that again what should have you done differently well if you hear victim blaming so this statement of victim blaming happened in response to a woman
