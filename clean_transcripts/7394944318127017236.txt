if you know me you know my new old house is full of a few abandoned spaces so this is my downstairs hallway but I kinda like to think of her a bit like weird Barbie like she's all good she's just got a few funny things going on and could potentially look a bit better do you know what I mean I think my main issue is that there's a window in a solid block wall inside the house and that whole concrete wall used to be the exterior of the house before this extension was built about 60 years ago so the concrete block was just painted over but it still had vents going under the house so as you can imagine she's giving cold damp and dingy not to mention dark cause there's only one light for this whole hallway so the first thing we did and by we I mean my husband because I wasn't much help at all at this point was to tear down all of the previous drywall which we call GIB here the sparkies came to prewire before mark insulated and put up some new Sheetrock sheetrock? drywall? GIB? how many words do we need to essentially describe walls we put new walls up okay and then it was time for the old window to come out it was a bit of a hairy task I won't lie because that glass was so old and so brittle and then you're gonna have to bear with me a little bit here cause I don't know exactly what he's doing but I'm pretty sure it's the most he's doing the most, bless him ðŸ’• I think he's cut some framing timber and some battens and he's fixing it to the concrete but in between the concrete and the wood he's got some DPC or something something so that the wood and the concrete don't touch and now he's popping up some more GIB and just like that weird window be gone and then he stopped it all and then he sanded it all and where am I you might ask I don't know just swanning about somewhere but I think thatâ€™s the thing when you're trying to renovate and look after three kids cause there's always so many jobs to be done and we can't always be in the same place at the same just the way I like it I'm kidding mostly Anyway then it was time for the tongue & groove panelling to go up and if you've seen any of our other renovation projects you'll recognise that this is consistent right throughout our house it's not gonna be in every room but it is gonna be cohesive throughout if that makes sense then it was time to prime and paint and painting is one area I excel in so come back for the update
