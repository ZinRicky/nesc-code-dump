a few weeks ago I posted a video talking about how I was so thankful that I don't have to wear a Jean skirt when I play sports anymore and the comments were absolutely bizarre so many people related to what I had to say and then others were very offended something that I talk about a lot on my page is how much my life has drastically changed since I left legalism and have built a real relationship with Jesus if you were up in legalism a high control group or maybe even a cult I'm sure you can relate your perspective on life when you're in something like that is just so small your world is so small you've been taught to believe a certain set of beliefs and that's it and you're expected to follow those beliefs or standards without question for me it's been a lot of asking myself okay is this what scripture teaches or is this what I was taught to believe by man I want to honour and please the Lord in everything that I do not because a man told me to but because that's what actually glorifies the Lord this affects every area of my life including my job my marriage my friendships all of my relationship and yes even the clothes that I wear if you're working through something similar or you can relate to this at all I just want to encourage you that you're not alone you're not crazy give yourself time give yourself Grace god is good you can walk out of this and still have a great relationship with Jesus
