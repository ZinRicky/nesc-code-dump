so I'm going to the Print Fresh Holiday preview event tonight in Charleston and I am doing my makeup insanely early because I have to do about three rounds of kid pick up and drop offs before I can get dressed and go so I need my makeup to last and look perfect by 5:00 and it's only mmm one so I started with my primer and the Hollywood filter from Charlotte Tilbury and the best long lasting foundation honestly is this it is Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation I'm literally just gonna dot that all over my face and then blend it out if you haven't yet seen the girl on TikTok who does makeup tutorials who tells people that if their makeup isn't turning out the way they want it to it's cause they're not using enough I have to say I have used that theory for a very long time this is also a super full coverage foundation which is great because I got my lips done yesterday and I have a few little bruises and this is now day two of getting about three hours of sleep because of a kid who woke us up in the middle of the night alright contour ouch little bruising gonna bake my under eye a little bit I don't usually do this but I do need longevity and my under eyes are so tired today that they need a little bit of extra help so typically on a day like today when I'm feeling extremely exhausted and just not really ready to be out in public I would not be going to an event but Printfresh is such like a really cute pajama company and I love a good holiday pajama set so I really wanna see what they have I'm gonna go and then I'm gonna skedoodle my butt all the way back home hopefully get a good night sleep I wanna go really sparkly and holiday and cute on the eye and then really neutral on the lip because we don't need to draw any more attention to this whenever I want a lot of sparkle I go with these super shock shadows from Colourpop this one is in colour frog and I just put it on with my finger cause you can I really don't think you need a lot of brushes to do really good makeup I use maybe like three eyeshadow brushes and my fingers I'm actually only using one brush for this look tonight so you could even do one alright finish it off with this little like shimmery pink lipstick from Charlotte Tilbury called Icon Baby still have to get changed and do my hair but at least the makeup's done for the event and I'm gonna go shop at preschool pickup and a full beat
