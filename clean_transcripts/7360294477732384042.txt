I find some of the hardest moments in parenting are when me and my husband both have like 0% right now our 2 year old is in a huge mommy phase like I'm surprised he's not hysterically crying right now because for the last couple days slash weeks if I leave his physical immediate personal space he starts hysterically crying which is just very like physically and emotionally taxing and this morning is rough for both me and my husband apparently the big kids came in and woke him up at like two in the morning the baby woke up at 5 both of us feel like we're starting to get like some cold or some sickness because just a 2 year old's always sick and we're looking to each other to like fill that void we are depleted personally and individually and we're looking to each other to kind of fill up that that necessary extra energy that we just don't have to give but the problem is neither of us have it to give and I find these the hardest moments because no one's able to run at 100% right now and we're not gonna get the rest and we're not gonna get the alone time and we're not gonna get the personal space and some days are like that they're just like let's make it to the end of the day kinda days if you're in the trenches today I'm with you this is why they say the days are long and here's are short cause this day is gonna be 300 hours long
