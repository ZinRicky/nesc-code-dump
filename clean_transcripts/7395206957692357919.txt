do you have a morning routine or do things every morning that you just love my goal for July has been to establish a good morning routine and start by waking up early before my kids now I am not a morning person so 7:00am is about as early as I'm gonna get up for the last 24 days I have gone up at 7:00am drink a protein drink listen to my Bible app and now I don't know what else to do I've tried journaling but I'm just not awake enough to figure out my thoughts I've also tried meditating and it just does not work for so if you have a good morning habits that you love and think are so helpful please help me out
