what is the harm of inclusivity I often get people in my comments viscerally angry at the suggestion the mere suggestion that fat people should also be able to walk into a clothing store and buy clothes that fit them right like I what would it harm you as a thin person if you are someone who everything the entire fashion industry is catered to why would it harm you what effect would it have on you for an entire other group of people separate from you to also be allowed to spend their money how they want some people come online and talk about our experiences with that phobia and talk about what it's like to live in a fat body and ask for better treatment ask to be treated as equals to be treated as people to be to be seen as human beings right there are people that get like viscerally angry because they're like well you could just lose weight right okay like that is not the conversation we're having right now there are fat people that exist right now why are you treating these people badly because of the size of their body why does the size of their body bother you so much that you feel the need to be cruel like why are you getting upset at the mere suggestion of inclusivity I let me know please
