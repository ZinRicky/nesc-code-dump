ninety five percent of the time if a man looks good it's probably because his woman is dressing him I’m only saying this because my husband refuses to buy himself new clothes if he had it his way he'd probably be wearing the same clothes as he had when I first met him seven years ago if I quite literally don't put out his clothes for him he'll be wearing two mismatched socks with sandals a pair of shorts and a Hawaiian shirt I quite literally buy 100% of the clothes he wears From his boxers to his pants Golf attire, work out attire it's all me even his razors His shirts, his shoes, his belts his watches, sunglasses you name it it's because I got it for him He’ll try to argue with me saying “Oh I don't need these 50 dollar shirts or I don't need these 80 dollar pants” he'll say he already has these clothes blah blah blah Shh just listen to me and just try them on and guess what he loves them now He’s no longer wearing his college shirts that half of them he made into cutoffs I’m telling you, if a man looks good it's because of his woman
