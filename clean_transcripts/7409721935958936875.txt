the people who say that are telling on their own marriages and we need to talk about why first my credentials I have been with my husband for 12 years married for 11 we have three kids and despite how I look I am not a traditional submissive honor thy husband housewife so before I go forward don't think I'm coming from that sort of like godly woman background now the reason people warn people about having children when they get married is because having children does not fix a marriage I've never seen a marriage get better because they had children because having young kids especially and going through pregnancy and postpartum and all of the things that entails will highlight and enhance the compatibilities and incompatibilities that you have in your core relationship what I've Learned through 12 years of being together and 11 years of marriage is that a lot of people get married for a lot of different reason core compatibility isn't always the biggest reason there has to be such a huge foundation of like for you to make it through a long term marriage and I don't even consider myself having a long term marriage yet even though we've been together for over a decade now you see my husband still my best friend and favourite person on this planet male female family member doesn't matter he's my person and that is actually only gotten stronger since we've been together longer because over the 11 years that we've married in the 12 years we've been together we have dealt with death of pets we've dealt with issues with family members semi estrangements from family member illnesses postpartum anxiety and psychosis um great deal of anxiety through health issue three house moves two house renovations death of two pets me completely changing my aesthetic becoming a content creator putting our life online my husband building a business but the number one thing that has stressed our relationship has been parenting because the physical and psychological needs on you as a parent if you're going to be a good and present parent which I'm assuming you are wears at you over time you do not present as your best self when you're under those sorts of like physical stressors constantly instead of bringing you together a lot of times that will set you apart people will take their own time husbands will go off on boys trips and go golfing and girls will have their girls clubs and whatever and you will end up living these like separate but together existence is in order to survive the stressors of parenthood I post a lot of content about my marriage and about the love I have for my husband because it is the exception to the rule and that's something that I think is really important in this conversation is that although the people who tell you just wait until are basically telling on their own negative status and their own like negative feelings about marriage there is a reason why so many more people will relate to that sentiment that will relate to a story like mine because one in the white picket fence and wanting the kids and wanting this like picture perfect suburban whatever lifestyle that you think is the expectation of the next steps in life is not a guarantee of happiness but something that is a much more secure guarantee of happiness is your core compatibility and your communication styles with your partner and the level of like like and respect that you have for each other as human beings if you wanna see more content about equal partnership homeschooling parenting motherhood feminism style click follow because there's a lot more of us progressively happily married couples than you might think
