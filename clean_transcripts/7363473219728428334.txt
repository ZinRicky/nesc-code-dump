this is how we make fresh pickles every summer one of my kids favourite snacks first of all I'm gonna go out to the garden and pick some of my ripe ready to go cucumbers and I'm also gonna grab some fresh dill now I'm gonna take this into the kitchen and I'm gonna get some vinegar and water and boil that on the stove and add some salt I'm then gonna slice the cucumbers up into spears this is the favourite way the kids like to eat them and I'm gonna make sure they'll fit inside the jar then I'm gonna pack them in tightly just like how I would if I was going to can them see I can pretty much get no more in here and then you're good then I'm gonna pour that hot vinegar brine over the pickles sorry cucumbers they will be pickles and then I'm gonna put those in the fridge and after about a week they are pretty much pickled and ready to eat they're absolutely delicious and the kids love them
