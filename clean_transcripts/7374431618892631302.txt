bake with me as I make some food to bring to my very pregnant friend first thing I wanted to do is make some chicken pot pie this is just really freezer friendly the perfect thing to have postpartum a quick homemade meal that you can just pop into the oven and this is with a sourdough crust and then I made some granola this is not pregnancy related at all it's just really fun to gift and also delicious and I also got these cute bakery bags that I wanted to try as well so once it cooled I just added in some chocolate and coconut flakes it was so good and then I made two different kinds of muffins firstly some orange cranberry ones these were so fresh and delicious and then also a classic banana chocolate chip and walnut muffin this is with sourdough so it's fermented overnight and then lastly I made some nut butter snack balls I just thought this would be perfect for middle of the night breastfeeding sessions and then I just put everything into a cute little basket added some homemade labels and I also included these cute little baby overalls it just made me so happy and there you go that is my basket of goodies link below for all of the recipes and free labels
