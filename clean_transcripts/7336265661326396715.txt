there was some study done that said good parents are the ones who read the parenting books and like ask the questions and stuff and it wasn't because they read the books that they were good parents they just had that kind of mind that they cared enough to seek out the information you're seeking out the information is she gonna be okay is she is everything going you know you're giving her the space to release that pain in her childhood so it won't be carried on into adulthood it's not gonna turn into long lasting trauma it's just gonna be some shitty memories and her realizing who was who in her life so you you're good she's good you did the right thing but they're not gonna be traumatized and broken and fucked up forever because they have safe people to go to and talk to that care about them that are asking how can I support my kid and you're doing everything that you can so don't focus on the negative look at the positive see where you know the good shit is happening she is gonna be okay and I'm proud of you I'm here for you I love you
