if you've been waiting for a kitchen reveal this isn't it I'm sorry but I do owe you a kitchen update and I need your help so stick around till the end so this is where we started before we started pulling it apart if you want the full back story I'll link the video in the caption below but essentially we're just giving this kitchen a wee facelift the old bench got removed which I think my American friends called countertops? whatever you call them we didn't have them for two weeks which was a bit of a punish but two weeks came and went and In and went the new stone and the new sink which if you know me you know I'm very excited about In went the tap and I spent a good amount of time playing with my new hose hubby cut some drywall which we call GIB ready for the new tile and as of this moment right now this is where we're at I need to paint literally everything including the door which I painted the wrong shade of green ages ago and just never corrected and I mentioned in the previous video I was gonna show you how the sensor works on the new tap so there you go this is how it works I think it's pretty bloody cool actually I'm gonna put some cute brass handles everywhere and obviously we need to tile and this is where you come in I've narrowed it down to 3 options but I keep changing my mind cause a big part of me really does a clean white on white kitchen but then colour is so fun but also scary so I don't know, what would you choose? and I will give you the full rundown on the stone but that deserves its own video
