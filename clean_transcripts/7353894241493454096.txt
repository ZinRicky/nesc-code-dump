I'm just about to embark on a five day room renovation but before I do that I'm just gonna quickly embark on a boat called the Ranui I don't get to go out with my husband without the company of our three mutineers  very often and when we do get to go out it's usually not to do shit this cold so quick backstory but those guys that you can see hopping on the boat are the one and only Australian Brother sister duo Angus and Julia Stone and they're pretty fkn iconic if you ask me and pretty much everyone I know seriously though these guys are right up there with my favourite artists of all time anyway next month their new record Cape Forestier drops and to celebrate we're being treated to an intimate concert on a boat and I can't believe I just got to say that sentence out loud 🎶🎶🎶 🎶🎶🎶 🎶🎶🎶 🎶🎶🎶 And then we got to meet them And they were so nice And it turns out Julia loved cleaning as much as I do which made me literally forget my own name and I wish I was joking but no I'm just awkward like that
