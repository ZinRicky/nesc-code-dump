I was just getting ready for bed and I saw this comment so I wanna talk about it because I have been told this a lot first of all my page is my outlet I'm a stay at home mom or at least like was when I started doing this and I didn't get a lot of adult conversation I didn't get to use the old noggin a ton okay we were watching a lot of Peppa Pig and I got a whole ass degree from university and Socio Cultural Anthropology which is the study of society and culture so although you may not care about trends in society and culture I very much do so that's why I open my big mouth and I talk about it on here I am under the belief that our media and the things we consume and the trends that we participate in are very telling of our culture so when I see things becoming a trend I wanna know why and I start talking about it because I know from just like my itty bitty bachelor's degree that I never really use but we even had a basic level of anthropology knowledge everything has a reason and you could have scrolled too
