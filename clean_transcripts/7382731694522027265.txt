we bought this beautiful big sofa from Farmers recently and it is legitimately my dream couch it's called the Aspen and it's a modular sofa so you can get different pieces and configure it however you like and lately I've been on a bit of a mission to say the least to overhaul this space and today I'm adding some personality with some new cushions from Farmers and right off the lounge is my dining room and these shelves have just been crying out for attention so when I was at Farmers I picked up a few cute decor pieces to help tie it all together this is the room that we painted green if you caught that Reno so I've used that tone within the decor pieces because it tones really nicely with the mid-century wood Iâ€™m really happy with how the shelves came but my favourite find was the marble chess set because we're a big games family so I can just see us sit around after dinner and playing back in the lounge room it's time for the finishing touches and I can never resist a cute lamp for the ambiance and I'm starting to think that maybe this room might finally be done and if you've watched the progression of this room you will know what a momentous occasion that is it's feeling layered cosy and cohesive and the cushions really helped with that all of these items are Farmers brand M&Co and I just know that they're quality to love for years to come
