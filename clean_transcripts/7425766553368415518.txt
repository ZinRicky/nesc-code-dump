phew so a lot of you been asking me how I'm doing since the whole I didn't realize that there was some Wick and Dorito cult that well they're talking about this I'm in Arizona see the cactuses fighting for reproductive rights trying to talk to any person that I can to try and keep this country safe for all of us the right wing media ecosystem thrives on concocting fake scandals like this in order to keep their audiences engaged and enslamed so whether it's about feminist women or Haitian immigrants eating pets it's all meant to distract and divide us and these fabrications become real just because they keep talking about them there are forces who want to divide us and one of them is running for president a man who just threatened to use the military against US citizens to fight the enemy from within I don't see anybody in this country as Miami but the man running for president is banking on us doing that and I've now seen firsthand how the right wing machine fuels that division in order to help him we cannot afford to let them tear us apart women are dying from abortion bans people can afford their groceries because of price gouging and two hurricanes just decimated people's homes we need real solutions not division so let's take all of this energy and put it into the next two weeks I know this is a really close election okay I know that that feels very terrifying but here's why that's exciting every single little thing that you do matters okay it means that this is gonna come down to a few votes which means that if you can impact or influence one person's vote you are making a really big difference every single small thing that you do could be the tipping point that decides who gets the keys to the White House let's take all of this energy put it into talking to each other deep canvassing day canvassing the more we work together the less they can chip away at our future sorry I had to I had to do it I love you bye
