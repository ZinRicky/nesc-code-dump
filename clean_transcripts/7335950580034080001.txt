in goes the sushi rice balls coleslaw and those julienned carrot let's pack school lunches for an 11 year old so that the food doesn't fly everywhere once the chicken was done they were super easy to make actually it would be easier for them to make their little sushi creations I filled the mini thermoses up with some boiling hot water you might be wondering what sort of kid and in the lunch bag while that's cooking so that they could heat I made some seasoned sushi rice and rolled it into balls so I'm starting out by popping some free and then I fried it in the air fryer and fair question I was thinking about making a fruit salad and and I don't know if you've used one of these before I emptied the water out of the thermoses I need to quickly put some lids on all of these containers and nori sheets so that they can build their own little sushi rolls they're probably gonna be cold by the time the kids get to them and popped in a few of these fried rice sushi balls and gave them a really good dry before then I realised I didn't want to a yoghurt and seaweed which I made yesterday and then panko crumb but it kind of perfectly cuts it into little strips range chicken tenders in the air fryer and then I got started on assembling the side salad for them and that's the main part of their lunch done but the idea is that they're gonna have fried rice balls they're getting two hundreds and thousands biscuits I took it out of the air fryer we're going with a bit of a bento box kind of vibe today and a fruit string went in with my julienne peeler and this is just gonna be baby rocket but doesn't really matter which is kind of like a healthy ish gummy lolly I guess wants a salad and their lunch went a packet of chippies coated it in the egg and they're only gonna take a minute or two to heat up popping in some chicken strips I peeled a couple of baby carrots and then I which is an absolute childhood staple here in Aotearoa hot chicken salad a nine year old and a five year old For their treat portion figured if I cut it up and then I sliced up an apple I'm gonna get started on my produce
