The jacket, it's kind of like a shirt, kind of like a jacket. So you can layer it and put it underneath other stuff and be like, for triple warm and triple comfortable watch. And it looks like a three quarter pullover. Put this guy over top. See, now it just looks like my shirt. You can put my jacket on top, and if at any point it becomes too much, I can take this guy off and just have the shacket. It still has the pockets. I can also just be like, I'm hot, I'm ready to go. Like, it's a great layering piece.
