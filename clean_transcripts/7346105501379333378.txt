 I'm taking full advantage of Afterpay Day and I ordered on Afterpay Day so when I was ordering my top ups so I can set aside a few things before her birthday next month a little balm for my husband and then the rest of it is for mum and it happens twice a year Afterpay Day is actually a massive four day event so jump online or head in store installments to make it a bit more manageable I ended up choosing a couple of things for me and also so I could break the payments down into four it's my mumâ€™s birthday coming up and so I could save an extra 20% on The Beauty Chef website to score some savings Mum and I both love The Beauty Chef I decided to add a few extra things for her to cart
