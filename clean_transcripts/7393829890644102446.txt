I couldn't sleep last night and realized that I had a head of Napa cabbage in the fridge and hadn't made kimchi in a while. So I decided to go downstairs and do exactly that. I cut my cabbage into quarters and took the core out before slicing it into smaller pieces, repeated that with each quarter and put them in a large bowl, sprinkle them with salt, massage my cabbage, and then topped it with water. I put a plate on top to make it a little heavier and then let that sit for about two hours. After about two hours, I poured all that water out and rinsed it a couple times before letting it sit in my strainer while I prep my marinade. I grated some garlic, ginger, put that back in the bowl with some fish sauce, sprinkle of sugar, and some red chili flakes for giving that a good mix. While that was sitting and getting to know each other, I peeled my daikon radish and sliced it into matchsticks before moving on to cutting up some spring onions. Once all my prep was done, I put all of my vegetables into my large bowl, started mixing that really well, making sure to get everything coated evenly. I then started filling it into my jar. I had to try a little bit just to make sure it was perfect. Then I screwed the lid on and let it stand for four days at room temperature. To ferment
