it is coop day for my kids and they do an outdoor farm school this weather is less than ideal I know the teachers gonna keep them safe but I have seen like 10 lightning strikes I am panicking I am freaking out and honestly this is the type of weather that I would have lied and told them that it was canceled for the day but today is my daughter's birthday and she's so so excited to celebrate her birthday at farms with all our friends and give out popsicles and birthday invitations so I couldn't do it so I'm sitting here stressing can you hear that thunder I'm not okay
