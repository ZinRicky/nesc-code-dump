I have to go get my lady parts frozen I'm wearing this super soft stretchy comfy pants because I have a feeling I'm not gonna want anything touching my body after I'm taking my husband for emotional support because all of this is his fault not really but kind of 6 years ago yesterday I gave birth to my son and my cervix never heal properly which allowed abnormal cells to start growing on the outside so today I'm having the cells removed so they don't become cancerous and of course while I'm anxious and wedding in the waiting room my husband's gotta keep working he was absolutely no help in easing my anxiety but I made it through it took about 10 minutes and the procedure itself wasn't too terrible they used a type of hydrogen gas to freeze itself it's a cramping afterward that was not pleasant at all and then I had to be Passenger Princess on the way home which I do not like but when we got home my husband made me breakfast and now I'm gonna crawl up on the couch and watch a good show current pain two out of 10
