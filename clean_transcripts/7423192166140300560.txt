it's birthday season in my house because the majority of us were born approximately 40 weeks after New Year's which is suspicious but maybe not surprising and I'd love to know if this is a universal experience for mums but no matter how much planning I seem to do I always find myself up until about midnight the night before baking a fkn ridiculous cake and the night before Olive’s 6th birthday party was no exception because my little darling requested a “bright pink heart shaped glittery strawberry cake” which definitely is in my repertoire and definitely didn't leave me sweating I made a fluffy vanilla sponge before separating that out into two bowls and using a gel baby pink food colouring to colour one half then I layered the pink batter and the plain batter and kind of swirled it with a knife so hopefully we create a marble effect I made two cakes like this and drizzled them with a bit of simple syrup to help keep them moist before sandwiching them together with a buttercream and strawberry jam filling then I crumb coated it all painted my nails and called it a night the next morning I got started on a pink butter the cream and I know the hard way what that plastic guard thing is for for my mixer which I definitely should have been using and will be using moving forward layered all my pink frosting before smoothing it out with a hot dough scraper and I don't have a proper turntable but what I do have is good old Kiwi ingenuity so I just used a Lazy Susan that I keep my jars in in the pantry and a cake board and it worked out aces now I am far from proficient when it comes to cake decorating but what I lack in talent I make out for with enthusiasm I did a pretty average job on these rosettes if I'm honest but when your target audience is a bunch of 6 year old girls it doesn't really matter does it a good sprinkle of edible glitter will hide all sins and you can't convince me otherwise Olive chose the pink glitter when we were at the shop recently but then we decided it didn't really contrast well enough so we opted for a silver she requested fresh cut strawberries to top it all off and candles obviously now cowgirl Barbie is gonna take this cake down to the farm to have a party with all her little friends is it a bit garrish? absofuckinlutely but is she over the moon? I hope so cause I just about killed myself making it this is how the marbling turned out and it actually tasted pretty bloody good
