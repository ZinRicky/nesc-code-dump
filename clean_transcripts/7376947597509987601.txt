I need help from some of my northeast girls. I'm in the UK and everyone keeps calling me he's Lassie. And my partner reckons it's sexist cause he's like, it's like saying she's, you know, he's missus and he doesn't like that. But I think it's kinda cute. But that's because I've never seen that like he's Lassie. I think that's so cute that I'm just like, not sure if that's because I'm not from here. And the link though isn't really cutting cutting through. So for those North East girls, my feminist followers, get between the North East of England. What do you think? Tell me.
