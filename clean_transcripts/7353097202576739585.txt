he hates you they hate us men do not like us most men would see this and immediately dismiss it as hyperbole but what they should do instead is look at why it is true for women that they feel like men hate us this statement is emotionally true for many women we feel like men hate us and what that actually means is a whole bunch of things it means that many men do actually hate us it means that we feel that the patriarchy has set women up to fail we feel that the patriarchy is against us and we know that a lot of the time men don't love us they love what we do for them a lot of men have conditional attraction toward women because they don't respect us as humans they don't respect our whole personhood they only respect us as an extension of them IE what we or our relationship to them says about them men will simp after the respected admiration of other men um not the respect and admiration of women but being with women and having women um is something that men can do to gain respect and admiration from other men and women see this and women feel this and women know this conditional affection is the idea that basically women are there to be caregivers wives mothers um lovers we need to serve a particular role um for men what we do for men and if we neglect to do that or decide we don't wanna do that anymore or challenge that then we are no longer useful to men we are no longer serving our role as women to men so therefore they begin to hate us I'm sure many people would have had this experience in a relationship where it's all going really well with a man and he just adores you um because he sees you as a B and C and as the relationship progresses and you challenge some of those expectations or ideas that he's put on you about who you are and what your role is in relation to him he begins to literally hate you like you actually feel like he does not like you at all because you are no longer doing your you know pre conditioned role your prescribed role for him because he never loved you as a whole person um as a woman your person who doesn't matter your strip back um to the role of woman there's a concept called homo sociality I think I said that right and I touched on it before and it's the idea that men are actually just looking to secure um the respect of other men rather than from women so for men the pursuit of status amongst male relationships is more important than securing the affection or genuine respect from women so women's needs are then sidelined um in favour of any kind of um other male respect that they can gain men are looking to gain and reinforce their position within patriarchy they're not looking to gain the Equality or equity actual connection and um respect from women or in relationships with women if that makes sense so if you start being a difficult woman or a woman that doesn't give a man um that type of status that he craves um then you become non useful um to men and he will start to um resent so when we say men hate us that's kinda what we mean
