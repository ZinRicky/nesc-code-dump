living as a fat person means being told your entire life that everything will be okay once you lose weight you are living for that magical moment that you are finally thin to get the life that you want because we are told that that is the one barrier that keeps us from living the life and the experience that we want we are told our fat body is the only thing standing in our way of happiness and once we lose weight once we listen to them and we become smaller then everything will be okay the problem is that's not true in time and time again we see fat people do the work they lose the weight they're finally thin and they're still not at the place where they wanna be they're still not happy in the way that they want because losing weight is not going to fix any of the internal conflict that you have if you want to be content and happy in yourself weight loss is not going to be a solution it could definitely help but it's not gonna matter unless you do the internal work and deal with your issues with your body and yourself internally I spent years hating myself hating my life hating everything about myself and then I got to a point where I was like I can't do this anymore I can't hate myself just because I'm fat and because I did the work now I'm comfortable at any stage that my body exists in whether that be thin fat anywhere in between because I have done the work and I have combated the part inside of me that equates my body size to my worth I know that being thin is not going to fix my problems and the thing that sucks is like fat people are continuously continuously pushed on this idea that like all we have to do to be happy is to lose weight and then they do it they lose the weight and they're still not happy and it's just so difficult to watch they did what they were told to do and they had no one to tell them hey that's not gonna fix your problems you gotta learn to like yourself just how you are because when you truly like yourself it doesn't matter what size you are again do what you want with your body but I promise you losing weight is not gonna change anything unless you healed yourself you deserve love and kindness at whatever size your body is at and I am truly sorry if anyone has ever made you feel otherwise
