so going to see the Idina Menzel concert did not go according to plan um I'm getting ready for bed let's chat about it also I'm using this little red light therapy thing my sister made me buy we'll see if it does anything so our oldest has sensory issues sensory like processing issues she has a really tough time with clothes and always had this kinda feels nice um but last night you know in tightened moments of excitement it can really like rear its head and we had a bit of a like meltdown luckily like long story short we've dealt with this a lot as a family I've dealt with it with her for years now um so we got her to go it cause I think she would have regretted it for her entire life if she didn't make it Edina and all this for just like one of her favorite celebrities artists whatever so she did make it and like thank god and she had an amazing time she loved the show but during the show Idina Menzel was talking about her own issues with anxiety and panic attacks and it was just this beautiful moment where I looked at my daughter and she looked at me and she was like like you could see her face how exciting it was for her for someone that she admires so much to battle some of the same you know issues issues and struggles that she does as well it was just such a remarkable moment and I just I was so grateful in that moment for that experience after what we had just gone through to get to there because I think that's one of those things that she'll never forget it was so like affirming and confidence boosting you know kids especially young girls like look so much up to their idols right and when you see and again she was a potty mouth on stage she was making like funny jokes about her tits and stuff loved it um she's still a role model because of that moment because she could have been speaking directly to my nine year old telling her hey um it's okay that you have some struggles and anxiety um it's okay that you have these sensory processing meltdowns because I do too and look look at me right I will never forget that and I don't think my daughter will either
