tell me you have high functioning anxiety and perfectionist procrastination without telling me I'll go first cause painting my wardrobe wasn't on my bingo card for today or any day for that matter but I guess that's what happens when you allow an adult with undiagnosed ADHD Make her own life decisions but in my defence it did feel very important at the time so there’s that as you can see my room was - for lack of a better word - fkd And please excuse the fact that there's no sheets on the bed I'm currently washing them and in hindsight that's probably what set me off actually I think there's a few things that set me off firstly I'm going away next month and I have no idea what to pack and secondly the seasons are changing rapidly here in Aotearoa New Zealand and it suddenly gone from mild to colder than a witch's tit so I needed to do a stock take of sorts An inventory if you like which is another way of saying I needed to figure out what the hell I'm actually keeping in this cupboard and it turns out the cupboard itself was actually another contributing factor and I'm gonna go ahead and assume that you remember my last house and the beautiful walk-in robe that I used to have now I have a cupboard that reminds me of when I was a student and it also smells like when I was a student which means all of my winter clothes smell like absolute ass unfortunately but we're gonna deal with the clothes in a second cause right now I'm just wiping out the cupboard with bleach and that was about the time that I noticed that not only was it mouldy but also all of the wallpaper had these tiny holes in it Side note but one day I'm gonna rip this whole cupboard out and bust through this wall into the next room and turn it into a walk in robe slash ensuite but that day is not today today we're just gonna make it I don't know not disgusting? and then my husband walked in and saw the enormous mess that I've made and the fact that I was painting a cupboard and he was surprised but not surprised surprised do you know what I mean and fun fact well fun if you're anything like me but this paint actually has a mould killer in it so I'm telling myself it's gonna help me in the long run so while I was organising my clothes I made a few piles. I made a pile of summer stuff which I don't need to see until pie season is over and I've put them into another cupboard I made a pile of winter clothes which needed a bit of TLC and so I got started on approximately 75 loads of washing and yep I'm trimming a coat and I made a pile of things to sell slash donate once I successfully turned my entire house into a laundromat it was time to get started on visually merchandizing my shit and I'm a big fan of visually merchandizing your shit cause even though my cupboard is tiny doesn't mean she can't still be cute and I wanna open this door and feel like I'm stepping into a shop do you know what I mean this shop looks like it's just been the victim of a ram raid but we'll get there and by the end of the afternoon after a lot of interruptions everything was finally where it needed to be and I was putting fresh sheets on the bed called it a day, had a wee sleep and then this is how we pulled up this morning Can’t believe I'm showing you again but yep this is how we started and this is how we're looking now full disclosure I do still need to pop a couple of coats and jackets in here when they dry but there's plenty of room and now I actually know what I own, which is good I also sorted out my t shirts my singlets old jerseys and pants and I even have a whole spare drawer which is exciting and in this cupboard I've got tracksuits Pjs loungewear and some spare activewear but I'm super into my yoga at the moment and the hardest thing for me is actually finding my gear so I've dedicated a whole rack to all my favourite activewear so I can just get up in the morning choose an outfit and get to class
