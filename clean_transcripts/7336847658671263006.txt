there is an ozempic shortage because people are using it for weight loss rather than the medication that it actually is so people who get prescribed that medication and need it to live like myself and like this person's mother and so many other people are not able to actually get our medication because y'all are using it as a means to emaciate and starve yourself not a single one of you has any right to talk about my health or caring about fat people's health if you are actively taking medication that is necessary for me and other because you wanna lose a couple pounds I have not been able to get my medication in two months two months for the last three months I have been rationing a single box of medication and nobody cares because it's their right to lose weight first of all I'm not saying you can't lose do whatever you want with your body not my business what is my business is people using that medication so I cannot receive as someone who needs it for my health not just for weight loss but to control my sugar and deal with my PCOS my business is also how you treat fat people after you lose weight lose weight fine I do not care it becomes my business when you become fatphobic if you lose weight and then you mind your business and you're maybe even kind empathetic to people that have similar body types yours great but if you in turn start being fatphobic and cause harm to fat people that's my business also this is not a fun drug to be on there are so many disgusting horrible side effect if I didn't have to take it I wouldn't and I've been on this medication for literally over a year maybe two and I'm the same weight because I'm not taking it for weight loss  I'm taking it for medication
