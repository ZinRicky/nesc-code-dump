Someone came to my family's house and stole all of the nectarines from our tree. My dad has been growing these nectarines, and he's been so, so proud of my little Arab dad. He's, like, grew this from scratch. And there was, like, 200 nectarines on here. And someone walked into our house, came into. The gate, to be fair, is open, but came in and took every single one, even the unripe ones. What is wrong with you people
