when people want to make women feel small or to shut them up they will attack their looks because they believe that a woman's power is solely tied to her appearance now in some ways they're right because in the world we live in beauty absolutely is a currency of power but the funny thing is women are taught from a young age not to take ownership of that power I always think of that one direction song she don't know she's beautiful that's what makes her beautiful because we don't want women to feel or own their power a woman's beauty and her sexuality actually also should be given to her or bestowed upon her by the opinions of others a resource for someone else to yield after all a beautiful wife is a status symbol for her husband is it not sorry I'm rewatching Bridgerton so I really think that the most powerful thing a beautiful woman can do is know that she's beautiful because when your beauty is self defined it can stop being used as a weapon to be used against you because truly in an argument if somebody starts going after your looks they've already lost the point anyway and they're trying to make you feel less powerful so they can get the upper hand again after all someone else's opinion on your appearance doesn't matter
