I got the fleece line leggings from the TikTok shop I thought they were gonna be the thick I thought it was gonna be like that um teddy bear material like when it said fleece I thought it was gonna be super thick they're pretty thin when they say fleece they mean like it's fuzzy on the inside it's not like I thought these were gonna be like my fucking like ninja leggings for winter they're they actually are super thin and I wouldn't wear them like as pants really so just oh FYI
