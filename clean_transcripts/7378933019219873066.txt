remember when I got my first job as a graphic designer when I walked into the office it was uh I was in the art department for um a corporate hotel and it was a privately held corporate hotel so I was like literally would ride the elevator up to the corporate level um I don't know if you've ever heard of Westgate Resorts but um David Siegel like when you got out of the elevator David Siegel's office doors were right there and then I walked around the corner so I was like literally on the executive floor at this like bajillion dollar there's like documentaries about him it was it was fucking so overwhelmingly intimidating I was like oh my god I feel like I don't belong here like the imposter syndrome was so fucking strong then when I walked into the office that I had to work they were like oh here you go and there was like eight there was one two three four there was like six graphic designers our creative director had his office inside of our office there was like this like little glass fish bowl of his office inside of the creative department it was so overwhelming and then all the cubicles were open and the way you sat your computer was kind of in the corner and so anybody who walked up and down could see what you were working on so I was fucking mortified I was like I have to design I don't know I feel like it's it is such a private like I'm always so impressed at musicians or anybody who puts their art out there because you aren't putting a part of like your heart out there for people and you're like oh my god are they gonna like it like oh like what if they say something uglier oh my god what if it's not received well anyway I met one of my like best friends in life there we still are friends to this day her ex husband is actually being a total piece of shit right now and treating her like shit and there are just so many women in my life that have um supported me and encouraged me and honestly there are so many men in my life that have hurt me and disappointed me and let me down so um thank you for the support sorry to get all emotional but I've poured my heart and soul into everything so thank you
