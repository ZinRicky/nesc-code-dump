Logan finally got home last night for moving the barges at 1 a m so I am absolutely exhausted and I can't decide if that's like a good thing or a bad thing because the storm is supposed to hit us like overnight so either I'm gonna be like so tired tonight that I can sleep no problem or I'm just gonna be up get like no sleep for the next couple of days which is a very real possibility so today I'm focusing on drinking equal parts coffee and caffeine keep myself awake and hydrated today so as of now it's a little rainy and no wind yet so we'll see
