recently I Learned something new that I wanna share with you and that is the opposite of a patriarchy is a matriarchy that I already knew but in a patriarchy we center men that I also knew but in a matriarchy we don't center women we center children so when you see obviously conservative men talking about family values and putting the family first they're not really talking about putting the children first they're talking about putting first a family structure that centres men and doesn't that kind of make everything else make sense I thought so
