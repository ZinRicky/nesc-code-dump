There's a few things I can't live without, and the people that have stuck around know how much I adore hourglass. Lately, I've been using the Veil Hydrating Skin Tint. Super lightweight and immediately melts into my skin. Now these Vanish Airbrush Concealers are my holy grail. Don't ever go a day without them. Mix Sienna and flax, let them dry a little bit before blending them out. It's a full coverage concealer that still feels very lightweight. Then I finish it off with the Phantom Glossy Balm.
