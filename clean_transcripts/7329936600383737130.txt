please tell me if any other woman relates to this you meet a man and you know that you have a partner or you're uninterested you're not on the market you know your current situation but you meet a man and he is unaware of your situation and he is very excited to meet you and have a conversation with you and you're like oh I know you're only being nice to me cause you think you might have a chance to have sex with me and I know that there's no chance of that but you're really hopeful that there is and so you're trying to like pace their niceness for them because you're like I'm not gonna give you what you're looking for and I know that and I know what you're looking for just by the way you're talking to me so I'm gonna try to like walk you off that bridge by like as the conversations going so as to not lead you on because this is gonna get really awkward and then when they finally get to the part where they kinda like ask you for your number or ask you you know they they they do the thing and you're like oh you fucked around and now you have to find out and then immediately like all of their niceness and and happiness and cordialness like goes away and you're like uh huh yeah that's what I thought thanks ugh I hate those interactions
