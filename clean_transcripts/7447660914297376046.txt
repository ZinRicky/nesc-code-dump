okay I'm having a really bad like sensory processing day so let's get ready for a day at home with the kids where I feel like I don't wanna crawl out of my own skin I just got home from the gym and this is what I was wearing I could wear this but then I feel yucky so I'm gonna go take a shower and then we're gonna get changed okay I put on this cute comfy set I actually have this in three colors I love it because it's loose but it's very cute and once I add some accessories you can totally run errands in this I've done that before I also have some fuzzy socks on so I'm gonna add it's really cold today so I'm gonna add oh shoot I should do my makeup first I'm gonna do my makeup first and yes I will still do makeup on a day that I feel like shit because it just makes me feel better um but I'm gonna do like a light coverage like a CC cream and just kind of do this with my hands like aggressively almost run out of this this is the Fenty Beauty matchstick which I really like so do a little bit up there they're not really into see it cause of the hat a little concealer I always use Too Faced but just like a tiny bit just to cover dark circles in a little blemish here but not full beat a little goes a long way with this product too you don't wanna overdo it same thing goes for these liquid blushes from Rare Beauty they a little tiny dot goes a long way but I really love this color this is uh it's called hope ah we could all use some of that I'm do a little bit of a wing because it's just my thing alright hats back on and then it's amazing what like a pop of a lip color can do to make people think you've got your shit together surely she can't be having a mental breakdown she has red lipstick on now to serve a little extra count today I'm gonna add on this absolutely gorgeous necklace that I got for my birthday this year stunning right it's my first piece of like maybe not my first piece but that's one of the first pieces of real big girl jewelry that I bought myself which I was very proud of although I do usually need my husband help me get it on there we go isn't it just stunning it's that ombre Topaz I love it so yeah now I feel cozy and comfortable but I could still leave if I needed to run errands and getting ready does make me feel better motherfucker
