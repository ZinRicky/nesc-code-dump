so the math is mathing with this question I'm 32 I have three children they are 12 9 and 5 which means I had my first baby when I was 20 and it wasn't exactly part of the life plan it was a happy accident it was an unplanned miracle not gonna go so far as to say it was immaculate concession because that would be a lie but did you know that birth control is only like 98 99% effective there is a very very small chance that it doesn't work every time and I can attest to that so the story goes I was 19 in my first year of university and I went to my uncle's wedding and at my uncle's wedding was a wedding singer and I thought he was cute he thought I was cute we started hanging out and really really liked each other and after a pretty short period of time I was getting sick I was waking up sick I was throwing up in the mornings and I was like oh no I just have a tummy bag and his mum was like hmm sounds like she's pregnant maybe she should take a test and I was like I'm so not pregnant there is absolutely no way that I'm pregnant I'm so not pregnant I'm gonna prove to everyone how not pregnant I am by taking a test so went to the university nurse and I took a pregnancy test and I found out that I was pregnant and I was so surprised which now with my like actually fully developed frontal lobe I'm like you fkn idiot it was so obvious but anyway so I actually got pregnant when I was 19 but I didn't find out till I had just turned 20 and that was when I got sick and we were just madly in love loved each other loved the baby decided to go ahead with it and even get married so I think back at this and I'm like you were so naive and so young and just just full of hope and optimism for life and love and the world and all of the things but anyway that's what we did and we got married and we had our baby and we were super happy and two years later we had another baby so meanwhile I like I said was at university so I had done my first year I found out I was pregnant in my second year I finished my second year and then I took the third year off and just stayed at home with the baby and then I took my third year and I split it up over two years so by the end of the second year I had a toddler and I was breastfeeding a Newborn at my graduation which was pretty fkn epic now that I think about it now but at the time I was just super embarrassed because I was already a couple of years older than the rest of the kids in my graduating class and I was heavily pregnant and occasionally I would have to take my toddler to class with me and it just I got a lot of stares do you know what I mean but I was like whatever I'm here for a purpose I'm here to get my degree and I did I got the best grades and I worked really hard and I will just say that like nothing makes you work hard like being a mum you know what I mean like you can effectively use your time because you know how precious time is whereas before when I was at uni I was just sort of fkn around and finding out anyway so then I had two children 2 and under and it was a lot it was a lot I was like wow this is um so many kids and also we had no money because we were both students when we started our family and so we were just trying to work and earn and pay the bills and feed our children and clothe them and all of that sort of thing and then after about three years was like I want another baby and then anyway so I went and made one and that was when we got my daughter so there's a four year age gap between No. 2 and number three and that was it for me like family done so I had finished having babies by the time I was 27 and actually now that I'm in my 30s I struggle so much to think that my baby days are behind me because I am always so clucky I'm a very maternal person I absolutely love babies I love toddlers I love breastfeeding I love all of it and to think that like I'm still so young and that part of me is over but then also the flipside of that is I get to really enjoy spending time with the children that I do have and they are absolutely my best friends and because they're a bit older they're really easy to do cool shit with like shit that you can't do with small children anyway I'm getting a bit off topic now so that is roughly the story of how I got pregnant ha ha well actually there's another story of how I got pregnant but that is the story of how I became a mother at 20 if you have any questions lay them on me because I don't really know what you wanna know
