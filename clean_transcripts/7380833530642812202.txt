Always get questions on whether my natural hair is damaged since I've been straightening it for a year now. The answer is no. I always use the K18 leave in mask. I always make sure to work it through my hair. Let it sit for five minutes before brushing my hair. This mask helps me repair any damage, strengthens my hair, but also makes it super soft. I also love that I don't have to wash this out after blow drying my hair and straightening it. I go in with the hair repair oil. You only need a couple drops. You can use as a finishing oil or apply it on damp hair and it helps me reduce any frizz and add shine to my hair.
