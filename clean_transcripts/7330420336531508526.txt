Tonight, our family is hunkering down to spend some cozy time together at home, and I am partnering with Albertsons to make something really yummy for dinner. Come with me to Albertsons to pick up everything I need. Albertsons drive up and go makes it so quick for me to get everything I need without having to get myself or my kiddos out of the car. I am home, I have all my ingredients, and I'm ready to make some yummy dip. My husband is a huge sports fan, so that's what's on the docket tonight, but he's also a huge food fan, and I love how this recipe tastes so fresh and homemade. When I use good ingredients, the fresh corn makes a huge difference, and Albertson says all of my go to fresh and pantry staples. Now everything is ready to go for our closing night at home together.
