What is something that you would trust more around your body than a politician? A mosquito. Probably. A gynecologist named Chad. Ha, ha. And I'd take drowning over that. A dark hole. A YMCA lifeguard. A woman. Ha, ha, ha. A bear. J D. Vance with a couch. Free shark diving. Yes. Okay. Free shark diving. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You would take that over, like, JD vans in your business? Yes. Yeah. What about, like, wearing a wet bathing suit for the rest of your life and risking yeast infections forever? Oh, yeast infections. Yeah. Gummy bears, my grandma. Anybody sitting at that table.
