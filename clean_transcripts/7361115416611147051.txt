you can disagree with me but I just find it so weird the way that people exploit their children on the internet for views likes followers money whatever like I just watched a video of this like maybe 4 year old girl crying like that a million likes like a million likes and this girl I think she had a face paint stuck on her face could get it off whatever and like she's like crying right and I get that it's funny I just also like why why are you filming your child likely experiencing something that's like traumatic to them like obviously it's frivolous to you because you're an adult and you know logically yes this face paint will come off but this is a child who does not understand that this face paint will come off cause it's not coming off right now and she is like scared right and again I know it's a frivolous thing and I know it's funny as an adult but like I just I don't know like I remember growing up and being a child and being laughed at by adults when I was upset about something or whatever and like that never felt good right like I don't so I just don't understand what the point is of like making fun of your child and then not only doing that like posting it to the internet I get but you know I'm not I'm not a mother so maybe you guys have different feelings but it just I don't know makes me feel icky right like filming your child and posting to the internet is already weird to me I don't think that children's faces should be on the internet frankly cause there's a lot of freaks and weirdos on here but using like getting a video of your child crying for likes not for me sorry
