hey Ky here one of the co founders at feminist I'm coming with some crazy news our whole team can't access our account that reaches over 6 million people at feminist on Instagram right now it's been six days and we haven't had a single message from meta let's think about what happened over the weekend hmm a coincidence I don't know but it's heartbreaking not to be able to amplify the voices of different people who are fighting for liberation around the world share resources and inform our community on what's going on we were able to hack the system today I figured what if I could post from Facebook and to add Instagram to post well that actually worked so you'll find this little graphic most recent post on at Feminist's Instagram and you can tag at meta on it and support us to help us get our account back let's make noise and not let the patriarchy win
