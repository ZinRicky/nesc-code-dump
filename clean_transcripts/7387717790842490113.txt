okay listen no hate to this creator he can do a cover if he wants it's cute he did a nice job it's fine but why would something sound more 80s with a male vocal I wanna talk about it this statement has rub me up the wrong way someone in the comments said men are on a slippery slope with this type of thing and I'm gonna explain why they're on a slippery slope with doing this type of thing not covering something but saying it sounds even more 80s if it's a man making a statement like this is gender stereotyping it implicitly states that male vocal is something that the 80s is known for which says okay Madonna Whitney Houston Cindy Lauper don't count men male vocal specifically I think this is going for like a David Bowie style vocal which is basically just the reverb you put on anyway anyway is the sound of the 80s which really I mean says a few things that says either like maybe women weren't properly given the same opportunities are represented properly in that era or maybe they're not remembered properly from that era and maybe they don't count it's kinda like wiping them clean out of the history of it like I know I'm gonna be accused of over analyzing this cause this is just a cover and it's fine and it is but that's my job women are saying in the comments like I just don't feel right about this like it why why is this man doing this and I'm gonna explain why it doesn't feel right to you it's not a big deal and it's not that serious but I do wanna explain why it doesn't feel good you know I talk a lot about how male is neutral so male is neutral male is the Assumption male is the state the natural state which you know I don't believe but that's how you know society treats the male and then anything female is extra to that so the idea that a male vocal is 80s basically implies that there is only one certain correct historical representation of an era this is a very narrow and exclusionary um type of definition of musical authenticity cause that's what we're talking about here we're talking about oh it sounds the 80s that's authentic to the 80s that is only men are authentic to the 80s this reinforces a biased view of history his story Janet Jackson didn't know that the thing is like Chapel Road already sounds Cyndi Lauper already sounds Kate Bush we can't deny the historical significance of a woman like Chapel Road again a woman coming into the floor and making music that sounds like this I don't understand why we then have to make it male to be more authentic to the era to the era it references implying that male contributions to music are more legitimate or authentic reinforces patriarchal standards and norms and now to introduce the concept of cultural memory cultural memory is influenced by gender just the way that how we write or rewrite history is influenced by race class all sorts of things you know they always say the winners are the ones who write history right so it's the same type of concept cultural memory by saying that a male vocal is more 80s you are actually rewriting history with the male perspective with the male friends this type of selective memory really overlooks the diverse and very important um contributions that all sorts of people including women um made during a particular era so it distorts our understanding now and our memory of that era men can absolutely do covers of this song and I absolutely encourage it but I do think it's important to question the type of statements that assume that the man and the male voice literally in this case is the most authentic voice of a particular era but it's fine I wanna call it love even if you call it love I'm gonna love someone who calls me baby
