one little parenting guilt trip that really fucking grinds my gears the one where they're like oh one day you're gonna put your child down and never pick them back up and that one used to really fucking get to me I think you end up feeling really sad and falling for those things when you weren't able to fully enjoy your children's childhood why weren't you able to uh enjoy your children's childhood probably because you had a shitty partner that made it impossible to enjoy their childhood because a narcissist really controlling partner they don't want anybody else to have happiness or anybody else have fulfilling relationships they wanna be the centre of everybody's world so they're gonna make it impossible for you to love and enjoy your children so when you are staying for the kids and staying in those relationships that's gonna be the main relationship in your life you're not gonna have much time to focus on or enjoy your children so you're gonna feel really guilty about parenting and then you're gonna go through this cycle all the time really oh you should have held them more you should have been you don't have to wait until your child is grown to start to build a relationship with and enjoy them you can absolutely uh love your children now and make the memories you wanna make with them now and when you're in a loving relationship that's super easy when you're in a hard relationship it's gonna seem impossible and your heart will always ache for wanting these beautiful moments with your kids so you know I you know it doesn't matter that when you get divorced you're gonna split your custody fifty fifty because we're not going for quantity we're going for quality so same shit you only have 50% of their attention when you're living with their their other parent anyway so now you just get that 50% concentrated and it's all yours instead of feeling guilt and remorse over what could have been when your children were little maybe just enjoy them while they're little
