Trump is not manly Trump is not manly reason number one he is not a provider I mean remember those tax cuts they didn't help you or me but they helped his rich buddies while we were all struggling he was handing out cash to his billionaire friends like it was candy Trump is also not a protector he doesn't protect women he literally endangered us with his abortion bans and when it came to protecting us during a pandemic we just learnt that he literally gave covid test to Putin instead of protecting us he's also weak strong men do not need to compensate and put down other people to feel good about themselves strong men do not put down women or disabled people or Haitian immigrants in order to convince you to like them Donald Trump's levels of insecurity are astronomical so no Donald Trump is not masculine in fact he embodies the weakest version of it I mean I went to the streets and asked men to name one manly thing that Donald Trump has done and I got a lot of long silences and crickets even from men who were saying that they were gonna vote for him Kama Harris has bigger balls than Donald Trump
