I’m constantly amazed on how many people pass judgment on women who like to stay home take care of their kids, their husband and themselves who like to be feminine get judged so much simply because they like those things they wanna stay home today society has gone so far in the feminist realm that it is considered unthinkable to want a more traditional lifestyle or to be a little bit old school in the sense that you wanna stay home you like to cook you like to take care of the house and yourself everyone saying “you can be so much more than a mom” a wife you can girl boss you can climb that corporate ladder well we did and guess what we're tired of it we've girl bossed ourselves out and we're exhausted Some of us want to live a more traditional rooted life to be nothing wrong with that You may call us crazy but we want to be home we like to be feminine we like to cook, take care of the ones that we love We like supporting our husbands, supporting our marriage call us crazy And call us unhinged But there's nothing wrong with it and there will always be women who want to be in their feminine energy and enjoy staying home
