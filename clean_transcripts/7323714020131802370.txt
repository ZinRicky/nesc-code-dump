of giving me a little treat I did realise afterward that probably if I just opened up the fridge into a cleaning frenzy I did my fridge yesterday so not that much you know, doing the freezer.. all fkn day hosting my niece and nephew.. And for context and I like to think that’s the freezer’s way because we had some visitors which I call a pantry personality trait that I'm trying really hard with that job done but I ran out of time to do my freezer into this house before we started ripping into the renovation so come back for the update cleaning organising and decluttering my entire life and that's partly because this is an older house and we don't really have any good storage systems here cause when we moved into this house about 7 months ago and day whatever of me but I also have a goal to sort all of the so I'm starting this year off with some good I'm all for a good cleaning Marathon cause I've got the patience of a sinner so I'm gonna do it today systems and some clean cupboards sorting out my kitchen the first step was to take everything out don't get me wrong for cleaning her we've moved on now Aotearoa New Zealand and I've got three for the sake of my sanity I just won't stop until the job's done not a saint but I also need to make peace with just of my house by the end of this month that's actually a and spending enough good quality time with them I found some gin in there that I didn't know that I had staying on top of the general housework.. but this one said NOPE and I didn't really manage to establish welcome back to day 2 of me even if that takes me and even if that means all I can achieve in the day is just doing the freezer cupboards and drawers in the main area I'm happy with that I could have got it out but anyway including the containers but I'll never claim to have all of my shit together all at once to kind of quell this year and that's okay one thing about me is that when I get you know what I mean anyway many of the old systems that we had at our previous house and I need to make sure that I'm being a present mum it's time to move on to this shit show chips off the old block at home with me this is summer school holidays here in and cooking dinner for 9 people.. slowing down and chipping away at task we just kind of moved in and it's partly because I've been in survival mode keeping three tiny humans alive.. I don't know
