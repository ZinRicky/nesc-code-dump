this is my easy sushi recipe because it's birthday season in my house and the birthday boy requested it and on top of organising all his presents baking an elaborate cake and putting on a party for him and all his mates of course I also have time to source all of the right ingredients and prepare everybody's own personal favourite sushi and that's my story and I'm sticking to it and funnily enough it's also birthday season at St Pierres they're turning 40 and to celebrate they're giving away 40,000 pieces of sushi on October 1st from 11:00am and you don't even need to buy anything you can just roll on up and get some free sushi their key ingredients coming direct from Japan alongside locally sourced items such as the New Zealand King Salmon the food is phenomenal so get your free sushi pop it on a plate, hide the evidence and your family will be none the wiser
