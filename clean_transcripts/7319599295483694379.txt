how whenever they go into Sephora all they see is 8 to 13 year olds and boy do I have a story for y'all as a mom with a 9 year old and a love of fashion and beauty I wanna talk about this because TikTok is to the younger generation what like seventeen magazine was to us I think the hard thing is that these girls do not understand what an influencer is girls are far older than them that their target audience is not 9 10 11 12 13 that they're generally selling something at least marketing products to their peers a product marketing is not a new thing what has changed is how the parents are handling it now someone with a entering tween age daughter gotta tell you it comes down to boundaries and it comes down to conversations cause as little girls you're always gonna Wanna feel cool and older than you are and do what your friends are doing but keeping your kids healthy and safe has to extend to the trends that you allow them to participate things like accessing social media medical grade skincare these are things that can cause real harm down the road although I let my daughter dabble in some makeup rarely does it go out of the house and perfume which she's asked about is a hard no it's up to us to protect our kids because until they can drive themselves it is your choice what they're doing
