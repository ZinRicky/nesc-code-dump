I know this is a totally innocent comment and there's literally nothing against commenter however I don't like it when we talk about issues with like romantic love and the automatic response is oh you have to love yourself like self love is not going to replace romantic love it's not gonna replace the desire for that and you know the feelings that come with it so um I would just like I don't know I I I think a lot of people are struggling with dating and romance and having a crush like I think it's a very normal thing to do and I don't think that you have to just like learn to love yourself because I I do love myself that doesn't help with me being insane when I have a crush
