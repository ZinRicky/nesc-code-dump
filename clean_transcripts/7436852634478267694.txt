if you're having a third baby and you're older two or much older this is me telling you that it's gonna be okay it's gonna be more than okay I never would have thought that my youngest would catch up and be as close to his older siblings as he is and I know thirds get a bad rap but that third baby is gonna bring everyone together and your older kids are gonna become their best selves because they have somebody to look out for don't get me wrong three is a lot of kids but the love added is exponential and definitely makes it all worth it
