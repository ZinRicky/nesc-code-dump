He calls you a better baby mama because he is so fucking intimidated. That not only can you take care of yourself, you can take care of other people and do it well and do it gracefully. She is gonna call you a bitter baby mama because she doesn't have the same confidence as you. She can't make it on her own like you. She needs a man to survive and is mad at you that you don't. So when they call you a bitter baby mama, take that shit with pride. And know that it says way more the fuck about them than it says about you.
