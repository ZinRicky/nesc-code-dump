Yes, this is the point, though. Feminism got women in the door of being able to go to work, but the structure around the working day or the workplace never shifted to accommodate women entering the workforce, which is why we still have such, like, horrifically short maternity leave, why we have very few protections for pregnant women, why we don't have, like, child care in major offices. Like, the fact that workplaces are so unaccommodating still means that we have a lot of work to do.
