this little sailboat has been at the thrift shop for a while now it's only $3 so I decided to grab it and give it a makeover and turn it into this I started to paint all the small intricate pieces brown first so if I made a mistake it wasn't a big deal and then I moved on to the wooden part of the inside of the boat this part took a little bit because there's so much little spaces then I moved on to the base and I decided to do that brown too to make it look like wood I wanted to go with a muted white to look like canvas on the sails which I think was a good idea because it really brightens up the sailboat then I started on the bottom painted that white also but it's a different shade of white you can see it's a whiter white there was a little stripe on the boat and I decided to do that black and then add the initials FV for flipping vintage this is how it turned out let me know what you think in the comments
