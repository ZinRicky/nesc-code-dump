Men do not want a woman that “needs” them Men want a woman that *wants* them there's a huge difference there the woman who needs a man expects him to provide and pay for everything because she can't provide for herself These are the same woman who have no job no source of income and they try to flip the script on men and try to make them feel inadequate saying they need a man who can provide for both of them, off of one income when it's just unrealistic for one In this economy?! excuse me? they're like “I don't need a job, I need a man who makes enough money for the both of us” Are you hearing yourself right now? When a woman has her own money, has her own job then the man knows that she's not using him because she has nothing when you're broke you need a man to live, to survive She may not even love you she might just like what you can provide or what you do for her Stop trying to finesse men for their money A real woman doesn't need a man She doesn't need you She wants you
