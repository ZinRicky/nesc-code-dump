I get asked this all the time about this snuggly, delicious sweater. I'm not trying to sell you shit. I'm not making no fucking commission. I. When I am, I make it clearer than I am. I got this from a little Fucking Farm store website called Murdoch's. The thing is, it's such a tiny little store, their fucking online is never working. They have stores in, like, Colorado, Wyoming. I don't fucking know if you go to, like, Amazon or any place or just the fucking internet. Go to Google and search asymmetrical zipper cowbell neck sweater, and similar things will come up. Ha ha.
