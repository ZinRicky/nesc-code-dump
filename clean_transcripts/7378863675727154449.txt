I'm in Ireland. I arrived a few days ago. And ever since I arrived, I've noticed how the old country, they know how to stand up against genocide. It is ingrained. I went to people's house and they had Palestinian flags in their house. I went to this music festival and it was just everywhere. Look at these lights. Solidarity with Palestine, Free Palestine.
