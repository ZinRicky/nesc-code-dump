Talk a lot about boundaries within relationships on this app. And so people find it very surprising when they realize that I've only ever really had to walk away from a very small number of relationships, because I truly believe boundaries help you maintain relationships, not get rid of relationship. When I have had to walk away from somebody or relationship, it is always been because I have seen something in their character or in their motivations that is no longer compatible with the type of relationship I can have. It's not what they've done, it's who they are. Maybe there was an action or an incident that was a catalyst for this discovery, but the only time that I've actually had to walk fully away from a relationship with somebody is because I had realized that my happiness and health is not compatible with the form of toxicity that they bring to the table. I wish you well. I hope you have a great life, but I'm not gonna be part of it. I'm gonna be going that way, and I've never regretted it.
