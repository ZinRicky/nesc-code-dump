if you live in the area that has been affected by Hurricane you need one of these I never realized how much pollution and bacteria and all that went into the air after Hurricane until Hurricane had a dragon and I got so sick with cold toxicity and I had no idea that that was a thing that could happen and so one of the things that my doctor recommended was getting air air fires for our whole home because we can't control what the air quality is like outside but what we can control is what the quality of air is inside our home and air air fires are fantastic for that okay last year we have invested in air purifiers for every room in the house this one is for the homeschool room and I can rest easy knowing that the air we're breathing every day while we're schooling is nice and clean
