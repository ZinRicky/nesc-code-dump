as moms I think we have a really big problem with how we talk to ourselves because I constantly am telling myself that ugh I didn't get enough done today or ugh I was lazy like we didn't really do anything yesterday was the perfect example I told myself ugh man this was such a lazy day like we didn't do anything we were exhausted we laid around we watched a lot of Christmas movies then I actually took stock of what we actually got done we cooked an entire extra Thanksgiving dinner because we didn't have leftovers at our house and we wanted to make sure that we were gonna be able to make sandwiches because that's the best part of Thanksgiving we decorated two trees for Christmas unpacked from a trip where we left to go to Thanksgiving and did all of the necessary holiday shopping does that sound like nothing or does that sound like a pretty packed day before kids a day of doing nothing was a day of actually doing nothing of actually just like rotting on the couch all day and those were great but I don't really get those anymore I've got three kids but what I can do and what you should be doing too is being so much easier on yourself if you have a day where you feel kind of like you're being lazy or you're not getting stuff done you're not getting stuff accomplished please list in your head the things that you actually did because if you were a mother with children I can almost guarantee that it is more than you would ever do on your most accomplished day before kids stop speaking down to yourself you're doing a lot it's why you're so tired
