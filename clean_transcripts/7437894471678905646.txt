Love is never enough anyone with a brain and a pulse can fall in love with someone but that is never gonna sustain a relationship What will is connection safety, trust and communication You can love someone until you're blue in the face but that's not gonna be enough The better question to ask is Does your partner feel valued and respected? Do they feel like a priority in your life, Do you appreciate each other? Can you take accountability when you mess up? Can you repair conflicts and are you someone that they can be vulnerable around? Do you listen when they tell you what they need to feel valued? “HOW” you love each other is the biggest difference.
