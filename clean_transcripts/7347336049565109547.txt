opportunities away from their kids to grow in a game I just got home from the gym and I saw that video and I wanna weigh in as a family that does not prioritize sport because I think the original creator no hate to him whatsoever this is a really interesting conversation I think that creator thinks that parents that don't prioritize their kids sports or travel sports are doing so to prioritize themselves but in reality at least for my family I know that it's because we're prioritizing our family time and I know that we're the aberration in our area suburban America I see more families that prioritize multiple sports and taking their kids to and from activities than I see family sitting down for family dinner I also see more parents living vicariously through their children's athletic aptitude than I do otherwise daddy played football so Timmy's gotta play football and don't get me wrong you learn lots of great camaraderie teamwork perseverance determination through sports but you can also learn those other ways I think what our family is at least trying to do is find a balance between fostering our kids talents and interests and having a close bond as a family and I think travel sports can really put a diaper on that and don't get me wrong if I had a kid that was Wayne Gretzky and wanted to be on the ice 24 7 we would be a travel hockey family I remember reading a quote from Tom Brady I think it was who said nobody ever had to make him practice but the reality is I just don't think it's that big of a deal most kids who play wreck sports aren't gonna go on to the collegiate level or even the professional level it's all for fun and for fostering those skills that you get from a team sport activity but there's a balance and I know in our area there is not as much balance as I think there should be kids sports have become way too competitive and way too intense let the kids have fun sure absolutely pick a sport try all the sports we've tried like I think a thousand sports at this point but don't forget that free time and time with just their family to hang out go on vacation go camping have dinner at home those are also good things for kids too
