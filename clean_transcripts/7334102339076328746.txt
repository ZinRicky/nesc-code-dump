we don't hate Taylor Swift we hate the unabashed, idolatrous, cult-like worship of her that's what we hate that's what we are annoyed by she might be a fine person she might be a nice person I have absolutely no idea her music might be fine to some people there are a few songs that I like but none of us know her well enough to say if we hate her or love her or know her character or anything like come on but Taylor Swift is not the problem it's the people who say that they will vote for whoever she votes for it's you people it's the people putting Taylor Swift shirts on Jesus and literally worshipping this girl that they've never met that they don't know anything about they would do anything for her that is that is what's annoying that's what's weird and it's fine to think that. we don't know we can't hate her so when the Swifties are like “you guys hate her so much” like we don't hate her we don't know her well enough to hate her or to love her nobody hates her we hate the worship of her
