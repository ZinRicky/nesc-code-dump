the bullying is so bad it's so bad this is why we can't have nice things this is why more people aren't speaking up because y'all take someone supporting a cause to help children in a war torn country and you make it about not supporting kids on the other side of the border and I've gotten it too and I knew I would as soon as I started working for a crowdsourcing for Gofundme for a Palestinian family I knew people would say I didn't care about Israeli kids and the reality is maybe I'm just like a little bit naive but I've been very outspoken about being a Jewish woman having family in Israel like the given is that I care and I will post more stuff but the humanitarian crisis the lack of water the lack of shelter the lack of food means that more people are gonna be giving attention to Gaza right now and the bullying of people who speak out for the civilians on either side either the hostages or the Gotham children is insane no civilians deserve
