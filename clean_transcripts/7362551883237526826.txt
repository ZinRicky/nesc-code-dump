The best people in life are the ones who can pretty much find anything interesting people who are curious about other people's passions if you tell someone about the book or something you enjoy cooking any passion that you have and they find it interesting and they're curious about it That makes them a better person a better friend when they're curious about your passions whatever you're passionate about they genuinely care and ask you questions There’s nothing worse than when you wanna talk about your passions and they're like oh yeah cool.. they dismiss you or they don't care or they just wanna change the topic or talk about themselves Maybe their interest or passions aren't your thing but why not be curious about them You’re not asking too much to have someone emotionally understand you and hear you are that's why I think people who are curious and interested of your passions are the best kinds of people/friends
