I'm just gonna say it but being a stay at home mom is easy oh my sweet sweet summer child let us have a tiny conversation experienced stay at home mom to brand new working mom number one wholeheartedly respect working moms you guys work hard as hell 2 you admitted in your video that you have three grown adults watching your 1 6 month old child so you can get everything done my mind that would recognise to you that you see the value of somebody taking all of those responsibilities off of your plate your reality is not gonna be my reality I have a 9 year old a 7 year old and a 2 year old and I homeschool the two older ones but even before that parenting exponentially gets harder when your kids starts moving as much as you find it easy to get your duties done during the weekend when you have your six month old full time that baby is not yet walking leaving messes in its wake that definitely changes things I don't wanna make you scared for the future because honestly all stages of having a child are beautiful but when you use your inexperience to shit on other mothers oh you're gonna be eating some humble pie at some point cause being a stay at home mom is a lot of things but easy is not one of them and the ignorance of your inexperience is gonna shine bright one day if it's not already cause you voice your opinion on TikTok moms have a hard enough time getting recognition for the hard hard work and unpaid and unrecognised labour that we do we don't need to be doing this to each other it's not the revolutionary take that you think it is it doesn't make your labor as a working mom more valuable to downplay the labor of stay at home moms all it does is help erase the validation of domestic labor being valuable which honestly just works against all women and mothers in particular
