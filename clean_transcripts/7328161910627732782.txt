I just got home from one of the longest home school days I have all three kids with me we started with like the gym and gymnastics and math and the library and lessons and it was super fun it was it was reminded me of like my stay at home mom days with like lots of activities but now just like three instead of two but I'm also having like a really over stimulated day like I feel like I've been running around like a chicken with my head got off cause basically have and I just got home took off my accessories my shoes off put on some blippi and listen I'm I get it I get the YouTube criticism we're weaning we're gonna wean off blippi maybe eventually but this is the first time all day no one has been whining at me no one has been touching me no one needs anything like for a full time stay at home homeschool mom like that bit of just peace
