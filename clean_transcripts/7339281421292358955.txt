Let's make honey cinnamon butter. I have my local milk that I bought from the local farm not very far from my house. And you can see the separation between the milk and the cream. We're gonna remove the cream and make the butter. Let me show you the consistency of it right now. So it's solidly whipped cream, and it still has several more minutes to go to. About 10 minutes of it already whipping, so it takes a while for it to get there. Add a few shakes of salt. Cinnamon. Raw honey. Oh, my gosh. Better than Texas Roadhouse. I think now it's time to make biscuits to go with my butter.
