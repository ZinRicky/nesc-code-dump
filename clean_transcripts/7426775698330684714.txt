this is deliberate. For centuries pregnancy and motherhood have been monolithically described as beautiful, glowing— a gift— the anti choice movement needs that to be the *sole* narrative so that it can position women who need abortions as these selfish, irrational monsters. they act like pregnancy is a mere ~inconvenience~ when in reality we know that for many it is a traumatic, unwanted, unpaid labor that leaves some women dead, disabled, forever wounded there is literally NO other area of US jurisprudence where we would ever force our citizens to do such dangerous unpaid labor that could cost them their life we don't even require blood or organ donations from dead people but the patriarchy has brainwashed society into believing that pregnancy is a gift and at worst it's a mere inconvenience so that people can get behind forcing women to do it
