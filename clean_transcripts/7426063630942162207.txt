I have a playlist on my top little thing. I don't keep them updated that great. They're, like, old. But there is one called The Dress. And you can see the original dress video. And then in order, kind of some of the videos. I took on the fucking Shade Room. Wrote a whole article about it. It became, like, a big fucking deal. It was kind of funny. That video still has, like, 1.6 million videos. And part of that was because Fucking Mama taught. Sent her whole. Fucking Mama taught tater tots at me. And people were like, you're such a horrible mom. You're such a horrible mom. And they don't know shit about fuck.
