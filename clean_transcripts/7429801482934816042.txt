so if you're looking into homeschooling there are a couple different ways to go about it and one of those ways is unschooling that's just a method of homeschooling um unschooling pretty basically is the idea of not doing any sort of like institutionalized learning curriculum learning or workbook type learning the hypothesis is that kids learn from their environment and like it's a much more freeform way of learning or teaching um it's not something that I necessarily do or adhere to but I definitely see other people who do it and love it and get a lot out of it um but my family actually does a hybrid of curriculum and unit study homeschooling which means for certain subjects I have set curriculum and curriculum books and we follow along on the schedule and then when we need to shake things up we do a unit study which is basically accomplishing all of your core subject requirements
