people don't actually understand that just because you like traditional roles in a relationship It doesn't mean that you're enslaved to a man, or that it's enslavement in general. Being a stay at home mom or wife shouldn't be demonized by society relationship should be LEAD with respect, and honoring your partner with full devotion, Everybody’s life is different, if you like to be a housemaker/ a homemaker; cook, clean, etcetera, then do that! and if you don't? then don't! It’s that simple I'm not sure where we went wrong in society? where we shouldn't want to do those things? We shouldn't enjoy to do these things? In my opinion traditional roles in a marriage do NOT “enslave” me to a man instead it brings enrichment and value to my life! Life should be about family, not bickering who's gonna do the chores! now, if you don't believe in traditional roles, then don't believe in it! but I'm just saying that we shouldn't demonize it as a society!
