I'm going out tonight and my Uber is arriving in about 35 minutes and that means my husband's been tasked with handling all of the after school activities with the kids so I wanted to make sure that there was a delicious and veggie packed meal waiting for when they got home right But I also don't have a whole lot of time so I'm just gonna throw together a yummy chicken noodle stir fry using Wattie’s Wok Creations and honestly this could not get any easier saute onion and chicken and then add a whole bag of the Wattie’s Vietnamese Style Frozen Stir Fry veggies I'm using fresh egg noodles so these can just go right on the wok with no pre-cooking and I'm smothering all of that with the Wattie’s Wok Creations Honey Soy Stir Fry Sauce let that all simmer together for about five minutes and then season to taste top that with fresh mung beans chopped roasted peanuts and coriander and you will have a delicious meal ready in under 30 minutes on weeknights I'm always looking for quick easy, family friendly meals that are packed with veggies and that actually taste good and this one did not disappoint
