I got these markers from the TikTok shop, and I genuinely had no idea how much my children were gonna love them. We sat here for hours colouring. They kinda just lived on my kitchen table from that point on. And we all just kinda pick them up and coloured pictures as we wanted. It was really beautiful. You could tell that they really, really felt loved and fulfilled. It was, like the easiest way to spend really loving, quality time with my kids. And it's gonna be a regular in our house now. I absolutely love it. They're linked right here if you wanna buy a set.
