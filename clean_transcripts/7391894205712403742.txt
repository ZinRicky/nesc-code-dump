remember those lesson plans I did yesterday yeah they're already out the window because last time my mother in law decided she wanna pick the kids up this morning for a sleepover and we try really hard not to say no to family things so we got up early and got our butts and gear we never start school for 10:00am and this morning we started at a whopping 8:00am we started the morning with a math game and let me just tell you the math was not mathing so we jumped into our read alouds and let me just tell you trying to explain into the kids what poetry is BRB I need to go look that up because what is poetry I don't actually know let's add that to the list of things I need to learn about the kids worked on their handwriting and phonics independently while I set up their reading activity today we do short and long vowels and open and close syllables here's a tip if your curriculum is not teaching kids when and why to use short and long vowels you need a new reading curriculum and you know what side words if it is teaching side words toss it because one thing we're not gonna do is we are not gonna not teach our kids how to read properly so we're gonna focus on phonemic awareness and how to decode words reading is best taught with multi sensory lessons so add a lot of tactical activities into your reading instruction if you're wondering what the heck we're doing at this store it's because this is a very visual way to show open and close syllables now back to safe words we're not gonna teach our kids to memorize words but we are gonna teach them irregular words these are words that don't have a normal phonetic sound we're gonna teach him what part of the word of your regular so they know those letters or sounds aren't going to be the same in other words if I had you really confused I highly recommend you look into the orangellingham method it'll teach you everything you need to know about teaching reading and if you have questions my DMs and comments are always open
