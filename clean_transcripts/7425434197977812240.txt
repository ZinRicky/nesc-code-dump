I love the feeling of a clean house more than probably anything else but lately it's been staying clean for a depressingly short amount of time so I've officially given up okay we all know that's a lie but lately the weather's been kind of warming up so I've turned my attention to the garden because that's one area I can do and at least it will stay done for a good chunk of time and if you want your gardening to take twice as long but also be twice as eventful do it with your mini me in my mind I wasn't gonna plant the tomatoes all in a row at the back of this planter but olive had other ideas and I know that there is absolutely no point arguing with a girl that has two older brothers Said by a girl who also has two older brothers and has never lost an argument, so.. I've got a couple of new archway trellises connecting my plant boxes and I'm really hoping to be able to train things like courgette cucumber rockmelon etcetera up and over it's a little bit annoying cause my shallot and my leek aren't quite done and they're taking up prime position on the other side but that's okay we'll just work around once we got the seedlings in the planters we decided to turn this nothing space into a bit of a flower bed olive and I are desperate to grow more flowers so this was us making a start but I think we might also try do a bit of chaos gardening cause we've got a whole bunch of seeds and we just wanna put them everywhere Mark built us some trellises before we made the garden twice as big so watch this space
