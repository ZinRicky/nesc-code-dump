y'all I am capital T I R E D tired this week I don't know what is going on but I am exhausted and have no motivation we have been doing the bare minimum this week when it comes to homeschooling and by bare minimum I've been reading eggs and math seeds have been the majority of our math and language arts this I did switch it up today and pull out our magnetic letters instead of using the banana grams tile I like to switch up resources every once in a while so the lessons don't get boring we use all about reading and it is an incredible reading curriculum it follows the science of reading and really focuses on the mastery of phonics is really incredible for building that reading foundation but the lesson structure is the same week in and week out and if you don't do things to make it fun and engaging your kids are gonna get really bored really fast so I always like to switch up the activities to keep it fun and fresh and keep them on their toes if you're using all about reading in your homeschool and want some ideas of ways to make it fun let me know
