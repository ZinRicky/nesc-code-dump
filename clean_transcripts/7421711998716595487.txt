You guys, I got my boyfriend this sweater from the TikTok shop, and he immediately put it on, and he was like, Dang, this thing is warm. I kinda like it. Kinda got lost in the moment and started playing his guitar. But then I realized I kinda like it. So I don't know who's gonna win the battle of the sweater, but if you want one, it's linked right here.
