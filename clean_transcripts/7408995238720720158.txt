So today is a kitchen restock day. I'm gonna show you my little OOTD sourdough bread because we're doing stretching folds. So this is like my baby attached to my hip apron from World Market. That a long time ago. My only apron. I need to get more because she is starting to wear off. And then dress is from H M. I got it a long time ago. Um, and I'm finally starting to wear it. And then sandals are from Riza. They are grounding barefoot sandals, so love that for me. Um, and, yeah, this is what we got going on.
