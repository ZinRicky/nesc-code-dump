Here's some foods I made today as a mom who has three young children and wants her family to have optimal health. Started off the morning making overnight fermented freshly milled iron corn pancakes served with raw butter and a fried egg from our pasture raised chickens out back. At 8:00am I made myself an omelet using two eggs from my pasture raised chickens along with some leftover salad from dinner. I wanted to surprise my kids with cinnamon rolls when they came back from school today, so around noon I shaped sourdough pumpkin cinnamon rolls and let those rise for about two hours. I also made a large batch of mayonnaise to have on hand for lunch boxes for a few weeks to use in tomorrow's chicken salad. At four PM I quickly prepped a whole chicken which only took 10 minutes and then stuck it in the oven for dinner. After that came out of the oven, I allowed it to rest while getting started on my corn tortillas. While my Kamal heated, I mixed masaharina with water, then kneaded it on the counter until smooth. Then I made small rounds and flattened each with a tortilla press, then cooked them for about 45 seconds per side. Around 5:45 I dressed the salad with a light vinaigrette and served the kids and husband tacos, myself a chicken salad, and at 7:30 I started a bone broth.
