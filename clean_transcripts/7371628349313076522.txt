I just found out that the chainsaw was invented for childbirth it was invented in the 18th century to use on women's pelvises during childbirth if there was a breach or a shoulder dystocia they would saw a portion of the pelvis and not surprisingly a lot of the women did not survive this procedure no anesthesia was used and most of the women that did survive were left super disfigured birth is not dangerous women dying during childbirth in the medieval times was more so due to the fact that they were using archaic tools and they had no concept of hygiene rich women were actually more likely to die during childbirth than poor women this is because rich women had access to doctors who had these fancy new tools where's the poor women were using midwives I will die on my hill that it is safer to birth at home naturally for a healthy woman than it is to go to a hospital and have a doctor still to this day come at me
