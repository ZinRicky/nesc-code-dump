okay I feel a little guilty turns out that knock on my door earlier was my neighbor trying to give my kids some gifts they are getting ready to move out today and aren't gonna be here later and they were trying to catch the kids before they left for school they don't know we homeschool because in my day to day life I don't advertise that I am home all day long alone with my children whole world on the internet might know that but the people next door to me do know so I don't really wish that she had curled milk in her coffee but that spider infestation still stays
