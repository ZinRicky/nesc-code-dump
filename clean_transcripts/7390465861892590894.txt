If you're homeschooling your kids this summer and you're doing CBC Words, this is a great way to practice. It comes with this cool little pop it and a whole stack of cards to get practicing with. It also comes with plenty of dry erase pens. Now, there's a few different ways you can practice with this, but we started out just standing out the word, adding the letters into the pop it, and then by finally adding the missing vowel. And this was very useful to help him practice with his CBC words. And there's plenty of clause to practice with.
