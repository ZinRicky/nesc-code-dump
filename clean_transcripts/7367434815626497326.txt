come check out goodwill with me today where I find something I've been looking for for the longest time I go to goodwill three times a week and I'm always on the look for a coach vintage purse and I finally found the first one today I was super excited and at first I wasn't sure if it was a coach and then it is I opened it up and there's no liner which is perfect I knew I could restore this bag and then the disappointment came because there is a massive hole what in the world happened to this bag they still had this bag for us at 9 99 and with the whole it's kinda trash I don't think I can fix it so next time
