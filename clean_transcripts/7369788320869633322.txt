will say like oh it's cause they don't like you enough and I just never felt like that was like I fucking hate when people say oh he just didn't like you like that he just didn't like you enough um you're gonna have to or when people say this about themselves about their own relationships they're like oh I'm gonna have to watch the next girl get treated the way that she deserves the way that I deserved to be treated just because he's gonna actually love her and she's gonna pull out all the traits and characteristics in him that I just couldn't because I was just an inferior woman like bitch oh my god obviously people aren't publicly saying out loud like I'm just an inferior woman and that's why he treated me the way that he did but that's like the underpinning right that's the quiet part cuz let me say something controversial here I was treated so horribly I was treated the worst by the one man that I've been with who I think actually had really deep and true feelings for me I think that those two things are like not related I think that they're not correlated at all I think that men because of patriarchy this is how men suffer under patriarchy I think that they're willing to shoot themselves in the foot and they're willing to sabotage their own happiness just to not lose their sense of control and power I think that a man can have really true deep feelings for a woman like I think that a man can love a woman and still treat her like absolute shit like I think that's what happened to me personally might be controversial to say but that's my lived experience personally but also regardless of whether or not he had deep feelings for you it's possible to not have really deep feelings for someone and still not treat them like shit the reason why men treat women like shit is because of patriarchy hello it's because of like the ways in which our system is set up to allow men to get away with shit okay I'm just rambling now at this point cause I'm a little tipsy but listen I've been watching Bridgerton like we all have been I watched Bridgerton today and watching Bridgerton I think about the fact that like when a man did something dishonorable once upon a time if a man treated a woman in a dishonorable way um meet me at dawn motherfucker pistols drawn like we're gonna duel over this nowadays it's not like that anymore men just do whatever the fuck they wanna do and their homies don't check them and obviously women don't have the power to check them anyway stop taking the way a man treats you personally men do not act rationally the way that they feel about you the way they feel about a situation and um you and who you are and your character and your value and your worth not correlated at all to the way a man treats you
