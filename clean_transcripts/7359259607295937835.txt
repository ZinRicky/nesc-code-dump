y'all will post things like this and genuinely not see a single issue with this fact you can buy 3 shirts 3 shirt for less than a price of a burger does that not ring like a single alarm bell in your brain are there like any thoughts further than oh I can get more I can consume more you have no thoughts that are like oh I wonder how can this shirt be that cheap what's going on behind the scenes that will make these three shirts cheaper than a burger I'm not even one of those people that demonizes fast fashion because I think it's a very complex issue and I do know that at least for plus size people fast fashion is often the only option that we have but like we need to work on a relationship to clothing cause the way that fast fashion has genuinely changed the way that we think about clothes the average consumer fast fashion does not comprehend how much clothing is actually worth because every time you buy these items of clothing for like less than $5 it almost always means that somewhere along line there are people being exploited to make that garment for you I know this will get people to change their opinion overnight but like think about your relationship to consumption into clothing and understand the consequences of you being able to buy a three dollar shirt
