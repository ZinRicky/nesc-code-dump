I'm waiting on our pasture raised cowshare to be ready for pickup so I restocked on some grass fed beef and a pasture raised chicken for bone broth got some sprouts for easy micronutrients cucumbers and onions for pickling I love this raw cheese and pasture cottage cheese for easy protein and then raw kefir for beneficial microbes and holy butter both coconut water and dates are good sources of potassium and then mushrooms have so many health benefits fruits an obvious one because it's an easy carb & packed full of micronutrients and antioxidants avocados for saturated fat limes for electrolytes and then these two are always in our fridge and though these ones are not from this grocery haul these are sprouts favorites that are literally always in my kitchen
