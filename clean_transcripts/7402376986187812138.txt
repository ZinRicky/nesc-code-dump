You ever smell a scent and it reminds you of something that you've eaten before? Ever since I started using the Mason Margiela Replica Afternoon Delight fragrance, all I can think about is making vanilla custard. Reminds me of all the moments I spend in Paris indulging in sweet afternoon pastries, especially those with a custard base. The scent smells warm and sweet, and you can really smell the vanilla in it. I started making my custard, bringing it to a boil on the stove, and I pulled it off, added my vanilla bean, some butter, whisked that all together before pouring it into a bowl to cool. After a few hours, it was the perfect consistency, so I plated it up. I always need some strawberries with my custard, and this was the perfect afternoon delight.
