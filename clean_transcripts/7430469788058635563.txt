I'm so excited that it's finally fall and I have started to incorporate fall transitional wardrobes and we're switching the makeup up so I just got 4 new Revlon lipsticks they're all super Moody for fall and I wanna try them on with you because Revlon is my favourite drugstore lipstick and they can do no wrong so I have four shades right here let's try em first one is Rum Raisin very Rachel Green the next is vampire love this one's in the same shade family but definitely darker and definitely a little bit more blue toned this is Raisin Rage could I have little bit of the makeup you want some lipstick so this one is more like a brick red which I really like but definitely not like as Berry toned as I would like little more orange to it okay actually this is growing on me I think I do really like this now this is definitely the darkest one this is black cherry and I've worn this for years now this one is a truly vampy perfect for Halloween and fall season burgundy Berry lip what do you think do you like my lipstick um it's too darkish I guess he's not a fan
