hey friends I'm gonna show you how I do my bun head scarf so first I make a low ponytail then I'm using a sock bun and you're just gonna make this bun like you would usually putting the hair over the bun securing it with a hair tie I just use a scrunchie because no one's gonna see it and then pinning the hair in place this is not need to be tidy or neat in any way just make sure the hairs up off the base of your neck as you can see mine is a little messy now I'm putting a velvet hair band on which will help secure the silk scarf it's a square scarf that I'm tying into a triangle I'm gonna put this on my head and then tie at the base of my neck now I'm gonna take the ends pull them all the way up and then tie at the top of the bun just gonna make one knot and then you're going to tie the bottom of the bun over the tail and you're gonna make a knot so you're gonna tie it twice then I'm twisting the tail and I'm gonna tuck it into where I had tied the ends and then I'm tucking everything else in and then I secure the scarf with hair pins
