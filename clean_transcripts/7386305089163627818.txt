listen I am getting older I'm getting wiser I wanna be in with the news and with the times so I watched the presidential debate that was hands down the cringiest thing I was at a loss for words and their reactions and responses who are we supposed to vote for genuinely I guess it was entertaining so I gotta give Trump for that he definitely brings in the views But could anyone actually watch that fully? what are we supposed to do what are the Americans supposed to do Who do we vote for? Did y'all get anything out of that debate Anyways see you later alley cats
