So I thought I was gonna go as alphabet. I thought I was gonna go green, but I think deep down I like pink too much. What do we think? This is my option for Glenda, and I have a much more casual outfit for Alphabet. I don't know what to go. I'm gonna go with my kids, and it's a three hour movie. So I'm thinking sweatshirt, green skirt. But this outfit needs its own moment. But I don't know if the movie theater is the place for it. And it's way too fancy for just every day. But I think I found a new holiday look. Glenda style. What are you, Elphaba or Glenda
