They say those who can't do, teach. I was once a tried wife. But now I'm just a single mother. My name is Anita. Like pizza. And this is the shit I eat now. Used to be home cooked foods. Bread. Delicious home cooked bread. And now I spend my time hanging out with friends. Building deeper relationships with my kids. I don't even care what men think about me anymore. I have a mind of my own. I think I have opinions. If you stay focused on just your husband, I'm sure you'll do better than I did. Stay tuned for the next lesson.
