as a mother of three let me tell you why I absolutely love this parallel toy firstly look at the terrain this thing covers grass dirt sand gravel we tested it on everything and it did not struggle this is true four wheel drive this is actually remote controls the parent have full control of a baby it even has a Bluetooth radio so you can play your own music or the music that comes of it and my son like that part it actually has spring suspension so no harsh bumps it has this cute little storage area that my son likes to bring his snacks and teddy bears in the bar lights actually do light up and they're really bright LED lights and so does the head lamps in the front so you can definitely use this in the evenings this Jeep had no problem in all the terrains on our farm my other children also had fun they were 4 and 7 and they also love to drive it it can be driven by the steering wheel as well it also had great suspension and had no issues going over these poles right here my son absolutely loved it and your kids are gonna love it too
