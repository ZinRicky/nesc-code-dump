this is not a euphemism but I asked my husband to pop to the shops and bring me home a lot of soil and a little bit of corn but of course he brought home a little bit of soil and a lot of corn and I'm really hoping it's just cause he can't listen for shit and not because it's indicative of a greater issue that I need to be aware of anyway once again I've been distracted by my garden cause I find that the results of gardening lasts a lot longer than the results of cleaning not that I don't need to do that as well I need to do a lot of things this poor renovation has been seriously kicking my ass but a week or so ago I found a bunch of plants at the school fair for $2 and even though I don't really have any room for any more plants if you're selling them for $2 I will buy as many as I can carry and normally I would just shall we say bribe my husband to build me a new planter box but I seriously think that that poor man might be at capacity considering I've just convinced him to renovate a 50 year old pool with no pool renovation experience so I'm on my own with this one and with limited soil resources apparently but I have an unused space behind my plant boxes and I thought maybe I could utilise it I added three cucumbers to the existing planter box and back here I'm gonna add two pumpkins three very sick looking sunflowers and like 24 corns for some reason anyway at this point I have no idea if they're gonna take I might have to go in with some more soil and kinda build it up a little bit but they were seriously gonna die if I left them in their containers any more so I did my best alright? my little garden makes me so happy I come out here multiple times a day and just enjoy checking on it and I need you to tell me that I'm not the only one that likes talking to her plants cause I swear it makes them grow more okay
