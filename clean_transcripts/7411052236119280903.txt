I wanna talk about the history of women using male pseudonyms JK Rowling and gender fluidity and where the conversation is at today so I'm Doctor Zoe I have a PhD in digital feminist activism and I talk a lot about hot sticky feminist topics so I've noticed recently that there is growing discourse about how JK Rowling is using gender fluidity to her own advantage while denying others the opportunity to do the same and this is so interesting to me because years and years ago I brought this up when she started using Robert Galbraith um to publish under for her crime series and obviously she's always said that she used JK so that people would know that her name was Joanne so that she could kind of benefit from the Assumption that she was a man but a few years ago people would not into that argument pro trans people would say well it's different it's not the same you can't equate transness with using male pseudonym JK Rowling has been doing this for years since the start and I wanna talk about why it's suddenly an accepted argument to use when a few years ago it wasn't so the reason is really that society's understanding of gender expression has progressed a lot in the last five or 10 years so this is now exposing JK Rowling's hypocrisy in a way that it previously wasn't really widespread understood so firstly let's look at how the trans rights debate has evolved so JK Rowling's position on trans rights has been very fixed in gender essentialism the idea that your gender is determined by your biology at birth and is immutable so it's no longer lost on people that those who prescribe to the idea of gender like JK Rowling believe the gender is very firmly fixed should not be then using gender fluidly in the way that they portray themselves to the world I think it's also really important to acknowledge at this point that the use of male pseudonyms by female authors is not at all a new thing we know about the Bronte sisters that wrote under the bell brothers we know George Elliott did this whose name is actually Marianne Evans and this is very much lauded as a feminist thing that they had to do to get by in a patriarchy they would have never gotten published otherwise if you read the forwards to the Bronty sisters books defending that they are the bell brothers it's very funny now that we know that they are the Bronty sisters but I think it's well understood that this is just resistance against patriarchy and is very accepted and very acceptable that women in 19th century did this let's talk about what makes it different when JK Rowling does it it's pretty clear she didn't do it to gain entry into the literary world she was already a huge success um with Harry Potter obviously before she came out as Robert Galbraith so she didn't really need to do it it's more something that she wanted to do and I believe that she wanted to continue to operate with the same privileges um that she had before and actually be able to put her work out there without the previous judgement of Harry Potter so it wasn't something that she did for necessity but rather something that she did um to extend her privilege um to to extend the way her books would be received and I think that these days that comes across very inauthentic to people people find that to be yeah not really the vibe so we have rolling a cisgender woman being able to fluidly navigate between the genders as she pleases depending on how she wants her persona to be portrayed depending on how she wants people to perceive her work and her writing meanwhile she is spreading trans hate but the next thing I wanna talk about for a little bit of a tricky thing it's about the evolution of the way that we understand gender and transness we used to very much rely on this idea of born in the wrong body um that you've got a dysphoria that needs to be changed and fixed and I think that we are progressing beyond just that as an understanding of transness this kind of rhetoric also mirrors the gay rights movement that where we really spoke about gayness for a very long time as I was born this way and it is in my biology somehow that I am gay and that was a really necessary I guess way way to talk about it to get conservative buy in um for the gay rights movement but I think now sexuality is understood as a lot more fluid on that and a lot more influenced by our agency and our society um social conditioning um what's acceptable um as well as how you were born so let's take the concept of political lesbianism I know this is very controversial and a lot of people don't like the idea of it people are threatened by the idea that you might be able to choose that's because we relied on the idea that you can't choose to show that gay people should have human rights so this idea was essential to the gay rights movement because it really neutralized conservative opposition to um different sexualities people like to understand something as fixed and innate and struggle with anything else people feel threatened by the idea that maybe sexuality is a little fluid sometimes um and a little flexible and people struggle with understanding gender the same way but I believe we're undertaking a shift right now where people are beginning to understand gender as a lot less fixed lot more fluid and flexible we are moving beyond the born this way narrative that is the logical conclusion that I don't think people have been able to hasn't been making sense to me for a long time why people haven't been able to see that but to me that's the logical conclusion go back to our Queen of fantasy JK Rowling now I wanted to use the JK Rowling example to discuss this because I think it is a great signifier for where we're at in this conversation and how it's progressed moving beyond the rigid and the fixed and the irony of someone who uses fluid gender constructs for personal gain and personal wealth while also throwing trans people under the bus is now very obvious to everyone I think this marks a shift in our consciousness about gender and how we're understanding it as expressive as fluid and we're rejecting the rigidity of the previous conversation thanks for listening I'm Doctor Zoe and I have written about this on substack which you can now subscribe to to support survivors and you can also buy our merch
