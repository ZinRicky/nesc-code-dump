my toxic trait is that I searched Zillow for things that I cannot have so if you don't know we have a family compound and we are going to be building our house we have lived there in an RV for four years and in January we were supposed to start our house build we submitted permanent and all of the things it is now August and we still don't have a permit to build our house I am going nuts we finally just decided to move out the RV get a rental so we are okay mentally but I still want my dream home but I just got a notification from Zillow that the property adjacent to us dropped its price and it dropped its price to relatively the same cost of what it's going to cost us to build our dream home now the catch is it's acreage and a tiny mobile home versus our 5,000 square foot dream home but is it worth it it might be worth it I think I need to convince my husband we should do the mobile home and the acreage and put a pause on the house build what do y'all think
