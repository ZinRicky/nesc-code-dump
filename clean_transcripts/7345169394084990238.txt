TikTok ruined going down a rabbit hole I don't know if I'm the only person who's noticed this but one of my few pleasures in life is going down a deep dark rabbit hole on the internet whenever I find a new topic or like literally anything if I wanna recipe if I'm traveling somewhere whatever but the problem is now with TikTok instead of going to a hashtag and then being able to scroll through a bunch of videos with that hashtag TikTok will basically like it will like base the videos that you're seeing off of the last video you watched for example I was trying to figure out how to like fix my camera settings like I have the iPhone 15 and like you know when the selfie like automatically sharpen literally the most hideous thing in the world anyways I know there's a way to fix it or I hope there is but like I don't know what it is so I went on TikTok to try and figure it out and I have like maybe three videos on that topic and then the video started being iPhone 15 videos and like then I had a couple of iPhone 15 videos and then like after that it was like does that make sense like instead of being able to go down like rabbit hole of the hashtag or like the theme that you choose theyâ€™re trying to for you page the like search and it literally is my biggest pet peeve because how can you take something as sacred as the internet rabbit hole and like destroy it like that so upsetting
