but y'all acting like men are scarier than bears you ain't watching up nature documentaries I would 100% choose to be stranded in a forest alone with a bear over a man proved to you by that's the logical choice let's go even bigger instead of a forest let's do like a battlefield and like instead of a there let's do an entire army that's trying to kill you you would assume that women would be safer with a man that they're stranded with over the enemy you will be wrong according to data from the Pentagon a woman in the military is more likely to be raped by a male fellow soldier than to be killed by enemy fire given that men who are supposed to be protecting us pose a literal greater threat than actual war on a battlefield I think we're okay with the bane of forest it's actually it's actually a walk in the park compared to you know living your daily life with men around while bears and menacing armies pose a real threat to women statistically speaking the good guys can be even more treachless the reason why men the reason why so many men don't get this is because gender based violence is fundamentally misunderstood cause it requires understanding that the safest place for men and the safest people for men are usually the most perilous for women the home which is assumed to be a safe place is the most dangerous place for a woman strangers most men who are killed are killed by people that they don't know most women are killed by someone that they know a member of their family or someone that they are dating or used to date 90% of women know their rapist so let's even take this very experiment even further like let's say that women can be stuck in the forest with a man that she knows that is statistically let's say for her basically like the problem here is not inherently male right like if you were to ask a girl bear uh you know the same question would you rather be stuck with a boy bear or with like a predator like a mountain lion like she would probably choose the boy bear because bears don't hunt with like male bears don't hunt female bears but humans do in this bare video the reason why so many men are upset about it is that it makes us face this uncomfortable truth right that the patriarchy makes men hunt their own kind their own species in the language around dating right about like men hunting their prey like women aren't the play what are you saying we're the same bro like what are you talking about the more men can be curious about women's experience rather than like invalidate it the closer we can get to changing these structure and that men get to live in the world where they're not more feared than bear if women are brave enough to face a bear in the woods and maybe men can be brave enough to have a conversation about why subscribe to my sub sack for more
