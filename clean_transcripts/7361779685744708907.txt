The reality is, I would choose the bear. You would choose the bear. We would all choose the bear. Collectively, as the internet is female presenting people, we all would choose the bear. And I can't speak for everyone's reasons why they would choose the bear. But the reason I told my husband is this. Because a bear doesn't hate people the same way men hate women. And if I'm gonna die anyway, I would choose the dignity and death of being mauled by a bear. Then a scary, scary man who wants to take his time. Because the scariest of bears will never be scarier than the scariest of men. And if I'm gonna die anyway, I will take the dignity and death of a natural death from a wild animal. Then I would take the creative torture that a man can provide.
