join us for the first day of school my kids are in first and second grade and this is our third year homeschool I try to make the first day of school special so we had doughnuts for breakfast we are doing Legos we have shirts and we're taking first day of school pictures we were going to do an afternoon pool day but Hurricane Debbie had other plans for it it's okay the kids still got to go to their grandparents and take pictures with them and hang out and play as the kids have gotten older I've continued to add more and more things into our school routine so to keep our school days short and keep their attention the best I can I decided to try loop scheduling this Mondays and Thursdays we're doing language Bible and geography Tuesdays and Fridays we're doing math science and Bible on Wednesdays they have their farm school co op and we'll do reading and wonder if you've never heard of wonder booking let me put you on to some if your kids are anything like mine they're probably asking a million questions throughout the school they're really good questions so I am known to stop what I'm doing and go investigate to find the answers to whatever questions they have but that also means we get distracted and way off track way too much so instead of looking at the information right away I'm gonna stop and write an I wonder question and put it on our and then on Wednesdays we'll choose one of those questions and do a dive into the research behind what the question whatever information we find into our wonder note and then at the end of the school year we'll have a whole book of wonderful questions that we found the answers to I'm really excited about this because my kids really do come up with some of the best questions and they're so curious this will give us a dedicated time to answer questions and research and find all of the things that they are excited about and as a bonus it won't interrupt our studies anymore this is something I'm really excited to add into our homeschool what are you adding in that you're really excited about
