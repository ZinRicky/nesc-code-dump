post therapy look look at those eyes today was a doozy one of the things I'm working on right now is allowing Jesus to redeem the relationship between my parents and being able to forgive without them ever acknowledging or apologizing for any of the wrongdoings because the reality is they do not have the same experiences that I do and what I mean by that is I lived to those experiences as a child and not in an altered state so a lot of these things that I am working through on the trauma that I'm experiencing they have no recognition of it whether they like totally don't remember it happening or they're in denial that it happened who knows but they do not acknowledge the things that happened to me as a kid but I still lived them I experienced them and I have to work through the trauma knowing that this is not gonna be two sided that I have to be the one working through it to find healing in myself
