you know that meme that's been circulating around? the one that goes like if I win the lotto you won't know, but there will be signs and then usually the meme has a picture of like a unique house or car uh which got me thinking, what would I do if I won the lottery? I definitely wouldn't be flashy with my money I probably start a pet daycare or a cat cafe you know somewhere you would go get a coffee maybe a pastry and then you can cuddle with cats! like that would be enough for me, nothing flashy, just kitty cuddles! oh my god that'd be a cute name so I'm curious, if you won the lottery what would you do with your money?
