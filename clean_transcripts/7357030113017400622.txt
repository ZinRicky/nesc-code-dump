as a woman I feel safe when men are acknowledging their mistakes not when they're minimizing them your story is so unique but it's also an experience that a lot of men can relate to where you were victim and you were perpetrator I mean we all under patriarchy that's pretty much the deal for men right you're hurt by patriarchy you're hurt by men who exploit your weaknesses or your vulnerability then you're taught to not have any vulnerability and so then you end up taking it out in your romantic relationship do you feel that dichotomy you know of being victim and and perpetrator is that hard to fathom and then how do you approach that as a man in our society yeah I think that that's comes back to seeing seeing myself act in certain ways and and make choices that um I feel are so out of character for myself and not who I wanna be and not who I wanna be in the future you you can't minimize um who you've hurt and and the actions you've taken you I have to take accountability for for the choices that I've made and make amends as well I just know that when I make those choices that's not who I am I wanna find out what it is and how I can change
