I get these types of comments all the time often from men as if it's some type of valid argument for restricting abortion like never mind the fact that a lot of women don't consent never mind the fact that women who do consent and have a wanted pregnancy may still need abortion care like it's just an obsession with blaming and punishing women right like we're blaming women all the time for not having enough sex there's so much discourse around the male loneliness epidemic and how not enough women are choosing to be with men we're also blaming women for not having enough babies so we're constantly talking about the declining birth rate and so how women aren't not only have they're not having enough sex they're not having enough babies but then when they do have consensual sex um we blame them for that too like well why didn't you just keep your legs shut but men will be straight up sexually violent they will do horrible things and think of the Brock Turner case the judge was like well like uh I he has so much life ahead of him like I don't want this to change the trajectory of his life once the conversation is about men and their horrible decisions consequences are suddenly so hard to understand then you think about the fact that a lot of people will argue well like we should have exceptions for grape then you should be able to get an abortion cause you've been a good girl because who they want to punish is the women who are freely having consensual sex this stuff shame on her like women who seek pleasure and connection must be willing to perform life threatening reproductive labor for society again none of this even matters because even if the dude abides ugh could shackle women all women who freely engage in consensual sex you are shackled to um reproductive labour if you do become pregnant we would still need abortion care women who have very wanted pregnancies at times find themselves in a situation where they need to terminate their pregnancy it's literally just an obsession with being mad at women where we don't have enough sex we have too much sex we're not having enough babies shame on you for having a baby like it's relentless
