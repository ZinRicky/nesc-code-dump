so I've heard about the Pop of Red Theory right you know how a pop of red somewhere unexpected within your interiors just somehow makes it look elevated anyway so I was born in the 90s okay so I remember when my parents had a red jug and a red toaster Side Story but there is absolutely no way I can use the sensor on this tap without feeling like a surgeon and I'm gonna complete the look with standard issue surgical rubber gloves now bend over and cough anyway so as I was saying my parents and come to think of it pretty much everyone I knew’s parents subscribed to the pop of Red Theory and I mean you no offence if you have a red toaster or a red jug all I'm saying is at the time from my younger selfs’ perspective I was like ew why would you do this and I guess that's on how nothing your parents do is ever cool enough right and as a mother of three I can attest to that anyway then us millennials went on to invent millennial grey and objectively that also was terrible so short story long ‘pop of red done different’ is in and cut to me up cycling this old tray that I had lying around I sanded it primed it with a plastic primer which I'm praying is gonna be the right one and now I'm going in with my red and I will just admit there wasn't a whole lot of reds to choose from I was ideally hoping for more of a crimson or merlot colour you know to match my nails and my jumper this one's giving fire truck if you've ever seen that one Family Guy episode but I actually really like how it's turned out the red is Redding Fk that's easily the most millennial thing I've ever said my children are for sure gonna cancel me over that one but I think the moral of this story is that maybe your parents are cooler than you think cause like my parents had a pop of red in a turquoise kitchen which at the time I thought was ugly but right now I kinda dig it anyway what do you think
