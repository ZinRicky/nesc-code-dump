send a day with us when I know lessons are not gonna get done it is already a chaotic week for us today is my father in law's birthday and the kids slept over at their house last night the kids usually sleep over there once a week and getting lessons done the next day is always hard but this week especially is gonna be hard because they are having a big birthday party this weekend they are way too excited and overstimulated by everything going on to focus this but it's okay because I expected this and planned for this so instead of battling it out with them I decided to embrace the chaos and what's more chaotic than starting your week off with a playdate but I did intentionally plan it this way since I know my kids don't do well with a lesson after a sleepover I eliminated the expect attention of getting anything done and had a playdate instead because a playdate is socialization which is homeschooling in my even though I know formal lessons aren't going to happen I still like to get a little bit of learning in the kids watching animals of the United States documentary while I took a shower because I was dripping sweat after that playdate and then we got a little bit of our read aloud in and now we're gonna spend the rest of the day crafting
