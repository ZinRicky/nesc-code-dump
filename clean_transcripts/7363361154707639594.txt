By now, we've all heard. Nick the all and Natalie Joy got married. He's 43, she's 25. It was on her family farm in Georgia. Just beautiful nuptials between, like, the beautiful couple. Kinda reminds me of the beautiful love story of Charlie John's and his wife, Eunice Winstead. They actually only had a 15 year age difference, but, gosh, they were married for 60 years. They had 9 beautiful children. I know the veils already have one that was in their arms at the wedding. It's just. It's beautiful to see love grow like that, you know, beautiful love over the time, over the ages. I love it.
