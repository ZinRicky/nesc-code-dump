Mom and I are getting ready for the day. This is my OG complexion stick. My OG complexion stick right here. This copper. We're both copying this line underneath. Oh, wow. I don't like my nose to be white, so it's a little. I like my neck glowy. Glowy, glowy. Dewy. Dewy. Okay. Dewy gold. And I started wearing it, and it wasn't a day or two, and people were looking at me, and they were saying, you look younger. The bronzer? Yeah. So I like. Yeah, I like. Oh, yeah, I like that. So I'm using rose, but I'm gonna try her toe test. Can I? Okay, so with this one, these are my lips, too, but I usually put a liner on first. You like the pink better on your teeth? I don't like makeup under my brow. It just makes it lift. You lose their lips. Did you put some on? It goes on a little smoother.
