I just came back from a 2014 themed party and I genuinely think that healed something in me sorry I lost my voice because I went to that party and I'm dressed the way that I wish I could have dressed when I was 14:13 like I'm wearing my Huda Beauty lipstick from 2014 like but I am the choker oh my god but literally like this this this is what I would have liked to dress as when I was 14 so being able to now as an adult like a decade later be able to dressed in a way that like I wished I could have literally I felt something heal inside me so if you feel like nurturing your inner child today genuinely go and cosplay like it's that year but now with adult money and adult style and like you know I don't know Iâ€™m really happy there's no way I could have done this makeup in 2014 this is literally what I wish I could have done anyways I am like so happy and content I like the place that I am now and I struggled so much as a kid being a fat kid growing up like is really difficult um and I was like you know I was just felt so out of place all the time and like I just didn't feel at home in my own skin and now I do and everything that I do now I do for this 12 13 14 year old version of me like that little girl thought the only way to be happy was to be skinny so she would be really proud to see me now anyways okay had a great time catching up with my friends from college and I hope you had a good night
