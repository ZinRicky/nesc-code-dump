This has been my favorite late night snack lately. It's currently 11 p m. I just made some strawberries and icing sugar. I just make my icing sugar with some lemon juice and powdered sugar. It is the best thing ever. I don't really like chocolate, so I've never understood the appeal of chocolate covered strawberries. But these. Uh huh. So good.
