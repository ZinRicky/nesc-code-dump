Everyone has their own idea of self care for being honest. Mine is just being at home in my kitchen making something yummy. It's the absolute coziest time of the year. I love finding reasons to stay home and snuggle my babies. I'm partnering with Albertsons to get grocery delivery today so we can have a cozy winter dinner at home together tonight! Tonight I'm actually making a recipe I got from my grandmother for chicken pot pie. I use fresh veggies in it instead of frozen, and I also use fresh rotisserie chicken. It's the ultimate comfort food. Albertsons makes it so easy for me to make something for my family that is simple, cozy, and comforting all without even having to leave my house.
