just jumping on here to tell you two things I absolutely love about the Humitha vacuum it is a super super lightweight vacuum so if you have anyone that struggles with mobility this is the product for them it is so lightweight I can literally hold this with my pinky which also means it's great for kids to use the sticks also adjustable so great for people of any size and the best thing is under $90 can't even take my kids out for dinner for that
