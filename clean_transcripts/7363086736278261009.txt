You're a woman living alone right now. Just know that you are the first woman in your entire lineage to be doing that. Okay? Let me say that again. In your entire ancestry, no woman has ever lived alone. Okay? So don't let these alpha male boys, um, convince you that you were doing something wrong by being single and alone in your early 20s because you are quite literally making history.
