Has been my favorite late night snack lately. Um, it's just vanilla ice cream, okay? I do two scoops, sometimes even four. And then I drizzle it with some good olive oil. Okay? Just stick with me. And then you need some kind of flaky sea salt. I just do the plain one, but sometimes I'm. I also do the smoky one. Sprinkle it on top. It has to be flaky, though. It can't be the normal one. And this is what I have. It's so good. It's so addicting. I don't know whether it's cause I'm pregnant, but 10 out of ten.
