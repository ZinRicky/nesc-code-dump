one of the most valuable lessons I've Learned in my life is that you cannot feel sorry for yourself you have to suck it up no one's gonna save you stop waiting for someone else to save you if you have problems in your life some that can help you is you yes you can go to therapy you can complain about it you can talk to other people but at the end of the day the only person that's gonna be able to change your life is you that's the hard truth it really is feeling sorry or making excuses isn't gonna change your life you have to buckle up face the hard truth grow from your past experiences you're not a bad person you just made bad choices you're not bad then be so much more that is something that I've Learned through a lot of mistakes in my life and experiences don't be hard on yourself and you're so much more than that be proud of how much you try every single day especially when you fall a lot of people try to climb up when they fall and it it hurts when you fall doesn't it? No one likes it, no one wants to learn the hard truth of these experiences, but what you do is you get up and you keep trying don't give up as much as you wanna sit there and cry and make excuses and say oh I'll do better this time no you have to actively work to pursue your better life don't make excuses don't keep filling the void with conversations of I'll do better this time stop what you do is make real changes acknowledge your behaviour and grow from that no one's gonna save you only person who can save you is you if you want a meaningful life if you want the people in your life that mean most to you you have to show up for yourself and not give up on yourself don't crawl into bed and cry don't bury yourself with your trauma get over your trauma
