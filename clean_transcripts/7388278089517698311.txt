if you haven't already met my best friend this is Goldie she's an almost three year old Hungarian Vizsla with a little bit of GSP in her but it feels like just yesterday she was our new baby so much has changed but also nothing has changed she's still the exact same personality she was when we met her Goldie loves to swim, she loves to dig holes although fortunately for me she's grown out of digging up my garden and I think her favourite thing in the world to do is run I'm also fairly confident she subscribes to that philosophy of “never let them know your next move” then our baby turned into a teenager and before I knew it she was all grown up I'm sure everybody says this about their pup but Goldie has a heart of pure gold she's an absolute sweetheart and she doesn't have a bad bone in her body she's grown up with my three children so naturally she thinks she might also be one and we don't have the heart to tell her any different so Vizsla’s are an interesting breed actually they come from a hunting background so she loves to sniff point and retrieve and apparently they're the fifth fastest dog in the world and I would believe it they're a super social breed she's always making friends with other dogs at the park and she really loves people wishes have reputation of being Velcro dogs and I can confirm it's true and if you wanna make her smile just give her a cuddle Goldie gives us her whole heart every single day and we just wanna give her the best life that we can and obviously choosing the right pet food is super important for her overall health and wellbeing both now and in the future and I love Hill’s Pet Nutrition because it's clinically formulated to deliver the most nutritional benefit for her and she loves Hill’s because it tastes good and I know it's good cause when I feed it to her she stops and thanks me Also she can be kind of fussy with her food but she genuinely really likes Hill’s and by feeding her Hill’s I know she'll be healthier stronger and live longer so we can cuddle for years to come
