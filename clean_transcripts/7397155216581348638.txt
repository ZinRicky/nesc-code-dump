okay I need a little afternoon pick me up of coffee we had a playdate this morning which was so fun but I am tired so let's get some coffee in it and while I make myself some coffee I'm gonna tell you about my coffee because it is not like what you see like the Kylie best coffee but pause cause I use water okay so while that brews let's check coffee I really like this life boost I drink half caffeine I cannot handle caffeine anymore but it is a mold free coffee if you did not know coffee is so so high in mold and this is a really great mold free option I have multi 60 so I have to be very cautious about what I'm putting in my body that has mold so this is OK I tried a lot of other brands too but they kinda taste like dirt and this one does not another thing you always think about my coffee is this um perfect supplement collagen this is really great because it is grass fed beef and it has performance added all the good stuff and collagen is really good for your hair nails skin also really good for your joints and digestion and this does not have a flavor and I really like this stuff used to be a coffee creamer addict I needed my coffee to be so sweet until I Learned all the junk that is in coffee creamers and so it was really hard on how to ditch it now I just use a little splash of half and half still have my coffee semi sweet so I think of maple syrup because table sugar white cane sugar whatever you wanna call it is not super great for you so I mean not really is maple syrup but it is better alternative for making your coffee sweet so that is what I do every morning to make myself a cup of coffee
