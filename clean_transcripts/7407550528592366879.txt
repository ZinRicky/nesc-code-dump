we had a pretty normal day today and got through all of our must do items which really felt like a huge win we're just in a really busy season right now between all of the birthdays buying a house packing and moving plus our co op starting back up we had a really hard time staying focused and motivated with our lesson part of it is me being stressed out and overwhelmed and the other part is them being overstimulated and feeding off of our stress it's been a while since we've gotten a full week of school in but that doesn't mean they're not learning and we aren't doing things there are going to be seasons where opening up your curriculum feel so overwhelming and like such a burden but there are things that we can do to make sure they're still learning and still progressing without burning ourselves out my number one go to is learning apps my favourites are reading Eggs Night Zookeeper and I x L we do limit screen time so getting to play a game is a treat to them and I feel better knowing they're learning something another thing is audiobooks or read alouds on YouTube I like to practice listening comprehension with audiobook I'll ask questions about characters plot setting things like that in Canada as a reading activity and you can find read alouds on YouTube to cover topics like history and science another super easy thing to do is play games together I have a whole list of games on my Amazon storefront that cover all kinds of learning standards so your family can have fun playing games together and learning at the same time these are just some super simple ways to keep doing school while you're in a really busy season
