listen up is your man really the problem or are you being influenced by your single friends all single women generally want their friends to be single too so they can have fun together go out party go to the clubs Theyâ€™re gonna judge your partner because you can't just go out free willy nilly because A) you're in a relationship and B) it's disrespectful to your partner unless of course they're coming with but most women love to go out with just girls all I'm saying is you shouldn't let your single friends influence you and pay attention okay honestly the same can be said about men too if your friends are trying to influence you to break up with your partner pay attention are they single? is your partner really the problem or is it your single friends?
