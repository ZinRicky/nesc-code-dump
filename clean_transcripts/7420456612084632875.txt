it's spooky home school season and today we're working on a geology unit study to make this unit study even more interesting I'm gonna use a Declan's mining bucket these things are so freaking cool my kids absolutely love them this one is their raw rocks bucket and I think this one might be my favourite cause it's just so basic and it's perfect for this geology lesson my son is so excited for this lesson today also check out their store because they have some really cute Halloween buckets right now and I still wish I got one of those instead all their buckets come with their own field guide and this is so cute they're a family company I love support in this company love their buckets if you have a kid that is into geology right now or just loves rocks I would highly suggest this for a birthday or Christmas present it's absolutely amazing click the link in this video to grab yours today
