roll call who saw my first anti anxious station and who saw that concept blow up I was kinda surprised if I'm honest because what started out as an inside joke that I had with myself ended up helping me and a whole bunch of other people you might know that BraveFace has been a staple of my anti anxious station for almost two years now and I'm so excited because we've teamed up and also looped in a couple of my other favourite local brands so that you can easily curate a calming and uplifting little space with the sole intent and purpose of making you feel fkn fabulous you can pick and choose which products you like to add to your bundle and whether or not youâ€™d like the tray and I must admit the four words on the tray were the hardest four words I've ever written like how difficult to encapsulate your entire ethos into one short sentence?! But I have this theory in life that the things that actually terrify you are the things that you need to run towards and for an anxious person that's hard so this serves as a twice daily reminder to keep showing up for yourself and to keep doing brave things word to the wise don't get the brave face cool head and the calm mood face mist confused the face mist acts like therapy and reminds me to feel calm and all the Brave Face products are taken orally so that you absorb those active ingredients top it all off with a feel good smoked lavender candle it's all limited edition and just went live right now
