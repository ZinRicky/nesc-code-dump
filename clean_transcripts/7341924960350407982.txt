How do sober people date? like I just feel like that's really hard to do. this past year I decided to quit drinking um, and I have given myself Grace I've probably drinking like once or twice. But that being said, it got me thinking. how do sober people date? back when I was dating I think there were always drinks involved. like those things just usually go hand in hand I'm spoken for now, but when I first met my man our dates definitely revolved around alcohol, or having a Margarita on Taco Tuesday, or having a glass of wine on our date. Obviously that's not an issue now because you know, we like each other, we've gotten to know each other. we like each other without drinking. but how do sober people do it? how do sober people work up the courage to get to know someone, when there's no drinks involved? it's definitely not easy, and I can kind of relate to this. because ever since I quit drinking, and I put myself in situations where I have to meet new people, it can be challenging. granted it’s not in an intimate way of finding a new partner, but it's usually in circumstances where I have to meet new people or when I'm trying to make new friends. it’s so awkward like, you're gonna have anxiety. meeting new people is kind of scary you know? you want them to like you, you wanna put on a good face, and put on a good impression. but that's just how life is you're supposed to feel those emotions you are a human being. this is normal. and once you understand this, meeting new people becomes a lot easier. so if you're dating or meeting new people, accept that you're gonna be nervous, instead of relying on all call to be someone you're not.
