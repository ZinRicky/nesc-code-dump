what do homeschoolers do at 8:00am they make their own breakfast of course that's a lie normally they're still asleep but for some reason my kids got up at 7:00am this morning and we're ready for breakfast by last year I gave them the responsibility of getting their own breakfast I do snacks lunch dinner all of things they can get their own breakfast in my daughter Learned how to make eggs and then we always have easy breakfast things on hand like cereal muffins bananas yoghurts those types of things but this morning they wanted to learn how to make scrambled pancakes so Mama had to usually only have to help them two or three times before they can do it on their own this has really saved me as a homeschool mom because so much of their day to day responsibilities fall on and this has been an easy way for me to have a slow and quiet morning and they have some responsibility for this but this didn't just happen overnight it took a lot of time and practice of learning things in the kitchen but also learning about food that feels their body because we all know that when mom is not on top of it they are gonna grab the sugary treats and all of the junk so for one we just don't buy that stuff so it's not a temptation and 2 I taught them about proteins and fats and nutrients and all the things that make our bodies feel good most of us who grew up in the 90s and early 2 surrounded by diet culture have a bad relationship with food and that's not something I want my kids to ever experience and even now we're learning so much about all of this crap that's in our food and how it's all bad for us but that is a conversation for another we put a huge emphasis on fruits veggies and animal products in our house and that's just naturally what our kids go I have no idea how I got down that rabbit hole but I just hope that you all have a fantastic Wednesday
