If you wanna make everyone fall in love with you.. here's what you should do! this one thing will help you make friends and build stronger connections with other people. When people first meet other people and they're trying to have a conversation they'll either go one of two routes A) they relate it back to themselves or B) ask a question about what they just told you People think that relating things is a good thing, but here's why it's actually not. When you wanna get to know people that's not actually what you want to do You wanna talk about them. Most people love talking about themselves people love to hear their name they love to brag if you allow someone to do this they'll fall in love with you Next time someone is trying to share something about themselves to you instead of relating it back to yourself try asking them questions for example if someone said they really enjoyed their dinner last night Instead of saying “oh, I did too I really liked my dinner last night” what you can do instead is ask some questions what did you cook? did you order out? what kind of food was it? what did you really like about it? Stop relating everything back to you if you want to really get to know people and build stronger connections Because people love to talk about themselves It’s the easiest way when you meet someone go up to them and ask them questions it'll make them feel seen, heard and you'll make them feel truly special that is the key to building strong connections in your life.
