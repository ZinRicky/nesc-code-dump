You probably didn't realise this but your type is the best looking guy or the best looking girl your type is the person you can be your absolute goofiest self with When you reminisce about the times you laughed the most and the times you were the goofiest with those are your type of people not the person that looks the best those people are more your type than any good looking person Thereâ€™s no better feeling than finding someone who is equally goofy and compatible with you that's what it's all about when we fall and mutual compatibility with someone when we fall and mutual goofiness or silliness with someone we call that love finding somebody who gets you and is on the same wavelength as you is what it's all about that's what everyone is looking for it's not about perfect and it's not about having money but being your truest silliest, goofiest self the person who doesn't judge you the person who lets you be you and loves you for it everybody needs at least one person who they can laugh with and be goofy with and they don't judge you for it you should always be comfortable around the ones you love you'll know when it's real because you can be your absolute self around them and they're right there cheering you on or they're being equally goofy with you now obviously attraction is still important but at the end of the day what really matters most is having someone that you can have a connection with and having someone understand you for you Next time you're in a situationship or relationship ask yourself this can I be my absolute goofiest self with this person without them judging me? understanding this will save you so much time when looking for your right type
