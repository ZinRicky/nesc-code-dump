right now I feel like we're having a lot of conversation with the 4B movement and how like Korean women as a result of the way that Korean men have been acting towards them have created this movement right but when people like Americans talk about you know Korean culture Korean music like whatever you're not in the comments saying oh Korean men red flag like why would you say that every single person that I have spoken to from some type of ethnic or cultural racial minority they will say that the men from my group they red flag look I don't I red flag right and I fully understand that right and I have definitely had issues with Arab men I'm not saying there's no issues with Arab men there definitely are but to comment this under a video where I'm talking about the beauty that I find in Arab culture and how this community of Arab people specifically Arab men help this man when he was homeless and like made sure that he was fed and you felt the need to comment most Arab men red flag like why did you feel the need to say that especially in the United States post 9 11 and now post October 7th like Arab men are consistently being villainized right like and again I'm not saying that that there aren't issues there are I just unless you are Arab tread lightly I would say cause like I don't know this just felt weird because I feel like again every person that I'm friends with from any other culture will tell you the shit about their own men and how their own men act right the issue is not just Arab men it's not that Arab men have a very specific issue with misogyny they can definitely be misogynistic but that is a trait of men in general right men of all cultures have an issue with misogyny all of them I don't care I don't care what country you're from I don't care what religion ethnicity whatever men from your group probably have like the typical man that you're thinking of probably has some misogyny that he has to deal with so just again tread lightly
