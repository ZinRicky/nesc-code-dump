my favorite thing is millennials using this filter or like trying a middle part and being in complete and utter denial they're like no this isn't right is not gonna look good and then they do it like they fix their brows look like this or they go from a side part to a middle part and like this doesn't look right this doesn't look good and all the comments are like girl you look 10 years younger you look amazing and then all the rest of the videos after that are them either with like the new brows or the new part or whatever and it just like it my favorite trend on this app I genuinely love it so much also my brows already look like this
