My wife and I get matching nails and a lot of you guys are really upset with it I don't know man. I don't mean to sound like super old school about this or anything but bragging about going with your wife to get your nails done like how are you supposed to protect her and provide for her and be the kind of man she needs when when you can't even do your own nails you know what's that? Oh, he's gonna gel they get gel manicures oh oh oh never mind man. I take leave that shit to the professionals yeah, you doing it right? Never mind.
