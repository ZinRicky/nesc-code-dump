men taking selfies is now an “ick” I don't understand that, how is men taking selfies an “ick” I saw a couple videos of people explaining why they think it's an ick but I don't agree, in fact, if I like you or wanna pursue you, I wanna see you. I want you to share your day with me, with your selfies or pictures of what you're doing. I don't think that's an ick it brightens my day that you wanna share your day with me the person in this video goes on to explain why they think it's an ick and they think that it's because it makes them look like they're too into themselves or too feminine which I don't agree. don't you want a man that's confident? I don't see that as feminine. especially in the beginning, like if I like you I wanna see you and learn more about you and me send selfie of your outfit of the day, you at the gym, or what you're doing. I love that! it's gonna determine if I like you or if I like your style now the second explanation that they gave is that they think that the person is fishing for compliments/ or because he's insecure so that's what he wants now men don't necessarily need validation but it's so important to show interest in him or his life and if you're not into it you can still acknowledge that he's interested in it and it means something to him that’s basic human decency so no, I don't think that's cringy or an ick if a man that you like wants to send you a selfie or share what they're doing throughout the day this is the age we're living in I welcome it, like yes send me a selfie! share what you're doing with me! I love that and I live for that! I don't know, call me crazy.. what do you guys think?
