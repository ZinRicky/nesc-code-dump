I'm gonna start this series that we're gonna call trauma Tuesdays because on Tuesday I meet with my therapist and I kinda feel like if I don't kinda make light and bring humor out of these situations I'm gonna just get depressed and honestly I didn't know that what I was going through was considered trauma it was just normal to me because that's what my whole life had been so I think by sharing my story and some of the things that I have gone through and also like what I'm working through now because I am learning that a lot of my autoimmune disease has been brought on by store trauma in my body so maybe people who have gone through similar experiences I have can get help faster or kind of identify some of those things in yourself so little backstory I grew up in an alcoholic home where there was a lot of physical and verbal abuse and just forced to carry a lot of burden that I was never meant to I was also put in a lot of situations from a very early age that really no child should ever experience as an adult I am very very triggered by alcohol I cannot drink it I have a physical response in my body from drinking alcohol I do not like the smell of it it's so triggering for me and I'm even triggered by like people's funny drunk stories but the worst part is that as I have been detoxing and healing my autoimmune disease I started having nightmares I had to pause for a cry but anyway in my nightmares I am reliving things that happened to me as a child except I'm not the kid it's happening to it's my own children and I'm kind of like watching it all happen like a movie and that was the moment I realized that I had a ton of childhood trauma that I needed to work through in order to continue healing my body and that's what I'm working through therapy because I do not want to continue to be triggered by things that literally aren't even happening to me like the last time I had a trigger was someone else telling me about a funny dream that they had and it LED me down a spiral rabbit hole for no reason and I want to be able to live my life and not have triggers and not be afraid that something is happening to my kids when they grew up in a totally different family dynamic than what I did
