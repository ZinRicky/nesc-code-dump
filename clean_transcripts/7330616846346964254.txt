this video is not about this particular person but it's about transplants in general to New York let's get one thing straight $100,000 is enough to survive in New York she says $100,000 is not enough to thrive what are you doing that $100,000 is not enough for you to survive in New York City and I go to her comment and I see that she likes hiking swimming golfing being in nature why are you coming to New York that I just like I don't get it I'm not trying to hate on this particular person but she's like you know I've always wanted to do it I tried it for a year like should I stay or should I go go again I know that sounds harsh but like you don't have to be here if you don't wanna be here so many people move to New York City and they have this idea of what New York City is supposed to be and they think that somehow it's gonna be like the most magical thing that they see in TV and like this is a city this is a city where people live and work and like have families and it's like you are not going to come to New York and like automatically become a different person you can become like a new person you can change you can grow if you want to but if you know that you are a person who likes nature who likes hiking who likes going like golfing why are you moving to New York City go to Florida go come on go somewhere else but like why are you coming to New York and trying to make it something that it's and it's really frustrating for me because like my parents met in Brooklyn I was born in Brooklyn my dad still works in Brooklyn I went to school here in Manhattan my parents friends my family friends are all in New York my community is here right I'm not going anywhere and if I do I will eventually be back because this is home base like this is this is where my home is and I'm watching so many people so people that I've known personally being priced out of New York City and the boroughs in general because of people who come here and think that New York is some fairytale land where they can live out the main character fantasy for a few years and then leave and it just it gets frustrating if you call me a hater call me a gatekeeper yeah it's just frustrating like not to mention I'm fat New York City is genuinely the only place in the entire world I have ever felt at home and comfortable in my body and I don't feel like I'm being judged for my appearance obviously now and then I still get shitty comments from people in New York but I cannot explain how like when I go elsewhere I literally am looked at as I'm like like like I'm some kind of like freak I'm not exaggerating when I say that when I leave New York City people are staring at me in the street like obviously I look cunt and cool and fun that's part of but also I'm fat as long as you're not bothering anyone and you put on a good outfit and you walk outside in confidence like New York is going to be kind New York has always been kind to me when I walk outside elsewhere literally cannot express the kind of looks that I get I don't have another place to feel safe outside of New York I'm not going to leave the city I can't but if you don't wanna be here you do not have to be here if you wanna go hiking if you wanna go out in nature go do that New York is a real city where real people live I understand that like every movie is now set in New York and like for some reason every student went to NYU I went there it was good it was fun but like calm down but things only happen in the city if you let them happen if you like the city if you love the city it's going to love you back but if you don't feel like you're thriving here and you're not from New York you don't have to stay because for a lot of us this is home
