spring has officially sprung here in Aotearoa, New Zealand and if you're anything like me the warmer weather will compel you to deep clean absolutely everything you can find and if you don't know where to start here are my Top 5 Spring Cleaning Tips or if you’d prefer not to start you can just stay here and watch me do it promise I won't tell the first area I like to tackle is the windows because I live in an older damp home with a dog and 3 kids Four, if you count my husband I use my Karcher Window Vac cause it makes short work of the job and it leaves me with a streak free finish bonus points if you clean your windows inside and out make sure you open everything up afterward to allow that fresh air to circulate throughout your home and if you're in the mood steam clean or launder your window treatments now time for a sit down just kidding cause this couch is actually filthy we spend a lot of time cosy up here over winter all Netflix and zero chill I have “no food on the couch rule” in this house so can someone please tell me why it's covered in crumbs I'm going in with my trusty Karcher VC 7 cordless vacuum with a brush attachment to debulk the crumbs and then I get into all the corners using the detailing attachment Once it was looking brand new again I put the couch back together but I quickly realised that my work here is not done because there's evidence of an unauthorised dog sitting here and also chocolate which is suspicious if you refer back to my one and only couch rule so I really need my Karcher Battery Spot Cleaner to come through for me today I knew it would make short work of the marks and scuffs but I was a little nervous about their chocolate stain if I'm honest because it's chocolate right and also let's just say it's not a new stain but honestly I don't know why I was nervous cause it came right out but that just made me mad that I've spent the last 2 months looking at it now if you know me and you follow me my 3rd spring cleaning tip will not surprise you in the slightest and that is to steam clean all of the commonly used services throughout your home because nothing screams “I'm okay emotionally” quite like steam cleaning everything you can see but I like it cause it's quick and effective and it kills germs without harsh chemicals focus on things like cabinets walls floors and skirting board and pay extra attention to high touch spots like doorknobs and light switches and if you're anything like me your steamer will become your new BFF your ride or die and your confidant one thing about me that you might not know is I would really like to take a sledgehammer into the bedroom to demolish it, obviously, because we're renovating but I can't do that right now but what I can do is clean it cause in winter dampness dust and allergens love to get cosy in here so strip your bed deep clean all of your linens and you can even steam clean your mattress bonus points for getting the mattress into the sun for a double disinfectant then you wanna pull out all of the furniture and clean in under and around and I figured while I was here I may as well steam the skirting boards the walls the headboard the lights light switches and Window Vac the windows but I promise you there is nothing in this world that will match the feeling of hopping into a clean bed with clean bedding in a clean room with clean everything honestly you will sleep so good and I would really like to hop into it right about now but first I've got a bone to pick with this Kowhai tree and I'm gonna put the new Karcher Eco Booster 180 water blaster attachment to the ultimate test and basically it sprays a 50 percent wider surface area which is great for me because at this time of the year me and this Kowhai tree are at war and if you don't already know the Kowhai is one of our national treasures it bursts into life in early spring with these gorgeous yellow flowers our special native bird such as Tui we love to feast on them and the word Kowhai actually means yellow in Māori It’s easily one of my favourite natives but just as quickly as those flowers come they drop all over my path So my final spring cleaning tip is to get outside and clean your paths pavers entries and exits and I'm going for progress over perfection today cause I know I'm gonna be spending more time out here over the next few months spring cleaning is unavoidable but it can be quick easy and fun with Karcher
