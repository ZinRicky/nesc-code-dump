as a fat person I struggle with overconsumption Iâ€™m talking about shopping I have such a love for clothing and fashion but because I'm a larger fat person it's really difficult to find clothing that I like in my size growing up there is almost never clothing that I wanted to wear in my size so in the last few years we've made progress in plus size clothing so when I find clothes now that I like and like they're making things that I wanna wear I immediately jump on it and I buy it because being fat sometimes just clothing items that I've never seen and never thought will be made in my size and I don't know if like it's gonna last if it's gonna be sold out if they're gonna make it again but the problem with that is sometimes I end up buying things that I don't end up wearing and like I have no use for but I'm like I wanna buy it just like in case I need it and I really wish that I could be more intentional with the way that I shop but we've literally seen in the last few months how plus size clothing is being kind of walked back like stores that were like oh hey I'm size inclusive are now like just kidding and like we're seeing in real time like my fear the one that I was having is valid and it's like how do I combat that over consumption when I know there genuinely is a real possibility that item might literally never exist ever again and also so I'm the type of person where like I'll find something that I really like and I'll just wear it consistently like at least once a week you know what I mean like very very often I'm like a cartoon character like I have like my you know my set outfits right but the clothes are also not made well like plus size people often don't really get good quality like options you know so there's like of course they're gonna run through quickly especially if you're wearing them often and so now I'm in a position where like if I have something that I like and I like get the use out of it and I wear it it it'll be like unwearable in a few years and I don't even have the option to pay more to get a better quality garment that will last like a lifetime so I have literally no choice I'm sitting here like debating rebuying this like black velvet dress that I like that I wear all the time but the straps are already like peeling off and I might like I'm gonna sew it just like to get more use out of the dress but like uh it's so frustrating like literally either my choices are like buy three of the same dress that you like so you know you will have it or just like wear it till it falls apart because it's gonna fall apart because they don't make quality clothes for plus size people oh my god ugh anyway and I'm an anti capitalist like I I inherently do not support over consumption but I am an over consumer when it comes to fashion and like shopping because of this exact reason and I'm not gonna get into how expensive this is like it is a privilege to be able to rebuy the clothes that I want but like it's just it's not fair it's not fair that we have to do that like these like fast fashion cheap clothes are not a problem just for fat people it's a problem for everyone but thin people can at least go to like a thrift store and get old vintage like quality made clothes but like obviously I as fat person cannot do that so I'm literally at a thrift store I am sitting in a parking lot at the store making this rant because I'm so I'm so like upset about this whole situation so I don't this is also why plus size people get mad at thin people who take plus size clothing from thrift stores because like obviously it's a thrift store first come first or whatever do what you want but also there's so little of it that actual plus size people can't shop at thrift store sucks I literally sent my sister in and I'm like I'm gonna go in at the end to look at the jewelry and like the three pieces that are in my size because obviously obviously there's no vintage plus size clothing so anyways
