Find the type of love where, when you're watching a show he pauses it without you even having to ask. that's true love! they consider you enough to not want you to miss an experience that you guys can both share together they love you! or maybe they're sick of the fact that when you come back and he didn't pause it you're like what happened?? what I miss?? and then he has to pause it. either way that's true love right there
