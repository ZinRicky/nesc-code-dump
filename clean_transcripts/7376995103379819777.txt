an Indian airline is giving female travellers the option to choose to sit next to other women and the question is do you think this is a good idea and do you think this is something that could be implemented globally for me 100% and I'm gonna share with you why I've been sexually assaulted once on a plane and sexually harassed once on a plane both by men who were sitting next to me the first time I fell asleep on a plane and I woke up and the man who is sitting next to me had his hands between my legs it was on Caribbean Airlines and it was a flight from New York to Guyana I think it was about a 4 or 6 hour flight it felt like forever I noticed that this man sitting next to me was creeping me out and even though we were sitting next to each other he was just staring at me like staring right at me and so I ignored him I always fell asleep on flat so then I fell asleep um and woke up looked down and his disgusting hands were literally in between my thighs can you imagine like I froze fight flight or freeze and I absolutely froze I didn't know what to do because I was stuck in the window seat with two more seats between me and the aisle so I knew that if I wanted to get out I would have to like squeeze past him or if I wanted to get help I'd have to talk over him to an attendant it was a really compromising position I felt really stuck I was quite young and I didn't really know what to do I wasn't familiar with the airline or the culture of the airline like it wasn't like I was in Australia and I knew exactly what to do either it was awful I then crossed my legs and moved as far over as I could towards the window and kind of went like that and tried to kind of and he moved his hand and then I spent the rest of the flight just completely frozen and like awake and not moving the second time was Korean Airlines flight over to the States and the air attendants like the flight attendants kept serving this man more and more wine like he drank like 20 glasses of wine or more on this flight and he just got drunker and drunker and started leering and staring at me harder and harder and it was just gross I can't even explain it was just awful and those women like that were the flight attendants didn't even look at me didn't even acknowledge me like just kept serving him I hated it it was weird ever since then I've always will for a few years after that I requested to sit next to women but I felt really strange doing and they didn't always let me kind of request that they acted like it was a strange request but having had that experience I just I hated it I'd never wanted to be put in that position again so yeah I think it's absolutely something that should be normalised that we provide that as a normal option for women and because there are very good reasons like uh in she's a crowd starterbase we have several stories that are from aeroplanes we've spoken to Qantas about this they are aware of this issue as well and I'm sure I'm not the only one because any space there are opportunistic predators who are going to make the most of overcrowding or women who are isolated in the sky stuck on a plane like I can't think of really anything worse to be honest in terms of public transport um harassment so good good job to this airline and I really do hope that we see um follow through from other airlines as well I actually just literally remember the third time when it was actually the pilot who did it but I've already told that story and that is a whole story time in another self yeah what do you think
