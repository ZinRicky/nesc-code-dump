okay seriously please pause and read this comment women need to be very clear with what's happening since we've been able to work men have been financially abusing us it's absolutely real it's all too common and I think the reason why women stay and stay longer and just keep pouring money and money and money after the same thing is you always think your situation is unique and it's not you're not unique it's not special he doesn't have this one off one in a million story that requires his partner to pour all of her money into his life that's not it's just not realistic you just have an abuser a manipulator somebody who should be in sales maybe but they definitely should not be taking another person's money to pay for their shit and like girls are just getting played hard but the more we keep the stories out there so women know number one your story is not special his story is not special these reasons for paying and all the mental gymnastics you're doing to justify all this money you're pouring out to this person um no it's just manipulation and lies and financial abuse is real
