I don't know if it's just me but I feel like this is the time of the year where most of us get burnt out because hear me out but it's been so long since Christmas break and yet we've still got all of the busy months to get through so I'm calling it Self Care September and honestly it's been so long since I've had a facial or any kind of pampering so I decided to treat myself to a luxurious Red Door spa service with Elizabeth Arden at Farmers and I might have been living under a rock but I had no idea that you could get an Elizabeth Arden facial at selected Farmers stores they do an express for 15 minutes or you can do a 60 or 90 minute facial and the cost of the booking is redeemable on products which I think is great my amazing aesthetician Jobyda decided I would benefit most from a Lift and Firm Ceramide Facial we started off with a double cleanse and an exfoliation before giving me a lifting facial massage with the Advanced Ceramide Capsules we did a face mask which was just so satisfying to peel off and then she used their unique Skintervention tool which I've never seen before but honestly I want one it used light and heat to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles leaving you with firmer and smoother skin I walked out of there feeling so relaxed and at this time of the year and for me at this time of the month I really needed that Jobyda show me what she used on me during my treatment and also recommended a couple of things that I should be using at home and one of them was these Advanced Ceramide Capsules which I've been using at home for over a year now and these are precise premeasured biodegradable capsules with high potency targeted actives and they feel absolutely beautiful on the skin
