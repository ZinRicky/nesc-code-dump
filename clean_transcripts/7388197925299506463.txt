Here you go, girly pop. The link is right here. This little orange thing. It should say African net sponge. Click it. Buy one if you don't want your loofahs to start growing vegetables out of them like traditional luffas can do. The African nut sponge. You can open it up, rinse it out. You can even machine wash it, and it lasts, I think, up to two years. Up to two years. And it's machine washable. And just in between, you can actually rinse it out yourself. Linked right here. It's amazing and I love it.
