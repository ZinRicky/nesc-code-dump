the day started with a yoga class cause it turns out if I don't not only am I a sore bitch I'm also just a bitch and cause I'm irrevocably deep in my handmaid's era at the moment the first thing I did when I got home was make bread praise be then I learnt that apparently I'm the only person who actually looks in the fridge in this house which means I'm also the only person who notices when it needs to be cleaned Blessed be the fruit vegetables and other things I keep in the fridge I was determined to not dedicate all of my spare time to the upkeep of my house today instead I just dedicated most of my spare time to the upkeep of the house today being a homemaker is so rewarding I'm not too sure yet what the reward is but one day when I figure it out rest assured you'll be the first to know actually I might have recently stumbled across one such reward my new toilet cleaner is pink and this fills me with a feeling that I can only assume normal people would describe as happiness anyway I absolutely could not be fkd cooking dinner tonight so I decided to throw it together in the afternoon so that when the evening rolls around it might actually feel like somebody else cook for me I'm trying out a new recipe which I'm affectionately calling “Chuck a whole lot of random shit in a pot cook it on low and hope for the best” we might need a workshop the name but a slow cooked meal is ideal because it frees me up to do other things like care for the children and maybe even tackle some of my husband's jobs and one thing I learnt through that experience is it's not actually that hard and dare I say it it's quite fun made even more fun by the fact that children don't dare bother you while you have loud machine in your hands Which leads me to conclude that the menfolk have been gatekeeping once again by the time I finished the housework the childcare and the yard work the dinner had largely cooked itself all I needed to do was pair a grain with it bake some bread and throw together a salad so really, not that much and then everybody requested pudding as they do almost every night so I put my daughter to work and together we whipped up a dark chocolate hazelnut self saucing pudding from scratch and it was absolutely fkn delicious if I'm honest and the dopamine from the chocolate made all of the day’s hard work almost feel worth it
