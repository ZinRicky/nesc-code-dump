I've been seeing this trend all over TikTok which says like social media is not real here are like some things that I'm struggling with so this is my version of that I'm not doing a carousel post because honestly I don't have the time which brings me to my thing um I'm an ADHD mom I was diagnosed with ADHD in third grade so I'm not a late in life diagnosi which although that's completely valid um I've just always known this about myself and it's always been my least favourite thing about me I have been medicated on and off since I was in third grade and if you wanna post explaining why I decided to get off medication around 24 and haven't been really medicated until like right about now I'm happy to do a post about that but I've just been adding responsibilities to my plate and jobs to my plate I now do content I added another child I am now homeschooling and I feel like I'm literally at some sort of breaking point in my just general ability to cope and it's because I'm ADHD mom I get overstimulated very easily um I have a really hard time staying on task have a really hard time staying organized and when I say this is my least favourite thing about myself it's not my least favourite thing about myself if it was just me it's my least favourite thing about myself as a mother and honestly it's because I feel like my kids deserve better they deserve someone who's so much more on top of their shit there's they deserve someone who can like do the Pinterest stuff I see all these moms who are like their houses are spotless and they have like the perfect themed craft all the time and they're just so engaged with their children because they've managed their time appropriately and I get that a lot of that is social media content and sometimes I do have to scroll away because like I understand as a creator that that is not just happening that that is planned content but I always feel like I'm trying to play catch up and I always feel like if I was just more organized if I could just complete my tasks in an efficient manner I would have more time to enjoy my kids because even when I do have childcare which I do I have tons of childcare like I should be better I use that time to catch up on all of the like chores and and errands and things that I just can't multitasking do and I don't know what the point of this post is other than to say the social media is not real and I'm extremely frustrated with myself and my own limitations and although I would never judge another person for being neurodivergent and and having trouble I judge myself for it like extremely harshly like I'll have bouts of manic episodes where I deep clean the house and I organise things and I and I'm super on top of my content and I'm posting everyday and I've got the comments and like then I'll just freaking burn out and I won't be able to do it anymore and I'm so grateful for the help that I have because I don't know how I would function I wouldn't but I get really sad and frustrated that I can't do it for myself social media is not real bye
