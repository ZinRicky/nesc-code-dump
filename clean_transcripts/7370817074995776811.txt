so I've been racking my brains about how to use all the eggs that we have right now the chickens are in full production and I have a lot of eggs to use though this Marans was being broody on a clutch of kinda raw eggs I let her hang out here for a few more days but her eggs are starting to smell she did have this cute little surprise but um this is the last of the chicks that she's hatching I'll be throwing the rest of the eggs away tomorrow and giving them one more chance to hatch one last chick so I'm gonna take these eggs into the kitchen and see what I can whip up and crepes so I'm gonna start off by making some chocolate sauce my kids love this anyway so I will be using this in other recipes to make chocolate milk chocolate ice cream but right now we're gonna just start off by using it to make our chocolate crepes crepes crepes I don't even know if I'm saying it right you know I grew up in Europe so you feel like I should know how to say it but I'm still saying crepes so this recipe called for about eight eggs I think about like 10 11 eggs and I can't really remember but I always end up using more eggs than a recipe called for that really does help get rid of some of the eggs throwing in some raw milk on the cow and give it a good whip up this is my grandmother's mixer and I will use it until the day I die make sure your cast iron skillet is nice and hot it will stick if your cast iron skillet is not hot well seasoned that is the first step at this point it was kind of a look at omelette and I just don't really like omelettes which is I think a great way to get rid of ice but maybe I need to retry the omelettes um I'm obviously not a savory person but these did not taste like omelettes they did actually taste like a white chocolate crepe which it taste like here I'm drizzling the chocolate sauce on this is absolutely a delicious sauce recipe I'm gonna sprinkle some powdered sugar on it and call it good the kids loved it the baby loved it and the mother in law loved it
