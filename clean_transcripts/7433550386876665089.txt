if you think I look like a mess you should see my house I've had a busy morning I started the day with a yoga class and I came home scooped up the kids and we went and ran some errands for a few hours on our travels we picked up some groceries as you do and unfortunately my fridge is at that point where you can't actually put new groceries in it without sorting it out normally I like to stay across the day to day jobs a bit better than this but when we're going hammer and tongs on a project I find it extremely difficult to juggle everything and I'm aware that realistically if I was working side by side with Mark in the pool right now we would be making faster progress but I also need what I call my mummy days I really need that one on one time with the kids and I also need time to kinda organise the house and get ready for the week ahead so I'm chopping up some fruit for the fridge because if I do this it'll get eaten and if I don't it won't I've also got two out of three kids sitting at the bench with me and chopping up fruit in front of kids as such a sneaky way to make them eat it I think a big part of motherhood is conquering the out of subtle manipulation because I've just popped a little bowl in front of them and the fruits there and wouldn't you know it they're just helping themselves side note but I found chopping that watermelon extremely fkn satisfying anyway another good thing about making up these fruit containers is at the end I'll just chop up some of the fruit a little bit smaller and then throw together a fruit salad these don't last five minutes in my house they're so yummy and we all love them it's time to put everything back in the fridge and I'm just gonna give you a warning now my fridge is not a content fridge okay my items stay in the packaging that I purchased them in and yeah I kinda wish that I decanted them into beautiful aesthetic jars but also I'm renovating I have 3 kids and I am at capacity okay but it's a normal functional family fridge and we love her fingerprints and all alright we're on the home stretch now I put away the rest of the groceries into the cupboard unloaded the bottom dish drawer and then got started on the dishes in the sink then it was time to give everything a really good wipe down can't forget the tap and I love the tap but the only downside of a tap with a motion sensor is that it's easier to turn on than my husband I gave the sink a really good scrub down and this I think is one of my favourite jobs I don't know how long you've been following me for but if you remember my old house you will know the lore about the white sink and saying goodbye to that sink was probably the saddest part about moving it took us a full year but I finally put a white sink into this place and you might have noticed that I haven't actually updated you on the kitchen renovation in a hot minute I was waiting for a few finishing touches to arrive and they finally did so I'll be posting that series in the next few days hopefully I say that but honestly don't be surprised if is it’s delayed because I just feel like I'm tryna do too many things at once at the moment and lowkey failing at all of them anyway I use the sleepy moppy thingy on the floor before vacuuming the rug and lighting a fk off candle and if you don't know what that is you just light a candle in an area that you've cleaned and it will tell everyone in your house to fk off mine smells like gingerbread There’s no better feeling for me than a clean space but then I remembered that now I have to make dinner and it was basically pointless
