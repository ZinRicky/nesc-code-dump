people have forgotten what Donald Trump was like in October of 2016 and that difference of how he was campaigning Then and now terrifies me let me explain in October of 2016 you could not get away from Donald Trump he was everywhere he was tweeting constantly he was constantly doing interviews he was everywhere you couldn't get away from him and it was the worst Hillary Clinton actually talks about this in her book What Happened and talks about how she she couldn't even talk about policy or couldn't get any word in because he was just absolutely saturating all of the media coverage of the election this October is nothing like that his campaign knows that they need to lean into Trump amnesia they want people to go into the polls and think I feel like I had more money from him and not remember how absolutely insane every single day was when he was president so that they will go in have Trump amnesia and have a greater likelihood of voting for him basically his campaign understands that the more he talks the worse it is for him and we need to acknowledge how absolutely messed up that is declining debates and at a recent Q&A and out of taking questions he made everybody listen to music for 30 minutes I can't even make this stuff up and in his campaign know that the more he talks the more people will be reminded of who he actually is and not vote for him America
