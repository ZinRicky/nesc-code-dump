this will ruffle up some feathers I truly believe to my core if a man is willing to buy a woman an expensive ring engagement ring whatever it may be and the woman should equally spend money on him should equally give the man an expensive gift other words a suit nice shoes a classy y likely able to get all of these things it still won't be as expensive as engagement rings are these days I don't know what do you guys think
