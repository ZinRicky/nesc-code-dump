my late nan was the type of woman who could throw together an incredible meal with seemingly nothing in the cupboard and my favourite was always her Galette and my take on her recipe is gonna be my submission to the Wattie’s 90th birthday cookbook if you wanna submit your own Wattie’s Creation check the caption A galette is like a free form tart you can make it sweet or you can make it savoury I start by making the dough wrapping it up before popping it in the fridge to chill while I get started on the filling then we slice three red onions before popping them into a heated oil pan and sauteing with some brown sugar and balsamic vinegar until they start to caramelise to that I add some Wattie’s Free Flow Spinach and give it a few minutes until it's all cooked Then you wanna roll your dough out into a rough circle and the best thing about this dish is the more rustic it looks the better so it doesn't need to be perfect pile on your filling leaving a bit of a border around the edge and I'm topping that with a can of Wattie’s Sliced Beetroot toasted walnuts, feta and a drizzle of honey or hot honey if you're feeling spicy and then you wanna kind of fold the pastry in to create almost like little pleats brush it with an egg wash bake it and then top with fresh thyme this dish is quick easy and flavoursome and you can find the full recipe down below
