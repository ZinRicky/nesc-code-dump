one of the hardest things about being a stay at home parent when you have a partner that works outside the home is the fact that at the end of the day when you guys come back together your needs because of what you've done all day are completely different my husband comes home he wants to vent he wants to grape he wants to complain he wants to give me the tea he wants to tell me what happened with his death he vents his frustration he uses me as a way to like emotionally regulate I on the other hand have been crawled on maybe spit at snarked at I rolled and been absorbing negativity from my children all day long because I'm respectful parenting I am trying to regulate my child's negative emotions in a peaceful way that takes an extraordinary amount of emotional labour and mental effort so when he gets home at the end of the day I want to turn off I want to lay like a potato I want to listen to nobody's questions and nobody's complaints so getting back into the group with each other has proven a little bit difficult recently since our two year old has started his uh difficult period which is why it is always so important to check in with your partner and see what their needs are and where their bandwidth is at because some days I have more patience and Grace throughout the day I just have more bandwidth and some days by the end of dinner I am done I can take no one else's nothing it is a crawl uphill to get to bedtime maybe we need one of those like coasters the green and red like you have it like Brazilian steakhouses where I'm like okay I'm ready I can take on all of your vents and your and and all of your complaints for the day tell me all about it and other days I'll be like the red absolutely not this is this is not the place for this is not the place for it today
