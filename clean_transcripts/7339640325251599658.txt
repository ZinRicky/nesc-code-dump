This has been my favorite late night snack lately. It's currently 10:30, but I needed something sweet before I got ready for bed, so this is what I decided to make. Look at that. I popped some popcorn, melted down some marshmallows and butter in my pan, and then tossed in my popcorn again. Added some cinnamon and some marshmallows on top. So good!
