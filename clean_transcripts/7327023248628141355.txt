Earlier today, I wrote my husband a note asking him to surprise me with dinner reservations, and he did! He asked a few New York locals what their favorite spots were and then picked one, made a reservation, and here we are at the Monkey Bar. I loved how cozy the atmosphere was. If there's mocktails on the menu, we get the mocktails. I didn't like the one I ordered, so lucky traded me even though he didn't like mine either, but his was really good. We got some artichoke dip and vodka pasta for starters. Vodka pasta was very mediocre. Make better vodka pasta so I wasn't impressed. But lucky ended up finishing off the pasta and the dip because I limited myself to only eating a little bit cause I knew I wouldn't be able to have my main if I had more. We both got steaks and then I got some creamy mushrooms and buttery garlic mashed potatoes with it while he got some French fries with his. My favorite thing were the mushrooms. They were so good with the steak key. Having steak with ketchup felt criminal, but it was a lot better than it looked. I was in a food coma at this point and I couldn't finish my food, so lucky had the rest. I still needed something sweet so we got some ice cream and headed back to the hotel.
