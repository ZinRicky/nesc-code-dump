did you guys know that talking about your problems will only make them grow? the number one symptom of depression is the pathological obsessing of your own pain instead you should exercise not only is it chemically good for you because your body will release natural endorphins but it's also good for your mental health, or running errands getting out of the house and accomplishing anything is good for you But sitting around talking and thinking of your own problems is not good for you, it's a poor coping skill. Some of the most successful therapists will try to break that poor coping skill whereas unsuccessful therapist will rather indulge that behaviour Granted when we're struggling or going through problems the last thing we wanna hear is suck it up, But we probably should be more accepting about hard truth studies show that if you regularly obsess over your pain or emotions, You feel worse basically what you put energy to is what grows What do you think? should we all learn how to suck it up and put energy towards positive things? or should we indulge in our emotions and obsess over our feelings?
