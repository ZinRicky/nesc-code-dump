My sister has been staying at her house for a few weeks now and she usually does not have a preference on what we eat as long as it's vegetarian, but today she told me she was craving potato gnocchi, so I obviously had to make her some right away. I baked my potato until soft, grated my tomatoes, chopped up some onions, sliced up some garlic. I sauteed my onion with some basil until it was soft, added in my garlic, and let that go for a couple more minutes before adding in my grated tomato. I seasoned with some salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, let that simmer while I mashed up my potato. I made sure there were no clumps, and then it was time to get my gnocchi going. I combined some flour with the potatoes, some eggs, salt, and as soon as it came together, lucky needed it until it was smooth. Once it came together, I cut it into smaller pieces to roll out. I rolled out my dough into little ropes before cutting it into bite size pieces and transferring it over to a flowered baking tray. I let them boil for about a minute or two until they floated to the top, toss them in my sauce, and they were done. This dish is so simple but so good. I top it with a bunch of Parmesan cheese and it's absolutely divine.
