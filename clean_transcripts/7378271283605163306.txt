come along as we update our 1950s ranch home patio my husband cut down some pine trees that were dead which totally opened up the space and we had this porch overhang whatever you wanna call it and um it was rotted so we decided to tear it down which was the best choice we ever made because it totally brighten up the house and the patio I pressure washed the concrete patio and decided to paint it I went with the color artichoke by Valspar um I didn't want to go too light or too dark cause this patio gets pretty dirty I think artichoke was a perfect color choice because it's not super dark and it will hide the dirt and it's a bright airy color that I think will look best with the exterior of her home if you follow along next we are staining our brick home which will be a very long and fun process
