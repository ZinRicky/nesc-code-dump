here's some questions I have for men on behalf of all women we would all love to know number one: do you ever fancy having children? like do you in your head pick out their names and how you would dress them?(not in a creepy way) or do you does that not happen? okay number two/ how can women make men feel safe when labeling a relationship? Be honest how can we not scare you off, guys do you even know? Number 3: why can you never find things that are right in front of you? like do you just need help from us all the time or.. I what what's the reason we need to know we'd all love to know. why can you never find things?? No. 4 why don't you ever show sad emotions? like when was the last time you cried in front of someone especially? like do you do men cry? as a woman I think I cry a bare minimum once a month like do you guys cry? do you want to cry? I'm curious on behalf of all women, we would just love to know the answers please!
