I think that it is truly unfair how men can wake up in the morning and look as handsome as can be it’s not fair! okay us women okay not all but we put in work to look young Youthful, energized for the day If I don't put on makeup people are constantly asking me “are you okay?” meanwhile my husband rolls out of bed Doesn’t do anything maybe puts some hair gel brushes his teeth and he is good to go he is looking fine as hell it's not fair
