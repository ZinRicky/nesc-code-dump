Kicking off the Halloween weekend, right, we took our big kids on a Old South carriage tour. Ghost tour of Charleston. Believe it or not, me and my husband have never done this, and this was the perfect opportunity and such a fun way to start off our Halloween weekend. Tour was about 40 minutes, and we took our big kids, who are 8 and 9. And honestly, it was perfect for kids. Telling all of the creepy ghost stories from some of Charleston's most historic buildings. It was also just a beautiful way to see Charleston all lit up at night. The kids had such a great time, and so did my husband and I. I really do think this is going to be a new family tradition. To start off every Halloween weekend. Happy Halloween.
