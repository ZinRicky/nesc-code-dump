figuring out your style after becoming a mom is extremely difficult I know for me that it was a frustrating ongoing and long process going from a early 20 somethings who didn't really have her personal self figured out to begin with to a mom who is now home with her kids all the time but still wanted to feel good and confident in her body even for those of us who have like already established our personal style before entering motherhood a lot of the times the needs of your wardrobe changes your body proportions can change how you feel in different clothing and different silhouettes and different trends completely changes and shifts so I started a series a while ago talking about how to find your style after motherhood because I know I didn't have anyone kind of guiding me through it it was something that we just didn't really talk about because we're no longer the target demographic for a lot of fashion advertising the lot of the clothes that we have in our closet that they have worked or felt good before kids just don't for some reason work anymore we kind of gotta start over and start deciding what works for now you know I was very much a basics tops and jeans skinny jeans millennial kinda girl and even when I started experimenting we didn't we didn't go too far from the uniform at that point and you know there's nothing wrong with dressing like this if this is how you feel comfortable and confident but I felt neither of those things I was just putting clothes on my body to be as unnoticeable and and disregarded as possible because I didn't know how to express myself on the outside the person I wanted to be on the inside and the transformation has been significant if you're on the same sort of journey if you want to start feeling more confident in your body feeling confident in how you present yourself to the world start with the series that I have on my page follow along and we're gonna go through this together on the ways that I found my way into dressing the way I feel confident and expressing myself through clothing in a way that makes me feel um alive fun confident sexy proud of my body proud of myself and has brought so much like self confidence to me in motherhood
