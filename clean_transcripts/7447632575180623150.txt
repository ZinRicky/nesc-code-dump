Gonna go to bed. Last night, I could not stop thinking about a matcha that had a Poppy in it. I don't know why, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. And then it LED me to TikTok, and I was like, has anyone tried this? Has anyone done this? And a few people have, but I haven't. And so the fact that other people have tried it and they had a good experience made me feel good about trying it. So we're going to do a strawberry, lemon, Poppy with some matcha in it today. Let's give it a go. Not much. Let's mix it up and give it a try. I can taste the matcha. It's really good. This would be, like a perfect summery drink. I think that it's also missing a little something. I think I might add a little maple syrup. That's really good. Okay. I think I wanna try it with, like, a. I got orange cream. I think the orange cream would be really good, but I'm not mad about this. Out of 10, I give it a seven and a half. I love trying new things with matcha. So, so fun.
