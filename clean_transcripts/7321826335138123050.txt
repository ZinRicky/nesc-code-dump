Here are some things that I meal prep to make my week a little easier. I had some ripe bananas that needed to be used, so the only right way to use them is making banana bread. This is a one bowl, super simple recipe, and it comes out perfectly moist every single time. I usually add some chocolate chips to it, but I didn't this time to make it a little bit more versatile. Then I got started on some whipped robus honey butter. This is so good on the banana bread, but even other things. So I added my robus to the melted butter and some honey and whipped it over ice until it got super creamy. Then I put it all in a little glass jar and put that away in the fridge. I've been loving carrot salad, so I decided to make a rainbow carrot salad because it stores really well and it can be put on anything. So I add some oil, vinegar, lemon, honey, some spices, cilantro, and I usually put this on toast with some cream cheese or even just on its own. It works in a lot of different ways. You guys know what time it is? As soon as you guys see me pull out those purple onions. We're pickling onions today. I slice them up really thin and then dissolve my sugar with some vinegar, salt, and water. Then I put all of that in a Mason jar, add some Pepper corn to it and put it away to rest. Today I decided to switch up my blueberry sauce to raspberry sauce. So I added my frozen raspberries to a pot with some coconut sugar and lemon. Let that reduce until it got to the thickness I wanted it to get. This is so good when it's warmed up on some vanilla ice cream. Last but not least, I wanted to just make a batch of chicken noodle soup. It comes in so handy! So I diced up all of my vegetables and then added them to the pot with some ginger, a lot of garlic and a sprinkle of turmeric. And half of this batch I popped in the freezer to thaw whenever I need.
