My natural hair is very curly when I started straightening it almost two years ago. I've always tried to keep it as healthy as possible. And one thing I used from the beginning is the K18 leave in Molecular Repair Hair Mask. I use about a pump, work it through my hair, let it sit, brush it out, and then go straight into blow drying it. I swear by this mask. It reverses heat damage, color damage, leaves your hair good as new. I'm always so surprised at how healthy my curls are after straightening my hair for the past two years. Finish it off with the K18 oil, and there we go.
