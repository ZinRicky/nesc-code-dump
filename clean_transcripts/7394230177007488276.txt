I just finished cleaning my house and I'd like it to stay that way so I figured the best course of action was to completely evacuate the city and go mess up somebody else's the ferry ride turned into a free whale watching expedition and I've never seen dolphins in this harbour so my inner child was squealing alongside my actual children we're heading to waiheke Island which if you don't already know is a small rock of the coast of Auckland here in Aotearoa, New Zealand and I'm lucky because my mum lives here so it's close enough to visit but also there's an ocean between us Just the way I like it the foot gag is unfortunately in my DNA and I was pleased I let my 5 year old convinced me she could pack her own essentials for the trip I wanna eat my dinner in peace later so we burnt off some energy at the beach it turns out even if you spend your entire life teaching your children not to throw sand they will, in fact, throw sand we should have named Goldie Ken because she thinks her job is beach and she takes it very seriously at this point I realised I possibly could have thought through my pre-dinner beach plan a little better cause by the time the youngins were tired out they were also wet sandy and starving and then Goldie just chewed through her lead so I was good and ready for that g&t
