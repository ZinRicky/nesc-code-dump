I share that I have serious contempt for children like I basically hate them so somebody who makes a lot of content about kids as people and society's treatment of children I wanna talk about this creator's video because she really does go in depth into the psychology behind why she has such an outward hatred and contempt her words for children even so far as like being afraid of hurting children and I think those of us who are child advocates kind of already knew that you know anybody who just can go online and blatantly say yeah I hate all kids y'all have some like serious unpacking to do because it should never be socially acceptable to come into a public platform and feel confident that enough people will agree with you that you can say that you outright hate a group of people simply for existing as that group of people because the reason people hate children are for behaving like children and this form of prejudice this form of bigotry is somewhat socially acceptable which is a problem and I think creators need to be very careful about how they go about having this conversation because if you are not having the conversation as somebody who's done the work how was gotten to the other side of these feelings and impulses and trauma triggers I think you are in fact possibly doing more harm two children as a group and people's opinions of children then you are good but that's just my opinion that also being said I think this doubles down my complete confidence that people who are breaking generational trauma cycles are not only breaking them for their own children they are then raising a new generation of people who are not going to be triggered by children if kids are allowed to be kids and are loved as children they will not grow up to hate children I hope this creator is in therapy and gets the help she needs it seems she is self aware but the problem is is there are too many people who have those feelings who are not self aware enough to go down this journey and you know existing in an echo chamber where the sentiment is fuck them kids um it just grows hate it's it's bigotry and it's not it's not something you should feel confident putting on the internet
