wrap it around I love this fabric basically like a French braid but it really don't go away regardless I usually like to just leave it so it stays put extra and wrap it around again okay I use the ones from Maine Label and then I like to grab another piece and add that to the hair so what I love is that you can wrap it around the back would definitely recommend and then bring it up and tie it into a little bow and wrap it around in the opposite directions you can remove the clip this might be confusing at first so I just thought I would quickly show you these kind of things just kind of get in the way the kind of towel material of the main label co once and then grab more hair at the back and wrap it around in the opposite direction and yeah super easy it definitely was confusing for me but it really only takes a couple of tries and you'll get the hang of it always find it a little hard at the ends now add a little bit more you always have two pieces of hair Co I have a discount code that I'll link both link on screen for you and now just continue until all of your hair is wrapped around the broad so I've had a few of you ask me how I do my heatless curls so basically if you knock on my door in the middle of the day and then into a knot or something to get it out of your face but yeah so that I have nice hair for when my husband gets home from work we get there and then just add the elastic to hold it in place like so so I start off by grabbing one little piece and wrapping it around and that's all there is to it and then now when I'm sleeping I like to just this is what I will almost always look like and then it'll just become super easy and just kind of second nature because your hair sticks to it now I'm gonna grab the little piece of hair from the back so it's a lot easier to wrap leave it like this cause I feel like it's comfier when I'm just going about my life around the house
