Ahoy-Hoy! my doormat's done but first we recap cause a few days ago I realised that my front door was kinda ugly and my house was covered in spiders which was definitely just one spider working overtime right? right!? anyway we're gonna skip over the part where I killed a plant sacrifice to the gods I suppose once I got up to this point it was time to paint my doormat I had a few questions about it so I'm gonna tell you loosely what I did I got a plain doormat from Mitre 10 and I bought some acrylic paints from Bunnings PS: those two must never know that the other one exists and I free handed a font to the best of my abilities which admittedly is not great but that's only cause I couldn't make a stencil cause my printer will only print if I pay subscription each month which I flat out refuse to do anyway I rubbed some knobs until they shined highly recommend then I sanded the door frame and I sanded the door and then I painted the door frame and I painted the door so painting the door was a surprise to me as well but when you look at something really close then you can see the imperfections and once you see them you can't unsee them and when you can't unsee them they will keep you awake at night and I had this leftover Dulux enamel paint from our lounge renovation called Lake Brunner and I always thought that my front door was blue which I liked but looking at it now I think it's more of a dusty grey I cut everything in and then when it was dry went over it all with a mini roller because we can't have any brush strokes but we can't stop there cause you know that one spider I told you about turns out it's not just one and I have a problem actually I have many problems but today we're gonna deal with the spider specific one and the most commonly recommended product in my comment section was called Miss Muffets Revenge and I bought it solely because I like the name and now that the paint on the doormat is dry I'm gonna seal it because I don't know it feels like the right thing to do Anyway, massive side note but Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone right and he wanted everyone to answer it by saying Ahoy-Hoy but his rival Thomas Edison wanted everyone to say hello but now only Mister Burns says Ahoy-Hoy, and I kinda wish we all said it anyway that was the before during and after and I know now I need to pave it but first I gotta get back to what I supposed to be doing
