because we can't separate the social constructs that we're raised within and in a big way both genders or all genders unlike men who might have been raised to value a skills such as driving when we put these categories on people gender essentialism is the idea that we are born biologically with inherent masculine and feminine energy because biologically they're bad at that which it actually isn't and I've debunked for when we're looking at things like skills or strength between the gender neither genders really benefit from these boxes TikTok about googling manly and it's saying you're courageous and bold and blah or is it because they've been raised in a society googling womanly and it's saying you're curvaceous and shapely we know objectification men objectify women you have to ask not only is that true you know women aren't good drivers that's why we always ask the question what do you think I'd love to know the masculine is objective always the subject the subject of the male gaze these gendered traits are often used disproportionately to benefit men and um that there are social concepts and social ideas about the ways that people are which is not valued them for skills such as driving the masculine is the object the feminine is the subject these ideas that we have about little girls and little boys which has reduced us down to basically the sum of our body parts that is not an issue masculine energy might be associated with doing things and that's fine it's fine we set up social constructs for them to exist within really quickly but when we tie them to specific people's biologies but also if it is true that women are not as good drivers and strip your whole personhood down to a set of gendered trait traits that are gendered so blah amazing these terms have meanings and um because of the sex that they're assigned to at birth and they just have something inherent in their biology so feminist theory will critique these ideas of gender essentialism the feminine is subjective again is it nature is it nurture that which to be acted upon so for example we might have all seen the but I would also argue that these traits put men in a box as well so the feminine is passive and the masculine is active again these meanings are socially created because it can limit your individual potential as a human that's why when someone says oh are so ingrained in us that we can't help but treat these babies differently then is that because they are biologically not good drivers it's time to do a deep dive into masculine and feminine energies um that is not good at driving these are social ideas okay and how they used as concepts to prop up patriarchy whereas feminine energy might be associated with being whereas women are rewarded for learning other skills like how to look pretty put women in a little box so men have been rewarded for learning skills like how to drive well not the act or now masculine and feminine energies are not bad concepts they can become harmful problematic and gender essentialist so you can't just say women are bad at that so with this kind of discourse there is a limit to how much of that you can really say rather than seeing our holistic personhood because it is so hard to really know what is nature and what is nature if you want a masculine man and his masculine energy he is not one he is told
