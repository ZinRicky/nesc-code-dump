if I had to choose between being alone in a forest with a bear or Donald Trump I would choose the bear every single time and I'm sure that there are millions of women across the country and the world uh I would argue who feel the exact same way because at least if the bear attacks me um he's not going to blame me for it or say that I was uh you know too ugly to attack which are things that Donald Trump has literally said and and the irony of ironies that I think is really important to point out is that you know women if there weren't men like Donald Trump in the world women actually would require Protection right so he's creating this role of protector for himself um but he's the cause of a lot of harm and and and
