the problems will never go away because the problems are what keep you in the relationship women stay in really shitty marriages or relationships because they feel this obligation that it's their job to take care of this man oh but the girl before him you don't understand what she did to him you don't understand the kind of life he had growing up everybody has shit that happened in their life go and read the book why does he do that inside the minds of angry and Controlling Men by Wendy Bancroft that book will help you to see how you're being lied to and how you probably be fucking safer with a bear if you're in the kind of relationship where you are doing the emotional labour for your partner he's getting mad and it's your job to kinda walk him off that ledge and help him calm down and you kinda spend some evenings or weekends or weeks and months maybe helping walk him off this ledge and you pour all of your energy and everything you have into fixing his problems you've got your shit together you kinda always have you you you know you gotta grow strong mind on you and you're very well aware of what's happening you totally have control of the situation you totally know what's going on so you pour all of your energy into him and into fixing his problems and his life and doing everything because if you could just get those few details of his life straightened out everything would be perfect in your relationship if you could like all we have to do is iron out these few details that kinda won't go away and they've been there for years and no matter how much energy all of you pour into them they're still there but as soon as we get those few little things just out of the way our relationship will be perfect you're being manipulated it's now a toxic relationship you have somebody that's taking and taking and taking and taking but never giving and that's why you're on a bit of a hamster wheel and you think you're in love because that's how he gets you to stay he realises he be fucking homeless or lost or whatever the fuck without you so he's gonna play upon your emotions to keep you because you are a smart woman you know how to work things out you know how to fix problems and you're kind of a really determined and competitive woman so you're not gonna stop until you fix the problem but the problem is it's a hamster wheel you are his supply of energy so that he can exist that's why all of your happiness and joy has evaporated the solution is not keep trying harder because the definition of insanity is doing the same thing multiple times and expecting a different result the answer is choosing to love yourself enough to remove yourself from the situation this person doesn't love you and clearly you don't either so that's where you need to start
