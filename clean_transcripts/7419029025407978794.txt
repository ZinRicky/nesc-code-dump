JD Vance just came out and said one of the reasons people aren't having kids as much as they used to is because of car seat regulation. That is the craziest, most delusional thing I've ever heard in my life. I've never had a conversation with one of my friends who was on the fence about having kids and been like, yeah, you know, there's a lot of pros to having kids, but the car seats. Like, it's not funny, because he's completely missing any of, like, the top reasons why the birth rate is declining in order to, I don't know, have a ridiculous sound bite. This has to be on purpose at this point, I can think of, like, 10 solid reasons just off the top of my head of why the birth rate is declining. Not anywhere in the top 10 nor top 50. Is car seat regulation gonna be in there. Yeah, we're just. We're just making these kids too safe. It's a pain in the ass. Nobody wants to do that. I miss the good old days when we used to strap them in the back of the car with a cigarette in their mouth and call it a day. You know, the fucked up thing is they probably actually believe that. Uh, helmets and car seats. What a fucking riot. I miss the good old days when you used to be able to beat your wife and hang her kid out the window, like, This would be funny if this was an SNL skit, but, like, the fact that this is someone who wants to be the vice president of the United States, it's shocking and horrifying. Way to avoid the issues at all costs.
