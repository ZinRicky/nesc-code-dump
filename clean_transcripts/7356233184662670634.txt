turn this video off by saying I really do like and respect Leo but I do think that this video shows a very fundamental misunderstanding of what the actual issue I gave that man so much grace and I saw his apology and I was like wow okay hopefully now he understands like why what he said was wrong and he will unpack his fatphobic beliefs and he will change and then I saw this verbalize cause I don't know where people are pulling this out of their fucking ass that I'm fat phobic part of me so bad wants to make a joke like I ain't scared of fat people ha ha ha as a gay man deserves to like have anything taken from you or like face anything bad as you are overweight but there are things and there are consequences to that people are not watch it watch it watch it watch and this is you censoring yourself??? this whole fucking thing from last I saw I don't give up a shit about like people having to buy two plane seats right if I am someone that has to start but I fly first ha ha ha ha we get it ur rich we get it if I'm in a situation where like I exceed the size requirement and they tell me I have to buy two seats because of how big I am i'mma just buy the seat and shut the fuck up that's a consequence of my action to work out and get bigger it is my choice to make myself bigger it doesn't matter if it's through working out or “EATING MYSELF HALF TO DEATH” it doesn't matter oh that's a consequence this is reality babe it's not about fair it's about what the fuck is going on like if there's a requirement if you exceed that for either one you exceed that take the consequence or don’t fucking fly you know what I mean safe to say that respect that I had mentioned yeah that's not— done absolutely zero respect for you again he's one I followed for a while I genuinely gave him the benefit of the doubt like you can watch my last video like I was very very very willing and hoping to chalk it up to a miscommunication and some internalized fatphobia that I had hoped once was mentioned he would you know take a minute to reflect which is what he said in his apology seeing this video completely changes the context of his feelings towards fat people like this is not you saying the body wasn't bladder it's not even about clothes now if you feel lack of access to things as a consequence for being fat you are fatphobic Leo Skepi that was a fatphobic take look and I just came as a gay man wanting to make the joke about oh I'm not scared of fat people as if homophobes don't use that exact same language as a way to diminish and make fun of queer people like that is insane even with all the experience that I have with fatphobic former fat people I genuinely gave you the benefit of the doubt but it's clear your issue is not just with your former body it is with fat people in general safe to say your latest video response now actually means nothing because god that sucked so bad that sucked so bad I'm like genuinely really upset
