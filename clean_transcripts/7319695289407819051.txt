I got these skin smoothing masks from the TikTok shop. They're linked right here if you wanna get some. I do really like them. They're freeze dried, so all of the ingredients are preserved until they get to you. And the mask is in a little tray. You add a little bit of water, let it sit for about a minute, that activates all the ingredients so that you can then apply the mask. And I feel like because of that, they're really easy to kinda stick. Like you can make it as thick as you want, it's not super watery and it really holds onto your face. It's not wiggling around. And they really do smooth your skin and feel amazing.
