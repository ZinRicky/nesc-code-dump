But for real, I'm having a good moment because I had to go drop my something off for my daughter at school. And because I've been very transparent in a respectful way. You know, there you can always say you got a high conflict without dogging the other person, but, you know, you can explain, hey, you could just point out she like, hey, I currently have 100% education, making that. That. That, uh. Right. Was stripped of the other parents. So you know what I mean? You just kind of help them see the situation for what it is without. There's ways to do that. But now when I go to the school, they're so nice to me. I go and I've talked to the receptionist and I've explained the situation like this. I don't get to see her talk to my kids. She's like, how? I had a father like that too. I know what's going on. And so now if I just have to drop off the simplest thing, I say, can you call her to the front so I can say hi really quick? No problems. Doesn't even look, got it. And I get to see my kids and say hi and fucking skirt that, you know what I mean? Fuck them. They don't win. They don't win.
