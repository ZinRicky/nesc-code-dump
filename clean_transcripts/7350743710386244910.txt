but I am like I am scared shitless like it is really scary and I know exactly how you're feeling I'm a single mom to four kids and it's been five years since I left and I remember having those panic attacks and not being able to sleep and um all the weird little things I did to kinda make myself feel better and it really truly is a journey like it is your journey it's your path because it's your life it's your child it's like your everything so as scary as it is this is your time to talk to yourself and start to retrain yourself that that scare and that fear is also excitement do you know what I mean we kinda have to retrain our bodies and our brains to remember that anxiety is a big term and it includes a lot of feelings and some things are scary and it's still okay to do them like just like we teach our kids like they are nervous to start walking they just you know piddle around until and they keep falling and we're the ones that keep encouraging them to get up like you just have to remember that for yourself like there are gonna be times where you like trip or stumble or you know things don't seem super duper clear like trust me when I tell you there are days where I'm like what am I doing how am I gonna make it but I always do I always do and you always will like you will always make it if you have the fucking inside of you to be like fuck this I deserve better I'm leaving not only do you just have it in you to make it you're not the kind of person that's just gonna sit by and let yourself fall do you know what I mean it takes it takes a really brave strong person to make that decision and to leave and to say I'm gonna fuck this is my life and I'm gonna fucking do it and you're gonna do it it is scary and that's okay and you just keep pushing through and I promise you the thing that keeps me going is seeing the women that have been gone for 20 25 30 years and they're like girl it only gets better the longer you're gone it only gets easier your kid gets older and can do more for themself you know your finances get more stable you just figure everything out it's scary because you're looking at the whole of it right now you just gotta look at right now or tomorrow or this day you know what I mean just break it into to digestible chunks and I promise you you're gonna make it and I am so excited to see you on this journey I'm so excited for you and I am here for you I know I can't do much like physically we're far away we're just internet friends but I'm here to fucking cheer you on all of you I love you don't stay in a toxic marriage
