this is a great question let's talk about it an abortion is a termination of a pregnancy and this may need to be done for a wide range of reasons an abortion may be necessary to complete an otherwise incomplete miscarriage or an individual may have pre existing conditions or just generally have conditions that are being exacerbated by their pregnancy and they need to terminate their pregnancy a person may need to terminate their pregnancy so that they can receive things like cancer treatment the pregnant individual may be a child whose body is literally too small but they face significant added health risks if they are forced to continue the pregnancy those are just a few examples but it's really important to note that all abortions are medically necessary because we know that it is incredibly dangerous to force people to continue their pregnancies against their will it is not just some minor inconvenience to a person pregnancy is incredibly dangerous and could cost them their life their health their reproductive organs and in no other area of this country do we force people to sacrifice themselves or their organs for any other person's life so we don't force people or even dead people to give their organs despite all the people dying waiting on the organ donor list and we don't force people to give blood so yeah there you have it um I hope this was helpful and let me know if you have any other questions
