most fat people I know have or have had eating disorders in their lifetime but y'all do not treat fat people with eating disorders with the same empathy that you treat thin people with eating disorders world treats thin people thin women specifically with eating disorders as these like delicate little children who would break if they're touched wrong when you see a thin person with an eating disorder to the point where they're looking emaciated that they're looking sick like you can see that sickness on them you have so much empathy because you can see that that disorder is harming the life it's killing them but then when fat people have eating disorders you don't see that you see that as a moral personal feeling and you think that a fat person with an eating disorder like that's their own fault it's their own choice but it's the it's the same thing eating disorders are mental illness whether it causes you to binge or restrict or whatever it does and having a disordered relationship with food is genuinely something that so many people have experienced but because y'all have such a narrow view of first of all who deserves empathy and kindness and also of what these illnesses look like y'all don't know how to treat people who have them that ever exist outside of your purview of what that should look like and like this is also not just from like people who don't have any disorders at all it's like from people with eating disorders there's also this hierarchy of like of like how people should be treated based on how thin they are they just it boils down to fatphobia like there's so much fatphobia in the world y'all don't even see what you're doing that's fatphobic ultimately just like shows how much hatred there is fat people but it's just weird it's weird and odd
