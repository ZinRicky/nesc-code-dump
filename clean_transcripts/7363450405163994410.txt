I will never understand people who say they hate children I just want to ask the millennials and the Gen Zers and people my age who are complaining and saying they hate children and they hate big families who exactly do you think is going to be taking care of you when you get old? we are currently in a population crisis here in the US right now our birth rate is far below replacement rate and if you have ever taken even a basic economics class you know that that is a major problem fewer births don't just lead to a smaller population they lead to an older one we're gonna have more Americans on Social Security and fewer workers to cover the cost of that we're also gonna have fewer accountants fewer teachers fewer scientists fewer farmers our generation is going to get old we are going to get sick we are going to need people to change our diapers and to take care of us those people are going to be the children that you are complaining about right now no matter who you are no matter how much money you make no matter how independent you think you are someday you are going to get old and you are going to be dependent on either your own children or somebody else's children to take care of you in several different ways you are going to be reliant on the very children that you are complaining about see people don't just have children cause they're fun fashion accessories that we can carry around one of the major reasons that human beings have children and have done so since the dawn of man is to keep our species alive to keep our population alive our children loud and noisy of course are they hard to take care of yes do they cost money and time and effort yes of course but guess what they are a major investment into not only my future but yours as well
