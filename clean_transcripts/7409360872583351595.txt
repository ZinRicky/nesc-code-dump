I need to preserve all this cream that I've been getting from my Camp. Cora. This is, like, so much cream. This is Jersey beautiful cream. Now, some of this might be sour. I've been collecting this for, like, two weeks. I've been using it for cooking, for my coffee. So I'm gonna give everything a sniff test. Look how thick that cream is on top. Turn on the camera. Мам а I'm so tired. I'm about to get hurt or I'm about to fall or something. My body. My body.
