one of my resolutions this year is to make it easier like everything easier and travel is something that I find very stressful it's all about packing unpacking do I have the thing and then you're missing the one little thing you need and that's why I love unscented and all of their little cute travel packs that they have not only is it a woman owned to company um that's completely sustainable but their products are amazing they don't have any of those toxic dyes or fragrances which make us sick and my personal favorite is their little travel case it's so cute look how happy he is he's making it easy or ready to see who knows you just drop your shampoo bar in there and conditioner Happy New Year
