why do we let ourselves go when we're in a happy relationship men and women both do this okay in the beginning when you're trying to find a partner you're always trying to look your best look sharp put on that good impression but after you found your partner and you're happy kind of slowly lose interest in looking your best at all times now why is that? Once we settle down there's not as much urgency because you found someone It’s the physical form of revealing your bad personality traits once you settle down, granted as we get older, our body changes, therefore our lifestyle changes, and often times we have children, and we prioritize them. We’re either devoting more energy to children or work instead of ourselves we're on the go more often so instead of spending the time to cook something healthy we're often grabbing something that's unhealthy so we're dealing with the inevitable aging process and lifestyle changes but we're you shouldn't let yourself go in the process you should prioritize yourself and by doing so you can prioritize your family take care of your mental health and physical appearance because it does matter once we're comfortable we naturally want to let ourselves go or be more relaxed which is okay but you shouldn't completely let yourself go making sure you don't let yourself go and stay in shape is so important for mental health and not only that it ensures that you can live a long life with your family Is that not the most important thing? so not only is it important for you but it's also important for your partner the person they fell in love with that's who they want Ok maybe not exactly what they want, but you should always put in effort to make sure that you're taking care of yourself and your appearance Yes life gets busy but don't don't let yourself go in the process
