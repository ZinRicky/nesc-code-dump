there's an upcoming election in the US it's been a big election year for like the whole world but this one's gonna be big and there's one huge thing that I have noticed that is like missing in the discourse so I saw Congresswoman Cori Bush talk about this so I wanna talk about the difference between your moral conscience and strategy when it comes to voting in an election I feel that on this app a lot of the time people struggle to hold contradictions and obviously there is a demonstrated lack of nuance here when it comes to these conversations the Corey Bush is asked could you in good conscience vote for Kamala I can't say it cause I'm shame we say Kamala Kamala Harris in the upcoming election she says I don't know because what you're saying is in moral like with a moral compass could you in good faith vote for this person she's saying I don't know but there's a difference between a strategic vote and a moral vote so oh yes it might be strategically the best thing to keep in fact I'm quite sure it is to keep Donald Trump out of office you need to vote for the only other viable option does that mean that your vote is completely morally aligned with your values unlikely I mean there is a ðŸ§¬ oh side going on and the administration currently is doing very little stop it and infactor aiding aiding it in a in a big in a big way it is very hard to watch and then to navigate how we kind of vote I'm Australian I talk about US politics sometimes cause a huge amount of my followers on here are from the US and I do believe that US politics just it ricochets around the world there it affects us all we hear about it all as well all the time it's hard not to develop an opinion on it when it affects you and it affects Australia and affects our sensibilities but I think people are finding this really hard and I just urge you I just wanted to introduce this concept in case you haven't thought of it this way because I think it can be helpful to think of it in this way is you might have to make a decision that strategic in this case um and acknowledge that you made the best decision you could um in a less than ideal circumstance and it's a tricky one because we know that like domestically a lot of the policies and a lot of the values of the Democrats do align with our views all the views that I tend to talk about a lot here on my platform um but internationally they seem to be in complete contradiction to that and um yeah I guess everyone has a different range of the way that they put on domestic issues versus international I personally believe that we all have some sort of responsibility to look at what's going on overseas um especially given that we live in a globalized world and various economy support one another to conduct w a r s and ðŸ§¬ oh side in that matter um but some people will go you know what's not our business and I'm just gonna look at you know where we're at as a country and what this party is gonna do for the country and yeah people put different amounts of weight on that I think either way it's a very un ideal situation um but I fully support you to vote strategically because I don't know that it's possible to have a conscience vote um ever um let alone in this particular election in 2024
