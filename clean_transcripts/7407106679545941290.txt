I actually got this at an antique store, so this is a vintage one. They are hard to find. I have not found a bread cutter that can cut sourdough like this. Cuts it all uniformly and it's super easy to cut. I absolutely don't like cutting sourdough bread with a bread knife, and I do not like the bow knives as it does not cut the actual bottom of the bread. Bow knives look pretty, but they are not very useful. This cuts the bread so smoothly. Even the end piece right here, it just cuts it perfectly. I added the link here for you for a new one as the vintage ones are hard to find.
