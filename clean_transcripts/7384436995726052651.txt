There's, like. There's, like, a two out of 10 chance that I'm pregnant. I am really nervous, but I'm like, I know I'm not pregnant. This is just for kissing giggles. What? Oh, my goodness. What? There's no way. Shh! There's two lines. There are two lines. I've never had two lines before in my life. What on earth? I don't believe this. I am totally gonna get my period this weekend. This is not right. I am going to take another one.
