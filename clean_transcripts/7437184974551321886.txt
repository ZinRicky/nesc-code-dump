I, I don't wanna talk about the shitty heavy stuff. I wanna tell you something super cool. My daughter is a freshman in high school and she fucking came home and told me. Mom, did you know that my school does dual enrollment and I can take college classes at the same time? I'm going to high school and I can graduate high school with, if not with my whole ass associate degree. Damn near close to it. And the college I wanna go to only has an 11% acceptance rate. So I wanna make sure I can do everything I can do to get in. And I could die happy. Jesus fuck! Oh my god. That's like the happiest thing I ever could have heard from my daughter. She's not planning her fucking wedding. She's not picking out baby names at 14. She's looking up the acceptance rate for the college she wants to get into and right now making moves to make sure she can get there. And I think part of why she does that is cause she knows she's loved and supported. And I don't know, that felt like a huge fucking win. And I think it's important to celebrate those wins. And I like, I. I don't think I've ever felt that amount of love and pride in my heart ever. For anything ever. Like, I didn't know. I didn't. I, man, I just. I mean, of course you dream that your kids are gonna Have dreams and that they're gonna, like, take steps to make those dreams happen and stuff. But, like, just. I don't know. I don't know. That was like the coolest fucking thing ever. And I just wanted to share it with the world cause I'm so proud of her. I'm so proud of her and it. But, yeah.
