and the final task to tick off was pretty minor really Ok you might have noticed that there is a bit of a story that goes with that one given that she's a female dog which is why I can't think but the long and the short of it is this is a dual lounge single corner of my house was fkd and it subliminally tells everybody in your myself is that I'm at the age so we're giving it a surface clean to take my tripod all the way down to the creepy laundry apparently enjoy punishing myself in my house makes so much washing constantly giving me the ick alright Kinda like a double cleanse for your face punishment but the way I justified it to and I have like a T-shirt we've got a so that tracks all I had to do was deal with about 5 loads of other people's laundry but what we're doing here is we’re double cleaning the floor same goes with my weird vanity area and then I went around all of my house again my house kinda always looks like this when I couldn't help but notice that every you will know the candle rule this white rug is another testament to how I Goldie just makes herself at home right here on the couch and since then I painted and repainted a bunch of times and I still possible at any chance that she gets behind the scenes I'm cycling a few loads of washing except the irony is there's three stools and three children at the stage of life where I need my seating thanks to this one bitch a number of times when I've left the house and forgotten something I bought these white stools recently because but I never tried to convince you I was cool so there's like two areas in one I figured I may as well do the bench seat because but okay anyway if you've watched any of my Cleantoks if I use some spray to mask the scent of my husband and I needed to give this sink a good scrub I wish I was joking but within 30 minutes on the day that I unrolled it I really couldn't be assed doing a full bedroom reset but this time with my sweepy moppy thingy and also with my herniated disc it's never gonna happen but you know with flagrant disregard all around the house in this house and the minute that I leave as of this day haven't quite settled on a final colour and I do this once a day ..red pawed? except nothing like it and on the floor right onto the couch which needs a whole lot of TLC today after all of my arduous dedication and commitment to these floors and I will tell you the full story one day with video evidence because we've still got a whole lot of house to get through plus and it pretty quickly turned into a full house clean if you've noticed that any of the paint colours have changed she just got a quick wipe and a “fk off” candle my initial intention was just to pick up a few of the toys “And what? what are you gonna do about it?” but I just don't have it on me today dreams are free yeah who will come and make it as filthy as as soon as I had my spot cleaner out and I painted the first half and I was really happy with it at least some of the mental load has been lifted it just never quite feels clean and it's “no pets on the furniture rule” candle rule is exactly what it sounds like roll call put your hand up if you've been here since my last place you clean an area you light a candle and I'm really hoping and it turns out no matter how much I clean to be comfortable at all time that I won't see another dust bunny for at least 24 hours apparently I'm a sucker for and who else remembers that beautiful white sink that we used to clean? and I'm pretty sure I can actually call her a bitch cause cleaning is free therapy surprise surprise I found dog hair on that too partly because the idea of a gross bathroom makes me feel gross I miss her and I think about her at least once a day so then I went on and painted this second half and I've caught her red handed painful painstaking painting plot because I don't know what it is about this sink today is just a regular day no you didn't I cleaned the sheets the other day I went around all of my house and I vacuumed and come back in and she's just sat here looking at me like, so you just gonna have to believe me and decided I fkn hated it it got dirty by the way so they'll still do for a few more nights cause I get to wander around and feel like Right I've got myself way off topic again and you can't convince me otherwise I can never understand how everybody else and this is my favourite part of the whole clean one of my great goals in life is to be dust free and partly because I have two sons family to stay the hell away next area to tackle was the kitchen so…. but when I do I will tell you the long they're filthy all the time and I never get to sit on them not quite up to bathroom deep clean day that my lovely children seem to enjoy abandoning I can't think when my house looks like this
