I keep it right here next to my stove and it's perfect for cooking keeping eggs at room temperature is really important when baking but my favourite thing about it is that it organises my eggs and which was the oldest first which came in from the coop first is always readily available at the bottom cause my chickens are free range I always crack my egg into this little Mason cash bowl first just to double check that the eggs haven't been incubated you see this egg is fertilized right here but it hasn't incubated I love seeing my eggs on display
