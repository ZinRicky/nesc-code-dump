I never knew I could love a trash can the way I love this one it is made from stainless steel it has two compartments I use one for trash the other for recycling they're 8 gallons each it has two soft closing lids and it just looks so nice in my kitchen they have a few colors and I chose white never will I go back to the outdated plastic bins that I used to use for kitchen trash this thing is here to stay and I love it
