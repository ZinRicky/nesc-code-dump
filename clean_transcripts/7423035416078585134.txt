We will have officially owned this house for two weeks on Wednesday, and we are now prepping for Hurricane No. 2 in this house. That feels like some kind of bad omen or something, but here we are. This is our reality. The last one we just got the outer bands of, and it kind of skirted along the West Coast. This one's coming right for us. So it's a little bit more prep involved, A little more anxiety and fear. It's giving Ian vibes, and I don't really love that. So let's get prepped for another Hurricane.
