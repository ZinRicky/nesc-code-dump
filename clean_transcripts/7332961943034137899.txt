Stan this is a great question and I'm so glad you asked it where do we hang out if we're single where do women Latina women hang out okay we're probably at the grocery store a bookstore maybe a Pilates class a yoga class and we're not out late usually we're in bed so we can wake up early and go to our Pilates class it's not that hard to find us we might even be at target buying things to make our home homey yeah we're everywhere
