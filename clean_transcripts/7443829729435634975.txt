spend the morning with me as a home school mom we really value slow mornings and we all kinda do our own thing I used to get up an hour before my kids but after the time change that just hasn't happened so while I read my bible and have some me time in the morning the kids are playing outside I do better throughout the day if I have some me time and they do so much better if they have fresh air and sunshine so these mornings are a win win for all of us since it's a Monday and the weather is so nice I'm gonna let the kids play outside and not start school work until after speech therapy that will also give me a chance to enjoy my coffee and stay in my pajamas and read a good book it is one of those mornings where it is just too cold to get changed right now so I'm gonna snuggle up until speech therapy and I'll get Maverick set for speech and get myself ready for the day that is my idea of a perfect morning
