I understand that the early 2000â€™s did irreparable damage to the way that we view what is and is not fat and has honestly caused so many eating disorders and issues with body image issues with eating issues with with the way people look I understand but I need you all to understand that fatness is not subjective like when I'm talking about fat I'm talking about plus size people like people that are 14/16+ if you call yourself fat it's like I understand what you're what you're saying about fatness being subjective like sure yeah but like if you're saying that like you're not actually fat but you have body dysmorphia so you view yourself as fat it doesn't mean you're not actually fat like do you understand that I have I don't have an issue with people who have body dysmorphia I honestly emphasize and I I cannot understand how difficult it could be to not understand what your body looks like but you also have to understand that your biggest fear with body dysmorphia is having a body that looks like me like my actual body is what you are horrified of imagining that your body looks like does that make sense so like you know I just urge people to be a little bit more mindful about the way that they talk about bodies by the way they talk about fatness and understand it's one thing to have your own personal insecurity but when you put that onto the internet it is no longer an individual problem and if you're going on to the internet and you're disparaging entire group of people that are larger than you because you think that you look bad because you look like them like it's very reasonable that someone from that group would have a response
