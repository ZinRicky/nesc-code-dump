plan a week of homeschooling with me plus take a look inside our curriculum for reading we use all about rating and my first graders on level 1 this week we're gonna learn the flosseral and when to double a cosmic at the end of award I absolutely love this curriculum because it follows the science of reading scope and sequence and it's a multi sensory program my second grader is in level 2 and this week we're learning the silent E rule it's important to note that the level does not correspond with grade level cause it's a mastery based program you start with pre reading or level 1 and move at your child's pace for US geography we're using R50 states by knotgrass I really like this curriculum because it incorporates state history and geography it also has additional reading and extra activities that you can incorporate you can really do as much or as little as you want this week we're gonna make a recipe with sweet potatoes and do a Pepsi taste test for science we're doing the Sassafra Science Adventures anatomy study it's kind of unique because it's a novel based study so you listen to the novel and you learn alongside the Sassafras twins as they go on a science adventure and we log what we're learning in our anatomy journey I also like to add some of the hands on activities from the little school Smith's anatomy studies I just think her ideas are so fun and engaging for kids this is another one of those curriculum choices that you can do as much or as little as you want depending on your child's age my kids absolutely love this study are always asking to do it for math we're doing math with confidence and both of my kids are at the second grade level I love this because so much of the learning is hands on and off the page this definitely not an open and go math program and it requires a lot of planning but both of my kids being on the same level has made it so fun because we do a lot of math games and lastly we are doing the Foundation Series by not consumeristry right now we're studying the Old Testament doing a brief outline of every book of the Bible I love this because it's teaching my kids how to get in the work if you're a homeschool mom what lessons and activities are you planning this week
