I am so paranoid about my mouth and what it smells like what my breath is like from this really mean person I had a really crappy partner that used to manipulate me in arguments by saying my breath stink so soon as I would bring up an argument he would be like oh god your breath kinda smells can we talk about this later and I'd be like oh my god like immediately oh my god but like all the time and I went it gave me such dental paranoia I went to the dentist I got all kinds of work done on my mouth and I asked the dentist like okay the I I'm good right like there should I mean I got a deep deep I've done everything to my mouth and he would still be like girl can we talk your breath I can't what did you eat and I would just be so paranoid and that just stuck with me like looking back now that's bullshit that that was just his he knew that was the quickest way to get me to shut up and that's what he used but it did give me and and keep this like paranoia about my mouth and the smell that comes from it so I love this toothbrush from the TikTok shop it got all these different settings I just used a cleaning setting but it does have even for sensitive okay the head of the brush is so small you can only put a pea sized amount which is the appropriate amount it's also small so it really fits in your mouth really nice and easily it's like super comfy I just I'm not even trying to be stupid but that this toothbrush makes me feel very confident about my breath like I know it's getting all up in there it's linked right here if you wanna get one cause I love this thing
