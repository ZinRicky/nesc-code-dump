if you're getting mad at the drizzle drizzle movement or soft guy era then you might wanna take a look in the mirror because what you're demanding or requiring out of men to earn you or earn your love is literally part of the joke because they're flipping a script on you ask yourself why is this really making me mad it's probably coming from within what you demand or require from a man to be in your life you can't provide what they're demanding What you demand from a man you can't provide which is why you're getting angry Men are literally just giving us our same energy back so if you don't like this movement or you think it's annoying What does that make us what does that make you I guess we should all respect men's standards like we respect our own Not only that it's really not that serious they think it's a joke The whole movement is generally satire but it's honestly funny you love to see it you love to see people get worked up saying oh, I don't want a dusty crusty man so it'll save me time on finding a man they're now being in their soft guy era it's literally satire they're flipping the script getting a taste of your own medicine I just think it's really funny What do you guys think? I think this movement is just gonna persist until more people or women wrap their brains around the illogical demands that they expect from men
