So as women, we know we live in a different reality than men do, right? But this manifested the other day in such an interesting way. So I was driving with my husband, and we are parking at this big box store with a big parking lot, and he likes to park super far away, as far away from anyone else as possible, as far away from the front door as possible. And I was huffing and puffing. I'm like, ugh, you always do this? You always park so far away. And he's like, yeah. He's like, I don't want the car to get messed up. He goes, but you always park so close to other people. Why do you do that? And I was like, oh my god. He doesn't know. He was like, is it because you have short little legs and you don't wanna walk? And I'm like, no, it's so I don't get kidnapped. And he thought I was crazy. He thinks it's just me. And I was like, no. A lot of women do this. Will park either close to the front, close to the cart return, or under a light. I'm like, for visibility. Cause although your priority is the car not getting dinged, mine is not getting kidnapped. And I feel like those are different levels of concern.
