When I had my first kid, all of the relationships in my life had to change. And I think this is a really common struggle for new parents is that all of a sudden, they're looking at the relationships with their siblings, with their family, with their in laws, um, all completely differently, because now you're looking through an entirely new lens. I know for me, as a people pleaser, my whole life, I accepted the status quo with all of my relationships and just wanted to keep the peace. But once it wasn't really about me anymore, once it was the priority of my children, everything changed. Because not only does having a child make you re evaluate how you were raised, you realize that keeping the peace isn't worth it if it's gonna be stepping all over all of your, like, parental instincts. And I feel like I've also even seen this transition happen when people get married. People who decide to be child free or can't have children because of circumstances. When they're prioritizing their safety and happiness and well being of their partner versus a family member or extended family member or parent, all of the dynamics need to shift or can shift. Because you're more likely to accept the status quo that you grew up with if it's just about you, but once it's about somebody you love, now you're ready to set some boundaries.
