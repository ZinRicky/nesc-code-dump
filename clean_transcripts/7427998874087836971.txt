let's plan for a week of homeschooling this is our first full week of school in a week between moving and back to back hurricanes we have gotten really out of our rhythm so I am really looking forward to this week getting ready to get back into routine and do school in our new homeschool room I've been homeschooling for three years now and I've never had all my stuff in one place I've been reunited with a lot of my stuff and I'm excited to die but I'll be honest I kinda forget what I'm doing so this week is gonna be a lot of review and just trying to get our bear we're gonna get back into our curriculum and do a lot of games and activities
