okay TikTok this is for all you healthy people out there I make this all the time honestly so I figured I'd share this recipe Cottage cheese guacamole salsa and lime okay (fresh is better) if you're fit, you wanna be healthy you're trying to be healthy this is a hack do this high protein it's filling this is about how much I eat per serving idk the calories but I'm guessing it's a lot better than just having straight up salsa which is 60 calories per tablespoon so what I do is I add enough cottage cheese to my liking if you don't like cottage cheese blend it I don't know you can probably do it with Greek yogurt in fact plain Greek yogurt would be great grab your favorite chip and 🤌🏼 it's delicious
