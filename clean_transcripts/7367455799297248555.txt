controversial I don't think that every statement has to be perfect all the time like I think a lot of these creators are like I'm just not informed I don't I just don't know what's going on I'm just so silly and stupid I just I'm not smart enough to talk about I would rather you say something six months ago and continue to talk about it and educate yourself and while educating yourself changing your mind and opinion and showing your audience that at least you intend to be on the side of the people that are experiencing this genocide I would rather you have tried messed up and continue trying then it just stayed silent the whole time people are like oh I'm just I'm scared of saying the wrong thing whatever I say the wrong thing all the time plenty of people say the wrong thing all the time do you know what you do when you say the wrong thing you apologize you learn you move on you grow and then you say something better the next time maybe not everyone will agree with me but that's what I prefer I would prefer at least that someone show the intent the intent of trying and the intent of showing that you're educating yourself and trying to do better than to just stay silent as if you are this useless mouthpiece with nothing to say it just like okay let's say you didn't wanna say anything in october by November there was three weeks worth of video of the ground in Palestine showing exactly what is happening to Palestinians and again even if you don't understand the entire political situation just saying this is wrong and no human being should go through this like start there start there like say something like I would much rather you say hi I'm not educated I'm learning these are some people to learn from or you know this is what I'm learning this is who I'm learning from like say that you don't we're not expecting you to be an expert in international politics I'm not expecting that from a random influencer what I am expecting is at the very least showing some kind of stance amplifying something from someone smarter than you if you do not have the capacity to speak we're not expecting perfect we're expecting effort
