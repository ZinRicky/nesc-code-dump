Remember when I said don't judge me if I'm wearing the same pants every day? I'm wearing them again. Yes. I wore the green pair. Today I'm wearing the black pair. These are amazing. I love the way they feel my body. I am doing housework today, and I'm comfy, cozy. And, I mean, I look pretty cute and put together for my husband gets home, so it's a win win.
