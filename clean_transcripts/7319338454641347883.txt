this video isn't about this individual but I do think it's time we have a conversation about no ethical consumption under capitalism because I think that we've bastardized that saying this is what we're talking about when we say no ethical consumption under capitalism because we in the United States have several monopolies that influence most of our lives for example recently with Palestine people are saying you should protest Coca Cola however the BDS movement specifically didn't put Coca Cola as a target because it is so difficult to target Coca Cola as a company because of how many subsidiaries it had these 10 companies while evil own so much of like the food and makeup and everything that like goes about our lives we wouldâ€” it would be nearly impossible to protest in a situation like this do I wanna give these evil parent companies my money no but for some people it is quite literally the only option they have and that is where the saying no ethical conduction under capitalism has come but when it comes to TikTok shop no ethical contemption under capitalism does not cover you being able to get a three dollar ring light it doesn't cover the knock off sold de Janeiro perfume that you get I'm not like judging you guys if you are shopping at TikTok shop I understand but you don't get to use no ethical consumption under capitalism to justify it that's just not what it's for
