um so the US government spent $820 billion on the military last year and guess how much they spent on um maternal health less than half a percent of that so when we say there's no money for mothers also two moms in Gaza die every hour that money is going to that and despite being more affected by war mothers are more likely to be involved in peacekeeping mothers of IDF soldiers in Israel have been mobilizing they took inspiration from another mother's movement in the 90s that ended the um occupation of Lebanon so listen to moms pay moms value moms moms don't want scented candles they want a ceasefire
