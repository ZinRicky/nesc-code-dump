the biggest problem with relationships these days is everybody thinks “you're supposed to meet my needs” here's why that's never going to work People usually have a relationship that goes one of three ways the “if you don't meet my needs, I'm going to leave” which is pretty immature Or the Equality route which is great, the “you do your part, I'll do mine” but there's no real passion there okay and then there's the third relationship that will always work which is the “I'll do whatever it takes to meet your needs” these relationships always work Their equally passionate about meeting each other's needs because it fuels them every day when they wake up when they first open their eyes they want to meet your needs because it drives them that is the key essential component to a long lasting relationship
