I heard a lot growing up of, like, how people know you're a Christian if you. If you wear women's pants or if you cut your hair, if you wear makeup. It's like, the Holy Spirit. Are you really that close minded? And you put everything in a box and you put god in a box that he won't dwell in you and he won't work through you and he won't speak through you. Because he is so good. Is he not magnificent? Is he not holy? Is he not all knowing? Like, that's so wild to me that I thought that I had to look so different to be set apart. It's like, no, the Holy Spirit has already set me apart. I am set apart because I am a child of god. Period.
