Tell me how. I am a mom of three kids. I homeschool two of them. I have a cold today. I'm, like, sniffly and stuffy, and I feel like shit, and I'm sitting in bed doing laundry, and somehow this is, like a luxurious break. Like, the craziest things become luxuries when you have kids around all the time. Just being able to sit here and do one task without being asked to do, like, six other ones. Like, I've got a little Theraflu. I might put on some Netflix and fold, like, 3 loads of laundry today. And for a stay at home mom slash homeschool mom, that's like. It's like a vacation.
