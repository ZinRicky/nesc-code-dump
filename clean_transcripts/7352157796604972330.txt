you guys ever not like leaving your house because you don't like crowds so usually go out when it's not busy? well I do too and today forgot that it was Good Friday so a lot of people had the day off and I had errands to run I went to a couple places and there were just so many times when women would just strike up a conversation with me I love having good conversations with people especially if you're nice so the first lady when I was getting my pedicure she liked the polish I chose so she was complimenting me on it and then we just started talking she started telling me about her family it was just something so nice and so different than what I'm used to I'm not used to striking up a conversation with someone especially if I'm running errands I'm usually trying to be quick in and out but it was just so nice to have a meaningful conversation or getting to know someone when you usually wouldn't and when I went over to the manicure station I was talking to my nail artist and she asked me if I was going to church and the lady right next to me asked like oh what church do you go to? I told her I didn't really have one yet I was still trying to figure that out but she suggested her church so she started conversation with me and I thought it was so sweet so thoughtful and not only that I just got a new house and she's a realtor she offered to help me with my homestead so just like simple interactions like that, that I wouldn't usually have because I don't like crowds it was just so nice and refresh I'm not sure what it is Am I just like super friendly looking? Is that why women to strike up conversations with me? Then I went to go look at rugs this other lady was like wow that is a great carpet good choice started to ask me questions it was a nice sweet lady but it made me realize I avoid crowds so much That I miss out on these simple human interactions that make me so happy No, nobody loves crowds but if I went out and it wasn't busy I probably wouldn't have had those interactions with these wonderful women Which got me thinking, if you're a person and you don't like crowds and you stay in when it's busy You should try to go out when it's busy and see if you can strike up a conversation with someone or if someone else tries to strike up a conversation with you Try to be engaging maybe it's because I'm exuding a nice vibe or personality but I don't know You should try it out!
