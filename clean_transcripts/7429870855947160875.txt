Alright, I wasn't gonna post my outfit because I'm having one of those days, known as day 1 of the cycle, where I just don't feel good about my body or myself or my life or any of my choices. It's. It's a rough day. But after putting the whole outfit together, I feel potentially better. A good outfit can change the attitude. It really can.
