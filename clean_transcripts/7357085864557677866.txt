hello good morning I just woke up in a hotel room by myself and it is one of the greatest feelings in the world why you may ask because I'm a mom of three young kids and technically I'm here on a conference and on and not on vacation but um when you're a mom with three young kids any hotel room where you have get to wake up and have coffee before someone screams at you for breakfast is a vacation now the thing that I actually find annoying and and slightly interesting is that I still woke up really tired and extra puffy and I don't know it's maybe because it was a travel day yesterday maybe it was cause I was up from four in the morning travelling to get here yesterday and I stayed up late and there's a time difference and I took some Z equal to sleep and that shit will knock you right out but somehow in one hotel night sleep uninterrupted I have gone from what was a spry 36 year old to what looks like until it goes a 70 year old man so I'm gonna need a little extra makeup magic this morning because we're gonna wake up we're gonna get up we're gonna kick today's ass or at least we're gonna look good while we try to do that
