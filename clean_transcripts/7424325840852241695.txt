If you hate bugs like I hate bugs, you need this. It is an electric fly swatter, and they sell them on the TikTok shop. It's linked right here. I'm going camping this weekend and it says not. I would. I'm not gonna touch it, cause it says not to touch it, but it has, so I'm stupid excited to make sure that I can fucking chill out in peace. It charges. It just comes with this little dock, see? And you charge it. And then it's also kind of funny because you got this, like, little stand. It's. I'm. I cannot wait to zap some motherfuckers.
