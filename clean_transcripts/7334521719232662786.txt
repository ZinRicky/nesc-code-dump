not to be dramatic but I think I might have just had the best weekend of my entire life and I didn't achieve anything no cleaning no renovation no jobs no work I was just present in the moment and god it was good I kicked off the weekend by having a one on one mini golf date with my middle child my boy Malachi and normally I never show my kids on TikTok okay but I really wanna be able to relive this weekend over and over also I think it's important for you to know that sometimes I do other things and I don't just spend all of my time cleaning one thing that you might not know about me is once upon a time I used to be young and quite fun one of my first jobs like 16 years ago was at a dance music radio station and that really just fostered this love of gigs and going out and listening to live music and talking shit obviously and you probably already know but I became a mother at 20 so for a big chunk of the last 12 years I haven't really gone out a whole lot and one thing that my husband and I decided when we moved back to Auckland last year was that we wanted to spend our money on making memories and sharing experiences together so when my sister in law and her partner invited us to come to Synthony to celebrate her birthday we thought hell yeah that sounds great our friend Clint Roberts was an amazing MC and we saw Tiki Taane Fat Freddy's Drop, Synthony and Rudimental I won't lie I was a little bit overwhelmed by the sheer number of people that were there and they said that they were expecting 35,000 I didn't believe them but yep there was 35,000 there and we called it a night quite early cause I didn't wanna feel tired the next day this spider lives my car by the way and I can't catch him but I've named him Michael and he quite likes drinking out of my Stanley anyway I had a special mummy daughter date day lined up with my youngest Olive and I took her to Kiwi Valley Farm which is in Waitakere and I haven't been here for about five years so I don't know what I was expecting but it definitely exceeded my expectation and honestly this girl was having the time of her life like she would come here every single day if I let her we held the baby animals and then we went around the farm and she fed each and every single one she was not gonna let one animal get away with not being fed we went on a tractor ride which was super fun they took us up to the top of the farm and you got quite a good view looking down and there are few extra animals and horses and things for her to look at and then we went and lined up for a pony ride and of course we had to do it twice she had to do everything on the farm twice I'm not even joking we were here all day that was kind of the point and I had nowhere else to be and I was just happy she was happy by the way if you're keeping tabs on the fairness scale like I am and you noticed that I only took two out of three children on a date this week don't worry cause I took my eldest on a one on one date last week anyway we wanted to round out the weekend with some special time as a family and the kids suggested going off to the movies and I don't know about you but I'm not a huge fan of actually going to the movies and also I was thoroughly peopled-out I looked at what was showing and the only movie that we actually wanted to go see was the new Willy Wonka by the way this mess is why I normally don't do my skincare in my pjs Anyway so I did a little googling and it turns out you can actually rent the Wonka movie from the neon app here in Aotearoa New Zealand and we collectively decided aka I made the executive decision that getting in my jammies doing my skincare having some takeaways and watching the movie from the comfort of my own home sounded way better than going out that is exactly what we ended up doing even broke the rules and let the kids eat in front of the telly which we never do but don't worry I did put a towel down and I'm bloody pleased I did because that pasta sauce was messy And because I wanted the kids to feel like they were getting a proper movie experience and it was still a bit special we ordered in some treats which we never do and can I just say that the Wonka movie was fantastic
