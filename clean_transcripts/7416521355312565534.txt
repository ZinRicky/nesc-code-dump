Here's some foods I made today to make sure we have food for the week. I cut my sourdough into eight equal pieces, then shaped them into small English muffin rounds and allowed them to rise for two hours before cooking them in a pan. I had been sprouting walnuts for the past 24 hours, so I rinse these and put them in the dehydrator to crisp up. I washed some NYX minimalized corn that had been soaking all night and made a big batch of fresh masa using a Molino to grind the corn into a dough. I made some pumpkin muffins which the kids loved, but I wasn't happy with the texture, so I'll be making these again soon. I made some sourdough cinnamon rolls which had fermented overnight. The dough was so nice and soft and I spread cinnamon butter all over it before letting it rise again. Then I spread a homemade cream cheese frosting over top. I batched out two zucchini lasagnas. These are low in carbs and high in protein. Made a big batch of hamburger for quick snacks, a garden fresh salad for quick lunches, and a Mayo dressing. Pasture raised egg bites for protein on the go. Ice start some leftover lard from cooking pasture raised bacon by straining the particles out. And then I made some sauerkraut.
