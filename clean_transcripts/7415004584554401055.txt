get ready with me as a 31 year old homeschool mom who doesn't wear makeup and puts a minimal effort into her appearance I really wish I was a makeup girly but I rarely ever wear more than mascara and I don't feel like myself in a full face of makeup maybe that's my Amish roots coming out I don't know but I have recently gotten into skincare and have been doing this five step routine with dime beauty products honestly I haven't really noticed a difference but I also don't really know what I'm looking for so maybe it's working and oh my gosh look how dirty this mirror is
