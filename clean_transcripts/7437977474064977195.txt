I get this kind of comment a lot on my stay at home mom content and it's really sad because to me it sounds like you're shaming dads instead of acknowledging the sacrifice that they are making for their family because a lot of dads don't want to miss out on time with their kids but it is sacrifice that they are willing to make in order to have a stay at home wife because there is so much value in having a wife at home who is taking care of the house and the kids so you can focus on work let me tell you about my husband specifically he owns his own business and has worked so hard to be able to have a flexible schedule so he doesn't miss out on time with his kids he is here for breakfast and lunch if we want him to be he will never miss an activity that the kids are in he is always willing to be there for his kids and he has worked so hard to make that happen so instead of shaming dads let's acknowledge and praise their sacrifice that they're making
