if you ever wondered why the pool renovation is taking so long it's cause I have to periodically stop for puppy cuddles obviously and if you're new here welcome to the series where I try figure out exactly how much punishment I can tolerate cause we renovating a 50 year old pool with no pool renovation experience which sounds like a terrible idea and probably is so far we‚Äôve stripped out the old tiles cleaned it popped up some new tiles and undercoated the coping with a lime wash paint one thing that I found about these tiles which is different to any other tile that I've used is it comes with an adhesive film on the front instead of a mesh backing and I cannot tell you how excited I was to peel that film off and I'm just gonna go ahead and assume that if you're here you like satisfying things as much as I do so I'm gonna leave you with this footage you're welcome and properly seeing the tiles for the first time really renewed my motivation for the whole project it's giving Mermaid it's giving Rainbow fish which I recently learnt is probably the most problematic book of my entire childhood but still, I like his scales and then it was time to grout and I won't lie I found this step pretty challenging we're using an epoxy grout epoxy? epoxy? we're using a grout that's apparently appropriate for pools but it is so fkn sticky like stickier than any other grout that I've ever used in my entire life and I've definitely used at least three so I'm basically an expert anyway this went on for a number of days and when I got sick of that I remembered I needed to stop for puppy cuddles to delay the project slightly longer I also remembered that I needed to paint the coping all over again love that for me she's 10 hours in and has 10 hours to go and I wish I was exaggerating I will say if you have lower back issues maybe delegate this role because it turns out being sat on your üçë on the hard concrete for 20 hours while bending over painting is actually not that good for people with back pain ask me how I know but now I'm toying with the idea of putting like a baby blue stripe around the coping please somebody talk me out of it in the meantime enjoy the moment where I realise that my husband and father in law are the exact same person and I'm so sorry but please come back for the update
