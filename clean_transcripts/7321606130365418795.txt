I just had the most amazing, relaxing shower. And it was because of these little things. Little shower steamers. Shower steamers. You put. You open it up and it's like a little disc and you put at the end of your thing and it releases all this beautiful scent. Aromatherapy scent while you're taking a shower. Oh, my god. 10 out of 10. Highly recommend the link right here if you wanna buy some. I do get a small commission.
