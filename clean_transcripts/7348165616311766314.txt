and literally says I'm being wrongfully evicted by you and I'm gonna call the cops he has no lease so a lot of girls need to realise when these hobosexuals wanna come they wanna like crash on your couch cause their ex is so crazy blah blah blah they are gonna become a squatter they will eventually claim that they are a tenant in that house you will get in trouble for your lease or you won't be able to kick them out if you're the one that owns the house because now they have a legal right to say I'm a tenant in this house so even when you wanna break up with them you're gonna have a really fucking hard time getting rid of them because now it's not about a boyfriend girlfriend thing it's about fucking legal tenancy and like leases and shit so do not let a fucking homeless man crash on your fucking couch for the same reason
