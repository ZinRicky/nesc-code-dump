I Afterpayed a bunch of building materials from Bunnings recently because I have another abandoned space which I haven't yet shown you and I don't think I could live with it for another day this is my horrendous hallway and honestly I hate it here if you don't already know we're renovating every single part of our 67 year old house and renovations can be expensive, and thatâ€™s where Afterpay really comes in clutch as my son would say because I can have the materials now do the renovation now and pay it off in 4 installments being able to Afterpay from Bunnings is a renovator's dream We started by demolishing the hallway essentially before the sparkies came to prewire then my husband insulated he put new drywall up which we called GIB here he plastered he popped up the panelling he primed it honestly this man is out here doing the most and I chose this beautiful opulent reddy brown colour called Tiki Tiki from Dulux Sparky came to do the final fit off quick reminder of where we started and this is where we are now thanks to Afterpay if I turn off the down lights this is how it looks it's so warm and cosy and welcoming Just pretend for a sec that I've got cream colour carpet cause that will eventually happen and we'll decorate this space in another video
