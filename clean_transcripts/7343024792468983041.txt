which stirred up some painful emotions and past trauma one of them, miles, there's love family self acceptance she deserved that jail time and my mom currently has the physical copy of this book this book had me hooked from the first page she fights to reclaim her life and her very identity okay this book was a hot mess and they have an instant attraction she uncovers some journals written from her teen self it's a story of love and ambition and the ambitious families living in the this one's not your typical romance novel but I pretty quickly realised that it was a ‘teen thriller’ it's mainly about fame okay but still This next review is ruthless and true love final book and it was a complete opposite of forbidden desires it is still fiction serving under King Henry XIII it's a mind bending and apparently Coleen Hoover didn't wanna write this one and to be honest social climbing what I thought it was gonna be spoiler alert but yeah quick so please don't hate me it was a quick but the readers were desperate so let's quickly review everything I've read this year it's an interesting book with a few good twists while slowly her perfect life unravels we first meet Tate when she moves in with her brother but in jail she had a baby And I get that you're hurting miles but it didn't have me on the edge of my seat “desperate for a crumb of your affection” sexuality power race so maybe I just wasn't the target market I enjoyed unravelling the mystery and it did keep you guessing like for a thriller you may as well read this one too I like the premise but I did buy the next one in the series it's a story of healing and what happens when one woman climbs too high and it makes you questioning who the real villain is and she just… lets him? representation she wants to be part of that child's life gets caught up in an identity-stealing serial-killers twisted web but overall I found it a very predictable read Kenna is our main character with (another) tragic backstory but important to know it wasn't very thrilling this book fkd me up for weeks but she still somehow finds time to fall in love and find hope gender wealth she's met with struggle after struggle hope growth and boundaries it is about the seven husbands but miles can't do serious because of his ‘mysterious past’ and she's trying to move forward and creating new life twisted thriller of a read definitely tugged on my heart strings still a good night easy read don't get me wrong but if you read the first one but this book just dragged on they're all shitty people he pushes her away and gets to know a group of his pilot buddies Lily has a trouble past and get a bit of closure and the story flips between now and then drama shock hope Tate is basically devoid of all self respect she's trying to rebuild her life after she made a horrific high schooler Pip fights to uncover a cold case power and rivalry The motherhood aspect affluent 1500s English Tutor court this is what's next on the reading list and conspiracies he pulls her back in and it's giving so I felt obligated to read it but she's searching for closure after the recent passing of her father which I actually read last year and I don't wanna spoil anything mistake that lead to jail time breaking cycles and healing honourable mention goes to verity and I was left with so many questions easy mindless read and then this one is the sequel and it was nice to be able to pick up the next book in the series easy and fun read by reconnecting with family and finding love along the way it's a historical fiction that brings to life the tales of Mary and Anne Boleyn I definitely recommend and yeah emphasis on the hot and definitely tackled some tough topics my mother in law lent me this but it's no excuse to be a brooding man child searching to uncover the truth behind a series of events that lead to the unaliving of two fellow teens and while yes A hard working young woman, who craves stability in a normal life ignoring reality and getting lost in a good book surprisingly addressed to Ellen Degeneres?? conveniently lives across the hall in some parts I can't be the only one who enjoys I found this book on BookTok and bought it with zero research I struggled to put it down and yes it is based on history exceptionally well written and now five years on and she finds herself in a place she swore she'd never be
