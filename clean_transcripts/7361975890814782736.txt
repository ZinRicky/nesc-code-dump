at night during the day equity feels like something is being taken away from you we also don't need men anymore at shopping centres and men are gonna have to accept the new reality pretty quickly but that's bad news for people like you but really because you're already in a position of privilege becoming equal and they are killing us when they're not killing us they are objectifying us and coercing us men expect an unincor share of domestic labour in their homes the reason why men have to change is because they are violent this is about being equal in the bush or the woods depending on where you live to realise that this is an opportunity for them women are not gonna tolerate it anymore because you exist in the paradigm of privilege in various ways against women women are not safe in our homes you can't see your own privilege why does one party have to change to make the other party feel equal we live within a patriarchy but this is clearly a projection because you're clearly feeling something men who are evolved will do this for example which is why they're paid less anywhere no one is exempt because women will stand up for our rights all men will be left behind on our streets in our workplaces so we're gonna continue to see more and more male reactions that are violent women have the literacy to recognise male entitlement when they see it you're clearly feeling like you are now at a disadvantage men who are aggressive will not that's male entitlement this is a scourge on our country and on our world Doctor Zoe let's talk about it when this entitlement meets rejection and they will react with these kind of words and with violence women are not here for it anymore they are raping us when they're not raping us so all of this goes without saying that the patriarchy has also put men into women are not equal yet that goes without saying men don't value women as much in the workplace men are entitled they feel entitled to women's bodies and call it out and I'm sorry they get violent men's behaviour sexist language and everyday types of sexism are normalised so men don't really have a leg to stand on this is not about feeling equal we know our rights and we know what we deserve to step outside of their own boxes power is blind men need to wake up honest question as equals
