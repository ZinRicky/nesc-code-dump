This is just a piece of paper that means absolutely nothing. That is my bachelor's degree. Um, I graduated with honors. As to opens up a discussion on, does Education Equal Success or make you smart? Think everyone should be educated and have a very rigorous education. But the matter of reality today is that colleges are not a place of, um, rigorous education anymore. The saying when I was in college was these get degrees, see, is get degrees. You can do bare minimum. As long as you're not failing, you can get your degree. Ask the question, do you need college if you wanna be a traditional wife, a homie, etcetera? I would say no. Now, if you wanna go into a field where you actually do need a degree, like nursing or what I was going for, um, or like, medical things, then, yes, there's a lot of things in college that you don't actually need a degree for. College is a big excuse to party and live it up. And I think it is very detrimental in your young 20s when you should be laying the foundation for the rest of your life and being productive instead of sleeping around on weekends and getting belligerently drunk at bars. Anyways, don't let anyone make you feel bad if you don't wanna go to college.
