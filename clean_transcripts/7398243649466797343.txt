With Simone Biles cleaning up shop at the 2024 Olympics and walking away with a couple gold medals. And with Kamala Harris going neck and neck with Donald Trump and raising $200 million in the span of a week. Look, if you hate black women, this is not your season. If you don't like black women winning, I feel sorry for you. This is not your season, my friend. You are gonna have to go through some therapy and work through that, because black girls are winning this time around. I gotta tell you. So good luck with that.
