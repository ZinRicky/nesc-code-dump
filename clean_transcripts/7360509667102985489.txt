for the immense amount of labour this ignores the reality that without women in the war times that I'm talking feminism argues for equal rights and responsibilities as well for all genders because they were at war but I get it talk like they live in the Stone Age because being patriotic and glorifying war what are all the women gonna do when World War 3 comes around I'm Doctor Zoe and I have a PhD in digital feminist activism and that mythology lives on is an attempt to scare and shame women into not advocating for our rights like the main thing that we need Protection from is men things would not have gotten done and I wanna talk about it firstly it has to be strong in order to convince men that it's something worth doing so this is an outdated and frankly embarrassing um it means advocating for equal acknowledgement in all areas that it is inherently a male role to protect and serve and dying for for that matter fear of what will happen when women are finally recognised that's why women can now fight in the military if they want to like back to the First World and Second World War as we've seen in Gaza when they're working very hard to desperate attempt to uphold gender stereotypes fear of what equal rights and equal responsibilities really mean in regards to undervaluing and under appreciating women's efforts in the war like if you're gonna die from an unnatural cause you'll see that mythology lives on and continue to put in to ensuring our society is safe women looked after the homes and women took on the paid work I think it's quite funny that men on this podcast and all of that your partner or ex partner we wanna serve and protect it's like from what weaponizing outdated gender stereotypes I'm not sure how the military would feel about you um soldiers and war sacrifices they are not maybe if you keep going women are warriors women are leaders like you like from men like in the contemporary context and this kind of implies that women are less able like we're not living in caves where there are predators like stop talking like these things are realities right now um in the very real so why is this misguided and what does it reveal about gendered stereotypes we will go back to the stage and then we'll see and then we'll see to actually convince people to do it in the first place who do you think did all the nursing who do you think stayed home and did all of the labour that men couldn't do it's most likely going to be at the hands of a man but the Assumption that men need to protect women is patronising feminist advocacy and activism is not gonna change just cause we're in a war is equitable is good to live in wartime or otherwise and I'm sure that they would and will if required in a military context reinforces the idea that women are inherently weak and in need of Protection around how awesome it is to fight in a war like it's the main threat to us like women need protecting very non hypothetical world that we do currently live in it is a red herring and it detracts from real issues that we face but bringing up like this hypothetical kind of war drafting who's gonna protect them but this type of commentary reflects outdated notions as a woman between the age of 14 and 44 and I'm honestly so well I this is all about fear and this includes in military context it has to women always have been but all I see are scared little boys here feminism is not about avoiding our responsibilities as women and is really would that like all and we're not living in World War 2 cause they were at war women did women raised the children including the military unfortunately the jobs that men could no longer do and this argument falls apart under any real scrutiny we're coming up to Anzac Day here in Australia um I guess undo the mistakes of the past is a big part of patriarchy because it's a big part of the lie that we're told and effort we have put in and capable to protect and serve we have to there has to be pretty strong mythology in response to feminist discourse on Equality wars disproportionately affect women you gonna wish you weren't so mean to men cause you need us a common but very flawed argument
