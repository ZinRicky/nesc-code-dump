so I love composting and gardening but my chickens love to spread my compost pile everywhere so to solve this problem I grabbed a tumbling compost container I'm gonna keep this right here in the garden so when I'm done with the compost I can just dump it straight out into the garden beds so I'm gonna start off on the first side I'm gonna add my brown ingredients in for my compost it's gonna be like dried grass cardboard and some dead plants then I'm also gonna add in some greens and this is gonna be some fruit that the chicken started eating from the garden some manure and I'm gonna just get spinning and then hopefully in a few weeks I'm gonna have some beautiful compost to put in the garden if you have chickens this is a must for the garden
