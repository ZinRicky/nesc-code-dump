my kids are growing up in home that is vastly different from how I grew up and I have been having a lot of issues with my daughter she's pushing back testing boundaries really getting under my skin today I was on the phone with my mom talking about what's been going on and some of the different things that I'm trying to so we can get back on the same page and she looks at me on Facetime and says hmm I don't know how to parent that because you were an angel and you didn't act like that no mom I was traumatized
