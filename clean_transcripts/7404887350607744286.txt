today we're doing a scavenger hunt for reading you ask and you shall receive here is a way to make your all about reading curriculum fun and engaging today we did a word card scavenger hunt I put the word cards and letter tiles in little bags and hid them all around our house I gave each kid a blueprint of our house and numbered where I hid each bag we live in a builder grade home so I got the blueprints right off the builder's website but you could easily draw your own I gave my kids two options they could either go hunt for all of the bags at once and read at the end or they could stop and read them as they found them both kids decide to find them all and then read all of the cards at one time this worked fine for my second grader but my first grader was a little overwhelmed with the amount of word cards he had to do he is working on blends and some of his bags had 2 3 4 word cards in them because they fit that when I was planning I thought he would stop at each spot and read them as he went but that was not the case and it's okay trial and error that's what homeschooling is right so if you try this activity be mindful of that just for a little context I do one lesson of a a R a week so on day one I am teaching the skill I read the word cards and they use their letter tiles to spell all the words the scavenger hunt was a really great day when activity because I could hide the word cards and the letter tiles together my kids had a blast doing this and asked if we could do it again tomorrow
