I've learnt two things since filling up our pool the first is at the precise moment that that final drop of water hits your entire extended family is gonna spontaneously show up and you're not gonna be able to get anyone out of the pool which is lovely but not very good for after shots and the second is after six weeks of slaving away under the beating hot sun the moment that you're done the weather will pack in and you won't really feel much like swimming anyway Murphy in the fkn laws I'll tell ya so all of that to say I can confirm the pool is full and I think it looks incredible but if I'm gonna show you her I wanna show you her in all of her glory so I'm so sorry but we just have to wait a tiny bit longer until the weather plays ball and in the meantime I thought we could check up on the garden progress because this really is my happy place and some of those aforementioned guests are staying for dinner and now I need to figure out how I'm gonna feed 10 people we got our first cucumbers of the season and they were so sweet we got some dills some kale a whole lot of courgettes Basil, coriander and lettuce and all of the strawberries and peas were eaten by the kids over the weekend so we've got none today and my tomatoes are only just starting to come on I thought I'd grab some flowers for the table but I don't know if I filled you in on my plan for this area this whole mess is actually in the pool area and it has to change and doing the pool itself was only phase 1 of my master plan of trying to make this area not look like a public pool and as much as I'd like to be done for the year there's still so much more to do so if you wanna see how it transforms you know what to do but for right now I've got to turn this into dinner
