I know we talk about different phases of parenting and especially how hard like the little years are but there's something so rewarding about when your kids get to an age where you can like watch them thrive in an activity that they are talented in we've tried a lot of activities as the kids were little you know seeing what sticks and we're finally at an age where each kid has found something that really really like they feel confident in they love doing and they're like naturally talented at and this is why I love like the one week camp thing it's inconvenient timing wise but you get to try so many different types of activities so for example my daughter last year did a theater camp and now she is like super into Broadway super into musicals starting to do theater in the fall and my son has really taken to skateboarding and skateboards with his dad and we go to the skate park as a family and I just love this phase of parenting and getting to see your kids like become their own people and although we look at activities as things that enhance our life not define our life it is really cool to watch them grow in their confidence and their interests
