My eczema has been flaring up so bad lately. I've not been taking care of myself. I've been really stressed, so my palms always tend to look a little bit rough. I take the C D S. 0 1 daily. Symbiotic you can take in this little travel container, which I do. I always do two pills in the mornings, and it's so good for my gut. Is a 24 strain probiotic blend. Helps me with feeling bloated. And every time that my skin gets bad, I look at my gut, what I'm eating, and what I'm putting into my body, and I see a massive difference when I use seed and when I don't. So if any of you guys want to try seed and you felt bloated, or your skin hasn't been great, or you just feel all around sluggish, a lot of the times, it's worth it looking at your gut and looking into taking a good probiotic.
