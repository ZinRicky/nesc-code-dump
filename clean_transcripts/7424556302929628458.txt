as someone who lives a pretty on the surface traditional housewife lifestyle who comes from a completely different background and ideological value system I cannot let this topic go so if you are done with it you can scroll on totally valid um but if you'd like to continue unpacking it you can sit right here cause I see a lot of the critique of the tradwifes online and I have posted my own but the difference is when I post my own critique of Tradwife propaganda videos and accounts it's coming from a person who very much lives a similar lifestyle I'm a stay at home mom I'm a homeschooling mom I cook from scratch I have a garden I understand the value of these like domestic skills and domestic pursuits a lot of people who post critique of tradwives are completely dismissing that part and therefore a lot of people won't even listen to the rest of the message because it just is once again coming from this like feminist lens of devaluing these sorts of lifestyles and I feel like if we're gonna have a meaningful conversation you can't just dismiss someone's entire way of living as something that they're brainwashed into that being said a lot of these creators are Mormon and I listen to other creators who are former members of the LDS Church or former tribe wives themselves not on that sort of like background but I come to this life from a completely different background number one I'm Jewish so we have a completely different ideological like value system when it comes to husband wife household that sort of stuff even with that my family was not like devoutly Orthodox or religious my mom was a working physician for my whole life in fact education and career is so important within the Jewish community that I grew up in that it was almost like looked down upon to become a stay at home mom so I never at any point looked at being a housewife or stay home mom as a calling or something that god was commanding me to do and yet somehow here I am three kids in living a very similar life and I think that's the conversation that needs to be furthered people who are living this life but somehow are not trapped into this trad life label because of the value systems that they have behind it the idea of equal partnership the idea of domestic labor the understanding that a lot of economic forces are why a lot of women become stay at home moms now not necessarily lack of career ambition um about the wage inequality about the lack of maternal leave you know people find themselves in this position in this life for a lot of different reasons other than religious indoctrination and if you're gonna start a conversation that critiques Trad wife lifestyles or at least belittles it you're shedding a lot of ears that would necessarily probably agree with a lot of the things that you're saying cause you can be a feminist and still like to bake bread and you can be an equal partnership and still have a day to day that looks similar to me and my husband you can be pro choice and have a bunch of children and maybe not have an abortion for yourself and maybe you have had one but that's what makes Tribe Life content so interesting because it's not that they're just living this lifestyle they're living this lifestyle based on a value system women should submit to their husbands that being a mother is the greatest calling for women that every pregnancy is a god willed event that you should not interfere with and I truly believe that that is where the danger lies in this sort of content it's not homemaking and homesteading um it is the ideology behind it that can lead to the oppression of more women whether or not you feel oppressed in this lifestyle almost doesn't matter if you're advocating for this lifestyle for everyone because it it goes without saying that someone would feel very trapped and oppressed buy a stay at home parent lifestyle I'm not even as anyway as hardcore as ballerina farms because I enjoy childcare and alone time and my husband's getting a vasectomy
