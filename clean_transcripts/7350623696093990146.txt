men rule the world they're in charge of everything I think we just need a little place to get do you think that spaces that are designed specifically for women are discriminatory that's exactly what a Tasmanian court is currently debating I'm Doctor Zoe and I start my PhD at the school of design specifically looking at gender and place so I obviously wanna talk about it now if you're not familiar with Australia there's that little triangle at the bottom which is called Tasmania Tasmania has a pretty famous art gallery called Mona and in that art gallery is something called the Ladies Lounge it is a lounge where you get served champagne and you get to relax on velvet couches and it's only for people who identify as women so one man went to Mona and he soon discovered that he would not be allowed access into the ladies lab so what did he decide to do he decided to take the artist to court for discrimination because he feels it's unfair that he doesn't get to experience the artwork and he also thinks that men should be able to experience it or that women should have to pay more for access to the entire art gallery because they get access to more spaces than men do in the art gallery but that's not actually true men do get to experience the artwork just as much as women do not in the same way but just as much as women do men get to experience what it feels like to feel excluded from certain spaces men get to experience what it feels like to pay the same but get less men get to experience what it feels like to be jealous of the level of comfort that another gender get to experience men get all of those things as a part of the artwork and if men were allowed in the ladies lounge then it wouldn't be the artwork so why should women have to pay more for something that men also get to experience just because men might not like it as much as women is art there to be liked enjoyed or is art there to make us ponder think question I hope that these are the things that the judge considers but the thing that really gets me about this case is that it's men who invented gender segregation in the first place there is a seat in the city of Melbourne that is for ladies only that was designed by men there are still clubs that only get to be experienced by men even Rotary International uh I think until recently all men might still have some male only but of course we know that women are still excluded from many leadership positions but this was formalised until relatively recently women were not allowed in certain spaces of leadership or government women weren't allowed in pubs women weren't allowed bank accounts and even though we're now allowed in these spaces have you ever walked into a pub and just felt completely like it's not for you like you feel unsafe you feel overly perceived you don't feel comfortable because there's this underlying um energy that it's not for you I really hope that the court finds that the Ladies Lounge can continue to operate because I think that it will set a really interesting precedent in the court system one that doesn't already exist which is why this is such an interesting case it will set a really interesting precedent for the way that space and gender and discrimination intersect and I believe it will set a precedent that basically says that these types of spaces can exist under certain circumstances IE for equity reasons rather than for discriminatory reasons either way I think it's really excellent that the artist is choosing to use this moment as an extension of the artwork itself it's basically performance art every interview she is giving every um court appearance she has she's using it as an extension of the artwork to make the point prove that point continue that point double down and I love it so much
