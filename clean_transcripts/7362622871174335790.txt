you don't have to be plus size to experience fatphobia and I think that that concept is one of the reasons why people gravitate towards the term mid size so often even if they're not actually mid size I just made a video like going into detail about the term mid size but basically the only people that actually should be calling themselves mid size (if they want) are people in that like in between between straight sizes and plus sizes Iâ€™ll come online and I'll see someone who's like literally a size medium call themselves mid size that's not what that word means you could still be curvy and straight size I'm gonna use my girl Nicola as an example first of all I love this woman so much I do not play about her and I think she's a perfect example of it because she often gets called plus size because she is curvy and specifically has had a rounder face but she's like a very small human being she's very petite so despite her being curvy I don't think that she would actually fall into the category of plus size clothing again someone can correct me if I'm wrong but I'm like pretty sure I'm not and so I think people that have this experience where they are not like Societal's idea of what like being skinny and thin is but they are not like fat like me fat like plus size fat so they gravitate towards this term mid size and I understand again why people use it and because she exists in a curvy body she does experience fatphobia but she's still straight sized does that make sense to clarify just because she's not technically plus size doesn't mean you can't see her as representation because like despite us being very vastly different sizes I still do really love her and appreciate seeing her on my screen and feel represented by her because like film and TV is so specific about the bodies that they do show us and uplift on screen that anybody outside of that norm is beautiful representation in my opinion anyways again I'm using her as an example this is not like an invitation to like say anything negative about her or her body I love that woman with my whole heart yeah I just wanna show you as an example that like you don't have to be plus size or even mid size to experience fatphobia and be impacted by fatphobic beauty standards like you could still be straight size and experience all of that
