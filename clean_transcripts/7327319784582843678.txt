Okay, so at the outside I'm not necessarily responding to this person or this comment. I typically don't for two reasons. One, the vast majority of Americans support abortion access. I don't need to convert anybody, so it's just generally not worth my time. 2. It's also not worth my time to engage with these male like, thoughtless allegations that aren't grounded in either policy or women's experiences and are basically just an attempt to shame women for what is largely men's irresponsible ejaculations. I did come on here to say though, but it always dumbfounds me how like men across the world commit approximately 80% of all violent crime. Depending on the location of the type of crime, that number can be a lot higher. So for example, in the United States, 98% of all mass shooters are men. So for starters, it seems likely that if men could get pregnant that they literally would have abortions for fun. Like they accuse women of doing that even though there's no research to support it. Um, but like, they kill alive independent people for fun. Like a lot women pregnant women. So despite that reality and the fact that zero of them have any first hand experience with abortion, none of them have ever needed one, they still think that they get to label what an abortion is and is not. It's such a sad, pathetic. And ability to decenter yourself and acknowledge that you like obviously as a fact don't Know what you're talking about
