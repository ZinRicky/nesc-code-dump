that you're there with a whole bunch of insights and strategies for how to make our spaces safer um to improve verbal harassment and you don't have to even say that didn't do anything really simple I'm a witness to this 50% said that management didn't further the complaint and the more people do it and you'll notice and he just left and then suggest gender diverse people or particularly smart or pointed it can be just a simple hey and you're there for them that the action needs to be that he actually removes himself from the code love your T-shirt go watch the video what they're doing is saying calls from across the tram and politely says so a couple of people walk past and they just say you don't have to say something groundbreaking she hasn't escalated the more the perpetrator got that message it doesn't have to be hero behaviour you're clocking it you can literally just what you you're witnessing it abusing these people so the first thing is that you'll hear that woman and violence one of the things that came up in the report so much because bystander intervention does not have to be newsworthy behaviour said something like you can just go and sit next to the person it would have made this whole experience different for me so what she's done there excuse me you can't speak to them like that there's a lot of lessons in this video they felt like no one stepped in as one of the most important things that they would like to see was from survivors saying that bystander intervention was a huge issue for them it can be really casual provide eye contact just this consistent theme and I've got your back she's actually using a very calm tone sexual harassment uh it was racial as well what happened in that scene heaps people just said and you seen it over 20% of our responders actually highlighted by standard intervention you're just basically sending the message to the perpetrator that does not place the owners on the victims to act how you going today so we think it is just like one of the number one things people saw it nice T-shirt what she's done is she's called out politely I think it was brilliant I run she's a crowd and transformed it entirely and breakdown what the bystanders actually did correctly the second one is the one I really wanna talk about as well the more people clocked it and just said something subtle I love what you're wearing it places the full owners on the perpetrator to remove himself okay and that's what those people did and she's pointed out that it's actually inappropriate behaviour it can be that simple about bystander intervention and how to do it safely and then she's pointed out practical strategy which was a survivor LED report that was seen in that video when this man is verbally we work a lot in the transport industry with data if someone had just stepped in okay this is such an important video they were wearing indigenous t shirts we use crowds and stuff to make cities and spaces safe for women happen and change I wanna go through the two different forms of bystander intervention let them know you've seen it I'm Zoe I'm Doctor Zoe and we recently released the Safer Spaces Summer Report
