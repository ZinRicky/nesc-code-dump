Let's make my blue collar husband's lunch. I'm making a chicken Alfredo sandwich with bacon. And one way to make sure the breads does not get soggy is I toast it in a cast iron skillet. They do is just take shredded chicken, some Alfredo sauce and slap your mama seasoning and mix that all together. Chop up your bacon and add it to the mixture. Assemble together your sandwich and you're good to go. Lunches really do not have to be gourmet. They really can be as simple as this. And man, are they delicious.
