and I was like no we see the falls incredible beautiful stunning I really am terrified I am so scared and everyone in the back is just like having a great time having a chat Catcher Falls and the only way to get to this huge waterfall oh 100% I'm being 100% serious tryna be super like aha yeah it starts spitting with rain and he's like I really couldn't tell at this point if he was being serious or not kind of that have come over up ahead I was wearing like shorts and my bare legs the whole time like this guy seems insane like I don't know anything we'll run out of fuel um do you have a boyfriend and I was just like no that I've never shared on here but this story demonstrates why women choose the bear it just means that we might not be able to like land the plane and I was like that person was me I don't think I particularly wanted to and he was like well I don't wanna have a ghost in plane it's like so loud and he's like well and the pilot who's this man says to me like like for my life and for my friends like I don't know if you're being serious like be real with me right now this pilot is like literally just staring at my legs like at my I literally was in fight or flight like I was in flight but it's not that extreme like someone had to sit in the front seat with the pilot I'm just like 20 and like yeah it was pretty scary um but the problem with that is um that's in the middle of the jungle oh rain's not good with a tiny plane like this and he's like alright okay great so what do you mean by that um you know what I went to Guyana when I was 20 years old and I was in the middle of the jungle alright yeah that's like a problem and I was like why don't you have a ghost during the plane like I don't know anything about planes what an abuse of the situation he had me in so we're all in this tiny plane together suck up to him and powder to him if this storm really kicks off I think it was like a nine or 10 seater plane and me and the group I was with so cute so fun ha ha and I was just like oh for fuck sake and I can't believe I've never shared it we might have to go to the capital and landed there instead and basically made me steer the plane and I'm feeling increasing uncomfortable stormy clouds um like ha and I'm just having this conversation with this pilot and he's like I see all those clouds like um and I was there freaking out and I'm like seeing all this storm cuts ahead this plane is like one of those planes where you've got to wear like earmuffs one person had to sit in the front and then he puts his hand on my leg and I'm there freaking out and I'm like I don't wanna freak them out and that is why we choose the bear it was all fine we survived but there I was in the front seat next to the pilot and he's like but if we get here's my number I gave him fake number and was just being super cute he's like go on and then and if I don't make him think he's got a shot with me well you have to give me your number or I won't land the plane then you have to and I was like okay where we have to panda and we have to fawn just to keep ourselves safe you can just feel yourself moving through the sky like never again I have to literally be nice to this guy and everyone else is in the back of the plane that's hours and hours away like by car there's like a little dirt runway and then he's like so I'm just like sure okay and I'm just there steering this plane freaking out and then he goes and that is what I'm talking about making me feel really uncomfortable because these are types of situations that women find themselves in with men and I was like are you kidding me right now in the pilot seat so we get there and I was like hey and then on the way back someone had to decide decided we wanted to go and visit one of the biggest waterfalls in the world then I don't know what he's gonna do but what an abuse of power super sweet tryna stay super calm cause he has got me in such a situation that I'm literally terrified for myself I can't be having this converse he landed the plane and I just got the hell out of there and I know this is like an extreme example because we were in the air because we don't have enough fuel in the plane to get us there and I'm trying to stay calm I think I've blocked it out of my memory because it was crazy so for whatever reason like I don't I I is to take to charter a really small plane like I genuinely don't know if we'll be able to land this plane and we take off on the runway and I can see that there's all these dark what do you mean that's problem I just thought of the craziest story that happened to me
