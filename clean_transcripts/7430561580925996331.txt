Our house has become the neighborhood hangout house. And today, I'm gonna be the cool mom. I'm gonna give them some slime. This is a 24 pack of slime, so every kid will get their own outside, of course. Comes in these little balls. I'm gonna take the plastic off of it to make it easier for them. They each can get their own little slime ball to play with outside. It's Galaxy Slime, so it's got a bunch of different colors inside of it. Super fun to play with outside.
