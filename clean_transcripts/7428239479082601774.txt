there is finally a chill in the air which means it is time to start layering our outfits because I am a skirt and dress girly all year round and the only way I can do that is by layering smartly so I usually start off with a pair of leggings or tights under my dresses under my skirts and this year I am rocking these swiftmay I just found them they are fleece lined and flesh colored so it looks like a sheer pair of tights which is my preferred type of tight so then when we add our little booties you would never know that I'm wearing fleece lined leggings not sheer tights these will give me the look of wearing like a sheer layer but still be completely warm in even like 30 inches of snow so these are gonna be on the rotation for all of my skirt and dress outfits for the winter and fall you can find them in the link in my bio go get yourself a pair and stay warm this winter
