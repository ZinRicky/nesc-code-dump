I couldn't think of a better way to start off a birthday weekend than with a wine tasting dinner at powder at the Waldorf Astoria Park City the dinner was the first event of the Park City Wine Festival and it was called Rustic Reds which was a five course pear dinner and red wine seminar hosted by Wine Academy of Utah chef came out and explained every dish that he paired with each red wine as we went through the courses they were each paired beautifully in the somillier explained each wine with so much fun and energy everyone had a great time this was a fantastic start to the Park City Wine Festival and my birthday weekend
