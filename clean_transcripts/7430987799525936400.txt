I think we've finally done it we've finally bitten off more than we can chew so welcome to side quest No. 798 where we attempt to renovate a 50 year old pool with no pool renovation experience and instead, should I be focusing on my creepy laundry makeover? probably but am I also very easily distracted by shining new side quests you already know the answer to that and as you can see this pool for lack of a better phrase is fkd Itâ€™s filthy for starters we've got tiles coming off paint coming off holes in the plaster and an algae infestation but like everything else that we found in this house she's got fantastic bones she just needs a little.. shaping ðŸ’… and this is a sentence I don't say often it's enormous it's about 10 metres long five metres across and well over two metres in the deep end and she's made of concrete so she's a sturdy girl We had a great summer here last year but we decided that by the time summer rolled around again we were gonna have done some work on the pool and summer's coming so we better get to first step was to drain it and Goldie was deeply curious about the circles on the bottom which are left over from previous repairs and I just wanna let you know that we haven't gone into this project completely blind We had multiple pool people come over and give us their thoughts we've had experts come and check out all of our pipes and pumps and make sure that they're all good And prior to starting the aesthetic work we did have one pump in the spa replaced but that was only because one of the kids thought it would be a good idea to post a sinkie into so the boys and by boys I mean my husband and my eldest son made a start by chipping off all of the existing waterline tiles and these are obviously a gorgeous vintage tile we did actually go down the route of exploring whether or not we could salvage them and we hunted and hunted but we couldn't find a match and the reality is they're really just hanging on by a thread at this point so they did need to go and I have got an idea in mind about how I might be able to upcycle them so that they can continue to live on here at the pool but I'll have to keep you posted on that so anyway you've just seen Mark remove about 16,133 tiles which I find oddly satisfying and I don't know what it is about this man he loves to vacuum but only on a job site I don't know if anyone wants to know the history but I personally find it fascinating this pool was put in about 20 years after the original home was built I think around a similar time that they built the extension and if I have my facts straight at the same time there were also horses roaming around this property it was definitely a homestead at one point but it has been subdivided if I understand correctly the mum was an avid swimmer maybe even competitive? which explains this massive pool by the way I'm posting in real time and there is still so much to do so you have to come back I'm sorry!!
