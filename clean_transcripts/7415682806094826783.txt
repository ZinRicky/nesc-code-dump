I mean, you're wearing a crochet blanket. It just also has arms like it. So the arms are a little baggy, you know what I mean? There's no give, but they are big. They also, for me, I'm a little bit tall. They don't come all the way to my wrist, do you know what I mean? It's a little short, so sometimes I even just do this. It. For me, I'm wearing it cause it feels like it's a blanket. But yeah, that's what the arms look like. And I also pull it up a little bit to make it feel like. And fold it. But the arms can be. I don't know. I hope I'm showing you the arms good for me. They don't come all the way down. I don't know. Okay. I hope that's helping. Like, you can pull it. I can go like that. But then I kind of. And that's when it all kind of fell off my shoulder a little bit, so. But no, there's no flexibility. It's literally like just straight cotton yarn, you know what I mean? It is just. There ain't much to it. There's no. It's stretching because it's a crochet thing, you know what I mean? Because it's just Like, widening the pattern, but the fabric itself does not have give. No. I super hope that helps.
