so for a long time I have been on the page that a lot of young people are getting on now when it comes to elections where I have never really cared about elections the Republicans and the Democrats are basically the same and so when people started talking about how they're not gonna vote for Biden this year they're not gonna vote for Biden because of what's going on you know üçâüçâ I'm not I don't wanna name it because then my content will get buried but I was all about that I was really like oh my god finally like the young people are realizing that elections don't matter elections are fucking you know fanfare it's political circus but now I'm thinking about abortion rights when I think about the two most pressing issues happening within the United States um I think about covid which if you are covid reckless if you are not covid cautious don't do not come at me in my comments if you're out at these protests and you're not wearing a mask do not come at me in my comments the two most pressing issues to me in the United States are covid and disability justice and abortion rights and abortion rights is that's where it gets me um if you follow and you should you should follow Jessica Valenti she writes the newsletter Abortion Every Day every single day I get that email in my inbox and I am terrified at the news um but it's important to be armed with that knowledge right I worry that if we you know get a Republican in office because we did not vote for a Democrat and this again this is not a get out the vote video I don't even know if I'm gonna go out and vote yet um and historically again I have not cared about voting but when I think about abortion rights and I think about the possibility of a Republican president implementing federal anti choice laws when I think about Trump getting into office and implementing a federal abortion ban of some kind which obviously would avalanche into complete and utter fascist dystopia when it comes to abortion rights I am starting to think okay maybe it would be a little advantageous just a little bit just to help us mitigate fascism just a little bit to keep a Democrat in office and then bully the fuck out of them to make them do what we want them to do because that's what has always changed things is direct action organizing right so these are just my thoughts and I would really love to hear your thoughts respectfully and again if you‚Äôre not wearing a mask in public stay out of my fucking comments
