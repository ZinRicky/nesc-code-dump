Did you guys know about trad wives? they're very much not a new thing “trad wives” aka traditional housewives have been around for a long time in fact I would say that this country is rooted in traditional housewives There are women out there that wanna cook clean and do everything for their man they don't complain and they're all usually attractive feminine They like when the man leads This isn't a new thing This has been around for ages There’s a huge pool of women who now are opening up to that idea that it’s okay to be feminine It’s okay to be a housewife It’s okay to put their husband needs above anybody else's TRAD wives are getting so much heat and honestly it's for the wrong reasons These women are happy, these women are thriving and so is their relationship I think the traditional housewives pool is only gonna continue growing women who get true joy by taking care of their partners
