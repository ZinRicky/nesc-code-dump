For all my girlies that love fall, this little shacket. I didn't know it was a thing, but this is a jacket. It's not a shirt, it's not a jacket. Oh, it's like instant snuggle perfection. I fucking love this thing. I absolutely love it. I think it's the cutest little addition to cute little outfit. Just like, throw it on really quick and it is kind of perfect cause it's not. I took my dog for a walk. It's not hot enough for a fucking full sweater. That's like just light enough to just give you just, oh, just a little snuggle. And then it makes it feel all the fall vibes. Oh my god, I love it, I love it, I love it.
