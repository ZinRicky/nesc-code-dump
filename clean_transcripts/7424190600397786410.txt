this is what leaving it up to the states and but there are exceptions actually looks like in practice we're having debates as to whether women with cancer in abortion ban states who need to get an abortion so that they can access cancer treatments actually fit under these states exceptions for the life of the mother because the abortion wouldn't have saved her life it would have only extended it strict abortion bans are forcing doctors to engage in these crazy linguistic debates about people's very real lives cause every time they do provide an abortion they are risking prosecution by the states and risking up to five years in prison I rarely highlight horrible people in my comments but this comment actually demonstrates what a lot of actual Republican legislators think about this issue they are fighting for fetal personhood bills meaning that the moment you conceive whether consensually or not you are carrying a legally defined person with constitutional rights they're actually fighting for the fetus to have more rights than the woman because in the United States for example we don't have a duty to save so you could walk by and see be a baby face down in two feet of water and you have no legal obligation to go in and save that child we don't force alive or dead people to donate organs despite all the people who die waiting on the organ donor list we don't force people to give blood but women they say are different we should have to sacrifice our life our ability to access cancer treatment because we are pregnant I also don't appreciate the fact that if she dies the fetus dies with her but that's all intentional they work overtime to try to act like these are two completely independent beings vote blue up and down the ballot like your life depends on it because for a lot of us our life does depend on it I'm the feminist lawyer follow me if you enjoy being miserable
