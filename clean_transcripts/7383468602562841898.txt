We're back in LA for the next two weeks after having lived here for three years, and in a way, everything feels so nostalgic to me. I tried to wake up before my older kids do, which doesn't always work, but today it did. So I got my skincare routine in and ran lucky shower for him, trying to get him to use sunscreen, so I apply it for him every morning, and this one has been my favorite one. You guys know I need my hot cup of tea, so I did that next. Lately, it's been peppermint tea with some lemon and honey. After that, I hopped on a quick meeting before getting my kids dressed. My parents already fed them some breakfast, so this is their second breakfast, but they wanted some banana bread, so I got started on making that by mashing up some bananas, adding all of my wet ingredients before adding my dry ingredients. And some chocolate I chopped up, gave that good mix, popped that in the oven before setting the kids up with some coloring stuff so lucky and I could unpack our bags and get our closet organized. Usually leave everything in suitcases, but since we're gonna be here for a second, I decided to just unpack it all. After we unpacked everything, I got started on doing my makeup. I need to do my makeup in order to feel productive. I don't know what it is, but I mastered my Makeup routine to where only takes me 15 minutes every morning. Also, my lip combo is the Cork lip liner from Mac, a beniflora from benefit, and then whatever lip gloss I can find. Know what to wear this morning? But I decided on this little romper situation at this point. The kids wanted to swim in the pool, so that's what they did while I went back inside and pulled out my banana bread. I sliced them up a couple slices and also made them a little fruit plate I ended up eating. I'm trying my hardest to stay hydrated, so I always take my liquid IV wherever I go. They've come out with so many new flavors since I started using them, and I love having them on hand.
