if your co parent immediately moved a new mommy in and really try to drill it home to the kids to try to replace you let me encourage you it really doesn't matter how little the child is you are their mother they were created inside of you there is a natural bond that that child has with you they are never gonna see somebody else as Mama think of all the stories of people looking for their natural birth mother all these kids that got adopted it was beautiful story still but they still wanna try to find out who was their birth mother there is a connection between a mother and their child that cannot be broken here's another thing that will happen the kid might slip up and either call you this other woman's name or you might uh here through the Grapevine that your child is calling the other person mom either whether they slipped up or they're being taught to do that still doesn't matter it doesn't fucking matter I can call an elephant a raccoon it's not gonna make the elephant a fucking raccoon your kid could call their fucking cup mom it's not gonna make it mom it's the same fucking thing just because someone's teaching them or they're a little kid and you know the back and forth and all around sometimes you call your fucking teacher mom you know what I mean you can't let those tiny little things ever try to convince you that your motherhood is less than what it truly is and it is an undying connection between you and your child that is your child think of your mother whether you have a good relationship or not we always yearn for our mother that's why it hurts so bad sometimes you know so just remember that your baby loves you and it doesn't does not fucking matter who comes in their life
