so since I'm gonna be on the news tonight talking about the TikTok ban that is a sentence I never thought I would actually use I figured we should discuss it here first oh so sweaty and Charles right now now say what you want about the reported reasons for why they're trying to ban TikTok I really think it has to do with disseminating information and the US not getting a piece of the financial pie from a foreign company but when we talk about banning TikTok specifically there's something very nefarious about that because as we know if you are on here you are a TikTok user TikTok operates in a very different format than other social media programs platforms which is why people like me who are never like influencers before have become content creators on TikTok because it is a much more POV real life type of place real people are becoming big on TikTok by just sharing who they are granted the app is definitely definitely changing for the worse but for a lot of us it functions as a third space now what are third spaces in a community well you have your work which is your first place you have your home which is your second place flip those home first work second and then you have third places which are supposed to be communal spaces and countries that are much older than the United States partakes in third space community much more than the US does we have more of a suburban model whereas cities that were built before the use of cars and before a lot of the industrial revolution still have communal third spaces within walking distance from most people's homes ask yourself in the US if you live there um where can you walk to that doesn't cost money that you can be social the only one I can think of for myself is the public library and they're trying to ban those too so because we live in a world of suburbia and with a driver culture and a lack of third spaces we are lacking community in the United States and where have we found it where have we carved out a place to share information some good gossip and fashion tips the internet now in the early days of the internet when I was born people very much thought of the internet as public meaning you had to present in a certain way as we've gotten more comfortable with things like social media people are coming on here a lot more authentically and with that increased authenticity we have now formed a digital third space and this type of communal space doesn't really exist in the same way in places like shminstergram or the book of faces because on those platforms you still very much are performing so when people who don't use this app talk about banning it as not a big deal it's because they have not yet joined the digital third space community and they don't realise that humongous social distinction but if it happens if they ban it people are not gonna take that lightly
