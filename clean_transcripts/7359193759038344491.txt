If you don't have the courage to walk up to someone and say hey I think you're cute what's your name Can I get your number which to be frank is a little bit weird and generally creeps people out instead do this this is a great conversation starter trust me this pickup line has 100% success rate so do use with cautions It works, and it works a little too well I encouraged my friends to do this and it's foolproof Not only that, they met their now husbands using this advice what you do is you say have we met before you look really familiar do you go to (X) gym you do? what time do you go I must have seen you there maybe we can work out together sometime here's my number if they say no just say, oh you just have a really striking face or oh you seem like you're in great shape Are you sure we haven't seen each other before where are you from maybe we have mutual friends together can I get your Instagram well now that we've officially met I'd love to get your details and see you again can I get your number so we can talk again This doesn't just work for love interest this works for friendships too if you're afraid to put yourself out there then this is a great conversation starter it truly works and I do this all the time try this next time you see your crush or if you're simply out there trying to make friends
