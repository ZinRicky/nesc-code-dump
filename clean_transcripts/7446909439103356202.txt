Healthcare is a human right, and we should all be able to access the healthcare that we need in this climate. Especially women should know that they have options to get the best and most comprehensive healthcare available. That's why I'm so excited to be partnering with Hey Jane, the country's leading online clinic for women's reproductive and sexual health. Hey Jane offers safe, private, and discreet services for everything from obtaining birth control to abortion care, treating UTIs or other vaginal conditions without judgment. Hey Jane is currently available in 21 states, and all of their medications are sent in discreet packaging to ensure the privacy of their patients. And is available if you live in a home, a dorm, or PO Box. But for those of us like me who live in a stricter state like South Carolina, hey Jane has a bunch of resources on their site to help guide you both financially and logistically to your nearest safe state. So know that you have options. Hey Jane has helped over 70,000 patients and is committed to continuing to lead the charge to ensure access to women's healthcare. You're not alone. And women, we tend to help each other and we will continue to do so. So please share this information with the women in your life because it's so important for us to know what options we still have access to. And go check out all of Hey Jane's services on their website.
