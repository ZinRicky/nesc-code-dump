see that's the thing when I started this relationship is it started out as like these are my children you are my boyfriend yes we are all kind of a part of the same circle of people but like they're not your fucking kids I don't want you parenting them I don't want you doing anything like they're my kids I want I don't want them forming like all the best attachments and shit but you know what I mean I just don't want it getting all like that I don't wanna co parent with another fucking person so he knows full well I'm a single mom I take care of my kids it's more like I'm moving in with a roommate and I got kids I my life is kind of like a waffle it's all together but it's also very very separate and divided and that's how I like it I want it this way I feel safe I feel comfortable I feel protected and that's what matters most for me in my life so yeah I didn't want no guy trying to tell me you're not innocent man I'm sorry sir yeah so this relationship feels very comfortable safe and secure otherwise I wouldn't be doing this but I do love to hear other people's stories fucking these men
