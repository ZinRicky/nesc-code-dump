What I eat in a day as a mom on a time crunch and as someone who avoids seed oils, artificial sugars, dyes and preservatives at all costs. Breakfast is done in a flash with pasture raised eggs scrambled up. Lunch is leftover pasture raised chicken fajitas and a slice of freshly milled whole grain sourdough bread with bread butter that I I also made sure to take my whole food animal based blend of bioavailable vitamins and minerals from birthright tribute to optimal fertility and female hormonal health. Dinner was 100% grass fed beef meatball source from my parents farm, a fennel salad straight from my garden with Parmigiano Reggiano and simple dressing. And I had a probiotic coconut yogurt with bee pollen, berries and a drizzle of raw honey for dessert.
