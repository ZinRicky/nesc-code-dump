the mainstream media paired up with Big Pharma to gaslight the entire female population into thinking that birth control is pro Women's Health stated in an article from the Washington Post four days ago saying that this massive basically boycott of women getting off of birth control is because of misinformation from influencers a woman writing this article is also stating how testimonials are complaining about depression and anxiety when in fact new data shows us that adolescent girls are at a 130% increased risk of getting diagnosed with depression after getting on an oral contraceptive like we don't have mountains of research that it does indeed cause auto immunity and nutrient depletion and breast cervical and liver cancer calling this misinformation when most of this is actually clearly stated in the birth control side effect sheet that comes with your birth control she also goes on to talk about how right wing influencers are talking about how birth control impacts the family unit and gender roles when again studies show that it kind of does and then they also cited a male doctor who has never had a uterus talking about how all of these influencers are positioning themselves as expert speaking two things that science doesn't bear out like we don't read books written by actual doctors and experts in their field we don't have countless anecdotal accounts of women talking about how hormonal birth control totally messed up their life and health I can't say I'm surprised because honestly this is pretty on par for the mainstream media and big pharma but still it it burns the same I have been tracking my menstrual cycle for 5 years if you do it correctly it works as someone who was literally laughed at by doctors for having period problems and being told that I was too young to worry about it because I wasn't ready to have kids and also told to just go on birth control which literally made me feel like shit mentally and physically trust me you're not crazy no matter how much the doctors try to make you feel like you are
