so since we're all in the frozen tundra I wanna give you a little mom hack for reference I have three kids 9 7 and 2 and at the beginning of the season because that we always run out of or lose gloves and hats I buy a multi pack of plain black gloves and like neutral coloured beanies they fit all three kids and that way there's just a bin of hats and gloves and you can grab whichever ones work on the day
