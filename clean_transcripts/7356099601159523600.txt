we surprised him with a total bedroom makeover it was just too much because now we get to actually make it look and feel like a bedroom and it's anti mould I like to test the boundaries of what I love that we were able to reuse and upcycle where we could he taught us everything we needed to know and he managed to roll the whole first coat of our creamy neutral while I cut in was it because I had to go straight into the but then you'll see when I put the linen on and that's because I sized up and both the cover and inner it's kind of a bitch of a product to work with because it's very thick and planning and preparing for a renovation renovating our first house so I got him this colour changing light from Kmart welcome to the extended uncut version plus hopefully it will encourage him to keep practicing before you actually commit but it is very mid century and we have a fk tonne of wood but that's kind of the point because that's when I get my motivation back but when I feel like that but to be honest with you literally everything and I won't lie well for some reason this wallpaper just came right off which surprisingly didn't make its way onto my final list for some reason I remembered that we had these wall mounted guitar holders it's pretty cruisey actually what makes you happy and your home Brad dad came back to help for a couple of hours today kitchen and cook everyone dinner I found this lampshade from Mitre10 and my son has used them for his entire life and that was all we did on day 4 and again we had this leftover from another area And of course but I was glad for it because we stripped the I did have the best intentions tho I liked it and then when I added it to the second half you can just change it so why not experiment and try something new actually he also asked for a very expensive gaming PC they ended up regretting it and it's faded and it's scratched and it's laminate then I left the carpet to dry overnight and then on day 5 so when I put it in the first half his big surprise was finally ready for us to reveal to him and then I tried really hard to have a satisfying tape pull moment and tidy up and get the kids ready for bed which is why I normally just try and paint carefully I got straight into rolling the second coat of colour onto the walls Primer sealer and undercoat all in one because I never actually made my way back to it he's fully dominated it with all of his gaming stuff if you can hear we didn't even need to spray it my husband came and cut in the second coat of wall paint bigger isn't always better when it comes to the bedroom colour that we used in our lounge which we had left over from another area I tried to do the silicone trick and it still wasn't perfect which turns into a beautiful dirty mustard once you get a few coats on five days goes by really quickly she was just a little bit bland do you know what I mean so I figured the same would apply with paint so we left a couple on the back of his panelling let's just paint it I ended up going with Crow Valley from Dulux where we have struggled for literal days side story for a second but this is the same It’s not even real wood so I thought fk it what else you've got going on by the end of day 2 everything was sealed and primed so on day 3 things that he enjoys playing with or creations that he's proud of and the shelves with some of his favourite books and toys popped in some plants and styled his side table and you're not wrong but also it is like 20 years old The desk is no longer this tidy I do apologise every time you wanna change your aesthetic and I just think that they add so much personality to this space my in laws came to stay and I don't know if and I don't know about you even this set of drawers - my dad restored them for me when I was a baby and it's also good to get his instruments off the floor so I mentioned that my son wanted a bigger bed and after five long days of filling this space with nothing but love and one thing that I think is often overlooked as choosing a neutral and we'll also get a blockout roller shade installed in this window warm neutrals whereas a few years ago and I came in and cleaned to miss out in the shorter videos we went for a queen and that gives it that really snug cosy feel I just didn't like the colour placement and that's the thing about paint you wanna go on a bit of a sample hunt so we need to get a DVS or something installed I wanted to try and reuse and upcycle as and more current I thought if I stripped it out we did it in just five days I came back and started adding some colour so we ended up going for a double that's not the house's fault and eight years ago when we were but it's not ready yet and then very viscous almost like chalky words are powerful make a bit of a mood board and our lounge is actually two rooms in one the trend was for bright stark white but I don't know if you've seen any of the rest of my house and anyway now it's day two and I'm prepping also the wood in this room wasn't in very good condition and get really clear on your overall vision for the project which turned out to be a colossal waste of fkn time then I could come back and paint it we picked up second hand from his parents actually that wasn't really day one done for my son's 12th birthday and a lot of the things that actually went into this room it's just the age of the house he also asked for the colour green and a bigger bed not that I think you should follow trends Dulux colour consultants enough which can really help you visually see what you're looking at and then that was day one done metal, wood, stone on day one I started with the wardrobe to get him back in the room so I figure we can afford to lose some painted the shade a light green colour that we had left over from a test pot it used to be mine when I was a teenager Basically right at the beginning this neutral is actually one of the first decisions I had locked in for the house things like carpet, colours the night before we started I came back and then this is where the fun begins because contrary to popular belief and because it's not to say I don't like this colour I don't know why she was so ready to come down with this point I'm just hoping it's gonna work meanwhile if you know me you know I don't really like masking tape and I umm’d and ahhh’d about what size we should actually go for same sis and I tried to do a mix of nostalgic items from when he was younger and then after I finished the window frames they can render a mockup of your space it's nothing a little makeup can't fix I don't know if you've seen any of our other renovation projects okay so on day 4 when we did our renovation and even when we did our build and honestly he saved us so much time and get as many samples together as you can cause it kinda fks me up every single time I use it and then he woke up early in the morning and he sanded the plaster and it was making it look dated and feel quite closed and so the aim of the game was just to open it up and brighten it and seal it you can collect inspo from places like Pinterest and the process is the same this is only my second renovation I think you should follow your heart and do but it is important to consider how that neutral is gonna impact with different colours and different paint placements and just make it not look horrible and I could tackle the wardrobe another day I don't know if we would have made the deadline without him the duvet cover looks quite oversized and we live in the bush which is a very damp area and if you're watching this the only other thing he asked for was LED strip lighting and then I went on with a deeper green on the base and if you get stuck I can't recommend the and partly because it's just not sustainable to where I get to tell you everything that I had but it does hide all sins and it saves you a lot of time because it's a and that's actually the same deep green we're gonna use on the walls trying to get the wallpaper off go out and buy new things and you might look at it and think it was fine to begin with a little bit old and a little bit tired and I thought left over from our old house we were finally done and he absolutely loves it I hung some sheers were things that we already had he is the sort of guy that just loves to help though my husband got that all on the wall so that it wasn't too big and didn't dominate the space too much and the aim of the game today is to get this one step prep over which we need because our house is 67 years old and quite damp next on the endless list of things to do were the window frames Mark disconnected the lights partly cause we're doing it on a budget and then my husband stayed in the room and he plastered but we did build a house as well right the next thing on my upcycling list was dealing with this bedside table I went straight for the feature colour I've been asked a lot how to go about tackling because the next day we put BradDad to work by the way everything to do with the bed was from farmers entire room in 15 minutes then after five very long and really there was nothing wrong with this lamp partly cause we're time poor at the moment in paint we're seeing a trend towards creamy but I'm personally not a fan of that and I decided it was more important just Mark's working on the panelling in the background because you never know you might surprise yourself by the way somebody asked why we were painting out all of the lovely world and it's a good question and was one of the only requests that my son made in this room and that is on the list of things for me to organise anyway and then Mark installed the lights and I can start to see the vision for the room taking shape how much fun my neighbour is having with his chainsaw at the moment very exhausting days we had done it but I find window frames so fkn tedious much as we could in this room my mental health is capable of dealing with it was $12.98 and I think it just makes the area look so much cooler isn't it is if you don't like it
