pack with me for a little parents weekend getaway. we are only gone for like 24 hours and I can way too much stuff but so next time he's super cute I think I love this time and when you turn up so we are going for 24 hours like I just said and I've no idea what we're doing we're either going to have a 24 hour rot and do nothing but relax and watch TV and read books or like a pool or check out the beach downtown area who even knows so we're packing a little bit of everything packing my bathing suit cover up just in case we go to the pool or hit the beach one case the beach so that's probably not gonna happen but just in case you never know now for the outfit we need pair of pajamas these might be the only thing I wear if we decide to bedrock all weekend and I know my husband is from practice sweatshirt that man lights our room at 65 degrees and does not care if I'm freezing show me that and all different kinds of outfits because you never know what you're gonna feel like don't know what the weather is going to be like there's apparently a Hurricane making its way towards the Gulf so we could have really windy rainy weather or maybe sunny and how you do it so I got all the things just in case I'd wear dresses if it's really hot in here cause sometimes it's got a little bit of breeze and I'm obsessed with this two piece set it is so cute but but it is open and these are all tasty bras and when it is 100 degrees in here those things slide off so pack it because I like it might not get to wear that one and a two piece car ride set because girls gotta come to the car but I can't lounge and drive at the same time I don't want and there we go
