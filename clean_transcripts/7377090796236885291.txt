You are operating under the Assumption that when your kids grow up, they're gonna be like, oh, my god, you're right. Dad was so mean. And mom, you were the innocent one. We were all victims together to dad. So you're staying for the kids. What you don't realize is your kids could grow up and be like, mom, you got yourself in a fucking abusive relationship. Then you had some fucking kids and made us stick it out with you. You're on your fucking own.
