a few days ago I asked are there women out there who will refuse pregnancy to the extent they can if Trump wins in November this is the response I received these are women who refuse to do reproductive labor under a national abortion ban because they're fully aware that the maternal mortality rate is skyrocketing that in Texas alone it is up 56% after their abortion ban these are women who are justifiably afraid of becoming pregnant needing care and being unable to receive it being told that we have to wait until you get worse before we can help you we are unwilling to do reproductive labor for a government that is forcing us to do it a government that is still going to push these policies even though they know it will raise the maternal mortality rate if they're going to make us do this and they don't care that it could cost us our health and even our life then fine we won't do it and I see that I am not alone they are messing with the wrong people and we will damn sure see them at the ballot box
