hey friends let's make lunch together I think we can all agree that a stay at home moms we take care of everyone else but ourselves spent years surviving off of coffee and my kids leftovers after preparing serving and cleaning up meals for my kids there just is not enough time to feed myself before they need to something else I never really took my health seriously until recently when I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and I was forced to make some changes so let this be a reminder that fueling your body properly isn't self care it is a necessity okay so that chicken salad was good but I bit into something weird and I just could not finish that last bite does that ever happen to you and of course the trash is full I swear I have to take these things out every single day where is my husband this is a man's job I really hate that we have to keep our garbage cans in our garage with this Florida heat it smells like there is something dying in here I need some fresh air
