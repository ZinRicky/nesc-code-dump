if you're feeling kind of frustrated with the pool renovation and you're just hanging in there waiting for that final result can I just say same I miss life as I knew it but I'm pretty sure that this is the final update before *the* final update so settle in cause we've got a bit of ground to cover in previous updates we've dealt with some of the more aesthetic stuff like the tiling and the coping and I can't believe I'm actually saying it but the end is officially in sight but first we have to deal with you know the actual pool First order of business was to hit the surface with a really good cleaning and prep product to get rid of any residue and oh my goodness this process was more satisfying than my wedding night so this product is called True Prep and we purchased it from a brand name Cotec but can I just say that Grant and his team have been phenomenal a few weeks back they came out and did a site visit and recommended what products we would need they even sent across data sheets and technical specifications and tutorials to watch which you know naturally I forwarded to my husband and after a lot of phone calls and questions Cotec made us feel really confident that we knew what we were doing which is a bloody miracle we've also had another pool professional coming out and checking on our progress each week and I think I did mention that in part 1 but just to reiterate if you're insane like me and you're thinking of undertaking a project of this magnitude please reach out to your local network of experts side note but a lot of people have been concerned that my pools gonna crack or even pop up out of the ground and I'm not gonna lie - valid concern I've been worried about it too just to put your mind at rest before we started we did check that we have a hydrostatic valve which should hopefully make that not happen anyway if you remember in the previous update we were making holes in the bottom of the pool terrifying I know and now it's time to fix them and we're using another product from Cotec called Tuff Floor and this is your trigger warning okay cause apparently it's gotta look worse before it looks better I always tell myself when I'm doing projects like this so you gotta break a few eggs to make an omelette right but yeah it's gonna look pretty rough after but we've got to fix that pool cancer the way I understand it pool cancer is essentially where the plaster is cracking and pulling away from the actual concrete shell of the pool and that can be really problematic obviously cause you don't want chlorinated pool water getting down into that concrete shell or something And when the holes were filled our nephew came to lend a hand sanding cause she's a big job he must have heard that I'm only inviting helpers to the pool party but seriously the last six weeks have been so physically demanding Mark and I are exhausted and we were so grateful for the help the next step was to mix up a product called Trowel-It which was actually so fun the way that I think of this is it's like putting on a primer underneath your foundation you know what I mean so hopefully it's gonna make my poolâ€™s pores looks smaller so that her makeup fits nicer and last longer K so one question I've had a lot is what are we gonna do with the weird gap underneath the tiles where our previous tiles went down to we kinda had two options we could either hand cut thousands of tiles to fit in the gap which wasn't really an option if you ask me or we could fill it with this stuff before sanding and painting there was a question mark over a third option of maybe gouging out that gap to make it big enough to fit a full tile but we're advised that maybe it wasn't the best option and also I'm running out of fks to give so I'm just gonna take these easy road so we're gonna fill that gap and also cover up all of the worst spots in the pool which turns out to be most of it including literally all of the spa I don't know why but the spa I was so rough there were literally gouges taken out of the wall anyway so when the pool man came back he told us that we might have gone a bit overboard with that step but I don't actually mind cause guess what? it's the last thing we need to do before we paint okay I lied we have to sand everything again then we paint and I'm posting in real time so I'm so sorry but I promise the next updates gonna be a goodie
