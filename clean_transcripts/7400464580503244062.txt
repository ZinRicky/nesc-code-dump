Wednesdays are gonna be our co op days and it doesn't start until next so rather than do a full day of learning I stuck with what we will be doing on a typical Wednesday which is a read aloud and wonder book so basically they had a really easy day today probably the first year that both kids participate in co op because Maverick is finally old enough so what I've Learned from the last two years is they will come back absolutely exhausted it's four hours of learning outdoors on a farm and it's so much fun but it is also Florida and 100 degrees outside and they are last year I just counted farm school as the whole school day it was also Thursday and we had such a hard time getting back into a routine for Friday because farm schools on a Wednesday this year I feel we have to do a little bit of school after work to keep the momentum going to finish out the week strong I feel like wonder booking and then real out our little sprinkle of school work without the stress how do you handle co op days in your homeschooling
