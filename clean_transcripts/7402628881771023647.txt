come with us to the Jurassic Quest experience this past weekend at the Charleston Area Convention Center the Jurassic Quest Dinosaur Experience came and it was a fabulous time it's a traveling expo featuring life size dinosaurs and interactive experiences most of the families there had children from ages 2 to 5 but my big kids who were 8 9 I think had the best time of all with bouncy houses ride on dinosaurs and live interactive experiences with real life dinosaurs this was fun for all of us
