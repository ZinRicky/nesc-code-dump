Modern day trad wife here Victoria Lit If you wanna look classy put together, feminine and have or attract a man To take care of you, to love you, to treat you nicely then you have to be in your feminine energy You also have to dress the part You will feel better and overall look better This is just my suggestion you take it, leave it do whatever you want if you wanna be more feminine stop wearing things like sweats I get it they're comfortable But they're not the most feminine put them aside for a little bit Wear dress instead Stop wearing jeans with holes all over them Theyâ€™re not as classy Instead try buying jeans that don't have any holes in them (or skirts) I promise you you'll actually enjoy them lastly Birkenstocks are cute and everything But you gotta elevate yourself a little I know they're comfortable you don't have to throw them out you can still wear them However I will say that wearing a classy shoe/ sandal/ plain doesn't have rhinestones all over them is way more feminine and attractive If you want to look sporty put away the baggy t shirts instead wear something like a tennis skirt tennis dress and a cute top
