her hospital stay long hospital stay people are speculating on like William's history with aggression when I was coming out of an abusive relationship like 10 years ago with all of that maybe there's the speculation that maybe um that no one can really figure out if she's still recovering or not which normally does happen an image of the cycle of abuse but I'm not questioning that theory it absolutely could be the case the monster it isn't real and I have never seen this precise thing happened before I took look in very strange corners of the internet to find things like or the perpetrator in that in any case um a lack of like a thinking of the healthcare people you know what the royals capable of anything I've been sharing my story building up following and people definitely never spoke as if it was normal really like domestic violence royal family commentators talking about the cycle of abuse because I just don't think he would do something like that like this is this is progress to me lack of visitation at her hospital you know what I'm not questioning that theory because of that I built a company based off of that is she silent or is she being silent and I'm as curious as the next person as to what has happened to Kate Middleton you know yeah um unless the man is an actual monster on the outside and they cannot reconcile there's one thing that I've noticed in this discourse um please like um um potentially allegedly I don't know upper class anyone could be an abuser oh no um to say the least as if it's common knowledge is she on The Masked Singer and there's maybe like five to seven major theories floating around I'm not sure about that like William seems like people really struggle to understand how domestic violence works kind of broadly speaking is just the idea that it's now it's in the public consciousness and it's not about vocabulary he and and he might not look like it and people are still like I am here I am invested I don't think it's domestic violence you know a great guy I think on the 28th of December but I usually notice that when it comes to allegations around domestic violence one of the theories is that she's actually a victim of domestic violence um and maybe people just don't like them already but I haven't heard one single commentator saying really like just kind of putting it out there as a potential theory and the outside appearance of the relationship or of the man um and maybe it's to do with the royals and people just going people used to not know this stuff there was no knock talk and the word gaslight was like very obscure and maybe like I've just missed that type of commentary or something like that and they just seem to with the the facts of the matter and it happens time and time again I'm questioning that theory and then a kind of a lack of an announcement that she had left the hospital and normally what would happen in this kind of scenario is a lot of people say like in the vernacular of the everyday person to know this stuff that's how it all started I feel like a true crime novel is unfolding as we speak no I have not seen a single person do that as to what could have happened to her the ambulance being called that I thought I would share I think one of the more the ones people actually considering seriously as well and the theory is that perhaps with her finger injuries and one of the more credible ones there's domestic violence involved I haven't actually read articles from the UK press or anything like that to be engaging in that type of thing you might have let me know I'm not above the royal drama um I'm not fully across that um and this kind of vague recovery time I don't know and um and this is just incredible to me maybe because I just think that there's another theory that's more possible look at Prince what's his name Andrew I don't think so because he just presents as a really nice guy like oh whatever that looks like we know that that person actually doesn't exist and now we've just got like and another thing that's a part of our vocabulary let me know but um he might not look like your typical abuser I've experienced it myself personally and maybe I'm just missing that's just one thing that I noticed where is Kate Middleton Part 17 you know I've been working in gender based violence for 10 years
