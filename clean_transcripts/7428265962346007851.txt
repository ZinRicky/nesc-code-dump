I also have a 3 year old. This is now my third 3 year old. And god speed to anyone with a child aged 2 to 4, because holy shit. After my last round of raising toddlers nearly killed me, I started reading a couple books and I found out that the reason why people talk so much shit on teenagers is the same reason that they talk on toddlers. And it's actually for a very similar reason. They are going through a very similar brain developmental leap around that age where they are testing boundaries, they're pushing boundaries, they are asserting their individuality. I know we joke that we have three natures, but it's actually very similar. So although I don't have a teenager yet, I have a ten year old, she's about to be 10. So we're about to crest into this phase. I am certain that it's going to feel a lot like a more dangerous, more independent three major phase. But I think if I hold on to the fact that it is a developmental leap, a developmental brain stage very much like toddlerhood, I think I'll be able to emotionally handle it better. At least. Here's hoping.
