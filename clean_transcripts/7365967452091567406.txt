little Pep talk with my husband this week because he is a selfless person he is a giver to a fault but both of us are in the weeds right now with both our toddler our other kids homeschooling work etcetera we've just got a lot on our plate and we're both starting to burn out and I Learned a long time ago through being a stay at home mom how to prioritize self care and me time in order to not lose my ever loving mind he hasn't yet found a way to ask for what he needs or even really conceptualize what he needs he has this golden boy mentality that his job is always to be taking care of somebody else so I had to explain to him that I don't want him to be selfless I would rather him be in a better mood and in a better headspace then be around all the time this is probably universally true because if you truly love someone you want them to be their best self and the best version of self isn't selfless cause no one's their best self if they're overworked and resentful it's not always about how often you show up and this goes for all parents with their kids too it's what version of you is showing up who's showing up that is so much more impactful and although my husband feels like being around as much as humanly possible and taking no time for himself is helping me the real help would be taking time for himself so he could show up as the best version of himself and I take that philosophy into my mothering as well mom is not her best self if she's selfless
