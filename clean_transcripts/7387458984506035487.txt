just because someone's a dad and even a girl dad does not make them a good person it doesn't make them a safe person it doesn't make them worthy of dating this is the b t k serial with his daughter look at him on a Christmas morning so Kylie and giving her a gift he was a serial but he's also a dad many things can be true at once you can be evil horrific horrible and be a parent even a broken clock is right twice a day so that guy that's treating you like shit and you're hoping oh maybe things will change maybe they won't maybe they won't maybe he is just a rotten crazy piece of shit and you're staying for no fuck you're you're staying cause you're fucking delusional and you need to wake up so just because someone is a dad a girl dad kinda nice has a job doesn't mean they're not potentially fucking psychotic
