Why? You should never, ever, ever beg someone to stay. Because with the right person, your existence will be enough. You don't have to beg for affection, respect and validation. If you find the right person, they will give that to you freely. I guarantee you. If you let go of the person who does not serve you and your life, you're opening up space for the person who will. So stop. Stop begging for someone to stay in your life. Dad. Kick the door wide open for them. Let them leave.
