We're about to make the best roasted tomato soup with cheesy garlic bread. There's just nothing that beats that combination. So we're gonna start off by making some baguette. So I add my starter with all of my ingredients to my bowl and then give it a good knead in my stand mixer. When the dough is really sticky, I transfer it to a greased bowl just to rise for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, I do stretch and folds, and then let it rest for another 45 minutes before I form my dough into three little balls. I then fold them over and form them into little logs before I put them aside for their final rise. In the meantime, I prep my tomato soup. So I get all of my tomatoes. I use a few different ones. I use heirloom tomatoes, some cherry tomatoes, and then tomatoes on the vine. I also had some purple carrots laying around, so I decided to add those as well. We can't forget about the onions and the garlic. And I sprinkle it with some olive oil, salt, pepper, and some Rosemary. While that's roasting in the oven, I get started on making my butter. Once my butter is separated from my buttermilk, I squeezed out all the liquid and then rinsed it in cold water, sliced it up, and put that aside. Then I swapped out my tomatoes in the oven for my baguette. And while those were baking, I blended Up my tomato soup and had to run it through a strainer just to get all the little bits out. And then I added some miso paste. Love the combination of miso and tomato. Then I took the roasted garlic, squeezed it out, added it to my butter alongside some parsley and flaky sea salt, and spread that all over our fresh baguettes, topped it with a good amount of cheese, and there we go. I was so excited to have this. There's nothing more comforting to me than cheesy garlic bread with tomato.
