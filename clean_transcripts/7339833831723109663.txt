so I just watched a video of Aaron Bushnell who was 25 years old and in the Air Force and he just in the ultimate act of protest for Palestine and against what's happening in Israel and United States complicit actions he self emulated in front of the Israeli embassy in Washington DC and I just can't stop thinking about how we are so corrupt as a country that this is the second self emulation that I know of in recent years protesting the last one was for the climate crisis which were all one day or other gonna succumb to but this man described as like one of the most principal people by his peers sacrificed his life he stood there saying he would no longer be complicit to the genocide that's happening right now in Palestine and it just how can something like that happen and it not even be front page news how how how can something so severe happen and then just people just don't care like how how do our leaders not care I we live in such a morally corrupt country and I genuinely I'm at such a utter loss for word but I will forever remember this video along with everything else that we've seen from Palestine like that's just I his last words were free Palestine and I truly pray that we get to see a free Palestine in our lifetimes
