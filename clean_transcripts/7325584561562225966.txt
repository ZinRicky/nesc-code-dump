Idaho Senator Chuck Winder suggests that abortion is to blame for Idaho's work shortages we complain about we don't have service workers we don't have enough of this we don't have enough people to do this well I think there's a reason not it's not just low birth rate but it is the number of abortions that have occurred before diving into how absurd of a statement that is let's be clear that even if abortions were causing a worker shortage women do not owe anyone including their government their bodies or reproductive labor forced birth is not a policy solution to Idaho's problems which I'll get to in a second Idaho's abortion rate has been quite low in stagnant since the early 2000s with about 1000 to 1500 abortions being performed each year and just last week the US Chamber of Commerce released new data Idaho has about 55,000 job openings and about 28,000 unemployed individuals so obviously the math isn't mathing but even if it was his statement has a bunch of just incorrect logical fallacies he's assuming that if we forced all of these women to have given birth that they all would have resulted in a healthy pregnancy a healthy baby that would turn into a healthy adult that would choose to stay and work in Idaho and he makes one of the most common Republican logical fallacies which is that if we just forced all of these women who have historically had abortions to have given birth that we would have a net increase in population no research shows that let's say we have two women we have Sam and Sarah and they both want an abortion Sam is denied an abortion but Sarah receives the wanted abortion Sam is much less likely to have planned planned pregnancies later on in her life versus Sarah who is much more likely to have planned pregnancies later on in her life so Sam may end up having one child while despite having the abortion Sarah ends up having three to the extent that Idaho is experiencing a lower than typical birth rate let's just appreciate how dangerous it is to be pregnant in Idaho from 2019 to 2021 the maternal mortality rate in Idaho rose 121% while the child an infant mortality rate rose 18% then Idaho Republicans enacted one of the country's strictest abortion bans and being aware of research that shows that that will increase maternal mortality guess what they did they dissolved the committee who is tasked with investigating maternal mortality maternal services like prenatal care and Obgyns are becoming much and much more scarce in the state as Obgyns and other doctors flee because of the strict abortion ban one in five Idaho moms do not receive any prenatal care in the first trimester and that number is even lower for women of color and three in 10 Idaho moms did not have health insurance before becoming pregnant 2023 Idaho Republicans rejected $6 million in free federal funding to support child care and early childhood development because they and this is a quote didn't wanna make it more convenient for mothers to leave the home it infuriates me that these men are in power men who don't understand us see us value us or our lives who feel entitled to our bodies and reproductive organs and decisions who blame us for the consequences of their bad policy making it's a level of entitlement and cruelty and willful ignorance that I don't know that I will ever be able to understand I'm the feminist lawyer follow me if you enjoy being miserable
