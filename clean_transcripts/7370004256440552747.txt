Iâ€™ve reported numerous times on how conservatives next avenue for curtailing women's freedoms is targeting divorce they wanna make it harder to get a divorce see we use a no fault divorce system meaning that you can just get a divorce for irreconcilable differences but we used to use a fault based system meaning that you would have to prove infidelity or some type of abuse in order to obtain a divorce you can watch my previous videos on why this is such bad public policy to go back to a fault based divorce system but I think a lot of it's quite obvious and every time I talk about this I am flooded with comments by men basically saying well if you can't prove that he committed wrongdoing why should you get to leave let's be clear at the outset. you are not entitled to anyone no one is your property any reason to leave someone is a good reason they are no longer consenting to the relationship I also never stop being shocked by how many men are delusional enough to believe that women are genuinely leaving them for no reason no reason it's a completely happy marriage they're leaving them for no reason this is all a level of predatory that I can't even fathom but it typically gets worse I'm then flooded with a lot of well she shouldn't get to take half his stuff she should walk with nothing this demonstrates to me as a lawyer that you don't understand both the facts on the ground and how family law works first of all women are significantly contributing to marriages whether they're in the home or out of the home today there we have a lot of dual income households a lot of women are increasingly the breadwinners in marriages I've worked on several divorces where a couple gets divorced and the woman has to pay monthly alimony to the man because she was the breadwinner in the family they're bringing assets property generational wealth all of these things the wealth and the assets in your family are not the man's all of this in an era where these same conservative men are decrying that a woman's place is in the household but the highest honor and biggest contribution you can be is a wife mother and homemaker want women to be completely financially dependent on men to stop developing their career and their skill set because they say that staying home is the highest honor in such a contribution to the household but if she leaves you've suddenly not in their view contributed to the household or the household's wealth and property again I can't fathom being this big of a predator like what you want is a servant who is financially dependent on you and as a practical matter cannot leave this is another common one I get um from men saying well it's a contract there's consequences for breaking it um terminating a contract is not the same as breaching that contract so no that's not how contracts work you can absolutely rescind and terminate contracts I'm a lawyer this is contract law 101 one last but certainly not least is I get flooded with we'll just don't get married um again can't wrap my head around this train of thought um you your stance on this is either get married and be willing to be trapped with me forever non consensually or you can't get married at all I'm the feminist lawyer I'm a litigator with a background and gender policy and reproductive rights take a little jaunt through my comments if you enjoy being miserable
