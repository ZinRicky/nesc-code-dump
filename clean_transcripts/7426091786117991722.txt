so wicked the musical the movie is coming out in November and I could not be more excited for any of you who remember I took my daughter and my son and my husband he came with uh to New York last year for my daughter's ninth birthday to see wicked because she is a massive wicked fan and a huge Idina Mendel fan I grew up in suburbs of New York going to Broadway with my parents we were very blessed to be able to go see some of these incredible actors and actresses whenever we wanted and I feel so lucky that I get to share this interest with my daughter who is now doing musical theatre as her like special interest but she also loves watching like the old school Disney Channel shows I know they're problematic with the backstory but she loves Captain Sam she loves music she loves singing so she loves Ariana Grande and I realize there's a really big reason why a lot of us original theatre geeks are kind of upset with the Ariana Grande casting stay with me for a second because I don't think it has anything to do with her talent or her pop star status I think it's because true theatre geeks and theatre fans look at the theatre as a place for the outcasts you know the LGBTQ the neurodivergent the weird kids and we look at Ariana like she's a popular girl she is a pop star and we've already seen this happen with The Greatest Showman and Jeremy Jordan getting passed up for Zac Efron which again Zac Efron did a great job but he's no Jeremy Jordan we slightly wanna see these roles being taken by people in the Broadway community the outcasts the theatre kids now I'm not a massive Ariana Grande fan I just have never really been into her style of music but she is a theatre kid masquerading and presenting herself like a pop star cool girl princess she is not that person deep down and you can kind of tell with how she presents herself that she has been marketed by copying other people's style and presentation because it's cool because it's trendy and she's got a lot of flack for that but I think that has been manufactured for her I think deep down and again I do not have a parasocial relationship with Ariana Grande I just have watched her gush over Broadway musicals and participate in Broadway so much that I think she is a nerd who happens to be hot and I think she's gonna do a really wonderful job with the role because you can tell that she cares about these characters as much as the rest of us do and I personally cannot wait to go see it
