it pains me to admit that I'm still renovating my kitchen and I always say you can't renovate without making a mess literally everywhere else so today I'm tackling some very dirty and very overdue job starting with my fridge so I'm going in with the JIF Cleanboost Cream Cleanser in the new scent Lily Flower the Cleanboost range is more demure made with naturally derived cleaning ingredients and a biodegradable fragrance onto the veggie bins and I'm dealing with what looks like it would have been a great starter culture for my compost I do love compost just not in my fridge and this one looks like it was moments away from becoming sentient if I thought the fridge was bad the bins were so much worse I used some more JIF to scrub the inside and the outside within an inch of its life which did wonders for my mental health and even though it's designed to be safer for people and the planet you still get that really powerful JIF clean with no residue left behind with the bins reset and smelling fresh it was time to turn my attention back to my poor sink which has just taken an absolute beating this entire time I gave her a good scrub while whispering my apologies for the trauma that I've just put her through and just like that the holy trinity of domestic bliss aka the fridge bins and sink are done
