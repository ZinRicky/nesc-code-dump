I have a love hate relationship with my open shelving. I feel like sometimes I'm like, this is the best thing ever. And then when I'm messy and things get cluttered, it gets overwhelming. So our word for 2024 is simplify. Jake and I really wanna simplify our lives. And for me, today, that looks like decluttering my open shelving and trying to get everything in its proper place. We've already done this to the kitchen, and it feels so good to just simplify our lives. Less really is more. My plan is to do this to the entire house. And I'm not even gonna lie, it's a pretty good start. This made me feel so good and accomplished.
