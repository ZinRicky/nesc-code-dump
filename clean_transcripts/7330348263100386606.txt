who is your unconventional celebrity crush if I see I have three male unconventional celebrity crushes to be fair I don't have a lot of conventional celebrity crushes I don't know what that says about me okay number one my all time stud forever crush Paul Rudd okay I have four um number one Paul Run number two Stanley Tucci the girls who get it get it okay we're not even gonna go into it Peter Dinklage he has such big dick energy you cannot argue that number four is John Favreau and that's the one when I tell people that's the one that I usually get the the most really about but it started when he was Pete the boxer on friends and it's really just grown from there but yeah I think I actually drunkenly DM John Favreau once and told him um I would do dirty things to him but
