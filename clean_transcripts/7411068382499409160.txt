we've had our UPS and downs Chloe thank you thank you thank you Chloe goes on to say that it's a red flag now this isn't her normal type of content but I really applaud it um because I think it's really really important for people to be thinking like this and not that it always is a red flag and not that it always means something suspicious is happening or something dubious is going on in the relationship but just that people need to have a lens um of understanding that abusive relationships are living and breathing amongst us the monster myth is real it is a myth it is there um to ensure that men can keep getting away with abuse and look and live and breathe like normal decent human beings um all while perpetrating in plain sight we all get told that marriage is really hard work and that we have to make compromises and sacrifices and women especially get told this is falls into the category of gendered advice and at this point I think we always need to be asking is propaganda because we have a lot of gender propaganda lies myths mistruths that have been told to us as we grow up from the stage of being little girls um that really set us up and condition us for a life of domestic servitude to men intergenerational propaganda is absolutely essential to ensuring that any power source can continue to perpetrate abuse um any oppressor continue can continue to oppress now we live in a patriarchy it's intergenerational we've lived in one for quite a long time now um in order for a patriarchy to survive just like in order for an oligarchy to survive in order for a dictatorship to survive um in order for a monarchy to survive we need propaganda and brainwashing so I'm here to debunk a lot of the brainwashing just make people rethink a few things not casting judgement on people definitely not definitely not um tryna make people's lives harder just asking people to stay curious and to check in on themselves and each other um stay safe out there girls love you
