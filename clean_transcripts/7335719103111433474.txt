we had 72 hours to completely transform our patio which technically we would call a deck here in Aotearoa New Zealand but I know what I sound like and I don't wanna bang on about how hard it was to give this big beautiful deck a makeover under the beating hot sun so we're just gonna go with patio how good did this railing come up with just a bit of spray paint though anyway so day 1 and 2 didn't feel all that productive if I'm honest day one we were hit with gale force winds and rain and day 2 we were hit with the shocking realisation that neither one of us is actually very smart it was this pattern though this pattern has a lot to answer for and I know it doesn't look like there's a pattern but apparently there is anyway it wasn't until my husband lugged 500 kgs of tiles that's about 1100 pounds for my American friends onto the property that I realised perhaps would have been easier if we went with like a standard 600 by 600 tile that's not really our style cause apparently we enjoyed making this deck significantly harder than it needed to be I mean patio we made the patio more difficult just to be clear but I think I saw these tiles at Tile Space like six months ago and it was legitimately love at first sight they took my breath away and I knew that I needed to use them somewhere in a project there's just something about them that's giving “lived in” and that's really the ethos that I have for this house I'm not sure if you've been following along with any of our other renovation projects but we moved from a new build into this house about seven or eight months ago and she's a 67 year old mid century diamond in the rough and we're on a mission to slowly restore her to her former glory by choosing finishes that feel like they've always been here in part 1 I ran out of time to tell you exactly why we have a deadline despite the fact that I set an intention to not rush through my projects again this year and I don't know if I'm just that particular flavour of crazy that attracts a hectic deadline but also I do love a deadline cause it really makes you get shit done do you know what I mean and consider this my behind the scenes confessional because I'm not sure if you noticed but we didn't actually get the patio done but we got it done enough for me to do what I needed to do next which was the reason I had the deadline so I was approached by my friends at Freedom Furniture and the Kiwi Kids Charity and they asked me if I'd be keen to photograph this beautiful outdoor table setting because they're auctioning off a larger version for charity the Kiwi Kids Charity does really impactful work for children In Aotearoa and I love the alignment with Freedom so it was an immediate yes from me but then I remembered what my patio look like and really I couldn't photograph such a beautiful piece of furniture on my gross old sixty year old deck I mean patio so essentially I built a set and hopefully one that would honour the quality of this furniture and encourage people to go bid and raise money for children in need in our community so now if you ever see any of those photos you’ll know it's reality versus social media half of the pavers aren't stuck down we didn't even start grouting and we definitely didn't finish the project in 72 hours but we did what we needed to do before moving it all out again and continuing to stick down these pavers which might take a week
