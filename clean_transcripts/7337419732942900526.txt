These are some things I prep to make my week just a little bit easier. I started off by making a blueberry lemon loaf. So I took some Greek yoghurt zest in my lemon, added some honey as my sweetener, some eggs to my liquid batter, and then added that to my dry batter. Give it a good mix, added some blueberries, and pop that in the oven. Once that was done, I let that cool while I started on my pickles. I was doing different pickles. I was doing a classic cucumber pickle with some garlic, bay leaves, dill, and then I also decided to just do my classic pickled onion that I do almost every week. I top that with some peppercorn and then my vinegar mixture, close my jar UPS and set those aside while I started on my granola bars. My kids are obsessed with these. I combine some honey with peanut butter and then add my oats and whatever toppings you like. I opted for white chocolate chips, some dried cranberries, some chia seeds, and flax seeds. I put those in the fridge for about an hour before slicing them up, and then I got started on my salad for the week. This week I wanted to go for something that is super filling but stores well, so I did some quinoa, kale, carrots, some feta, some cucumber, and top that with a miso lemon dressing. I like prepping one hot meal a week. Just Because I don't like eating the same meals over and over again, so I just do one hot meal, which this week was yaki udon. So we had some wagyu lying around. I added that to the pan, gave that a saute, pulled that out, and then sauteed all of my vegetables. Once those were done, I added my noodles and my sauce, gave that really good mix, and it was done. I like storing all of my food in glass containers if I can. So I put my granola bars back in the fridge, packed away my salad, and then moved on to my noodles. I didn't put the lid on because they were still pretty hot. And this wraps up my meal prep.
