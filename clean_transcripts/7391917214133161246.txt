I tried to film a get ready with me while I was like talking to the camera I couldn't concentrate I didn't know what I was putting on my face and trying to say at the same time does anybody else have that problem or is it just me anywho last week I chatted a little about how I became a homeschool mom but I wanted to talk a little about what I did in between I had my oldest daughter in my third year of teaching at the beginning of the school year I had her in August and then I took six weeks of Matern leave which not enough and then I went back and finish out the school year so that entire year the first year of her life I was a working mom and if you know anything about being a teacher it is not a 40 hour week job you are doing after school stuff you are doing things on the weekends prepping planning all things I was so miserable so at the end of the year I quit and I was just a stay at home mom until I had my second and they are two years apart and then when my son was like four months old I started teaching from home and I taught English to students in China so my hours were awful but we were just in this place financially where we just could not get ahead we were living paycheck to paycheck my husband was working a hundred plus hours and it just didn't feel good so I start working from home I did that for two years and we changed our lifestyle moved into an RV and that I became just a stay home mom again and then when my daughter was in pre K her teacher went on maternity leave and I said for her and then I became a preschool teacher for two years until my daughter started so over the years I have been a working mom I have been a stay at home mom a work from home mom and now homeschool mom and I can honestly say from all of those experiences this is by far the most taxing and the hardest thing I have ever done in my life but also the most rewarding
