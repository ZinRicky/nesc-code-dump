One thing that I wish I Learned sooner is that drinking is such a waste of time, energy, money Maturing is realizing that not everyone can go out and drink without trying to ruin their life. I'm someone who when I have a sip of alcohol I turn into a different person she's fun all right but she's chaotic and messy we had to say bye to her maybe you're a person who can enjoy one drink and you're fine you're not hungover but me.. (YIKES) I imagine I'm not alone in this I wasted so much of my youth on drinking and partying for what? life got so much better and more refreshing ever since I quit drinking
