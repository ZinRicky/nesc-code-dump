The notion that children are somehow a burden what are they interfering with? what have you got to do that's so important? what? you're gonna drink 2,000 less 26â€™s of vodka with your idiot friends at the bar? that's your that's your brilliant alternative to growing up? and you know I I do believe it's very hard for people to grow up if they don't have children and people hate it when I say that because there are other ways of growing up but it's very hard and the reason it's hard is because you are not mature until someone else clearly matters more than you do and if you aren't narcissistic beyond redemption that definitely happens to you when you have children and then you're an adult you know even if you're not that good at it as long as that other person is now something you would die for and really or something that you would live for
