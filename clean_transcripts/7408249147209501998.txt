my sourdough starters have been in the back of my fridge for several months so let's see if we can rehydrate them that dark stuff on top is not mold it's actually called hooch and it has been in my fridge for so long but it's all kind of hardened and then I spilt water all over myself which is really nice but this project was really interesting I decided to take two different starters that I had in the back of my fridge and rehydrate them both just as a little experiment to see how long it takes to get them back and going I know that it's gonna take several feedings before they are ready to use because it's in the back of my fridge for so long it just took a little timber love and care I used warm water and my Italian flour to restart them so I guess we'll check in and after a few feedings and see where we're at
