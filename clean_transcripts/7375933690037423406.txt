One thing about me is I love to gather As a woman , I think it's built into my DNA I love gathering I love grocery shopping I love going to Trader Joe's just to get flowers I love it so much I love going to Costco I'm going there right now and I'm so excited! I love getting things for my house Feels so rewarding to gather If you're a woman and you love to gather or if you're a man and you don't love to gather Let the wife do it because we’ll probably love it We’d love if you would join us in our gathering but we understand you're out there hunting working your job leave the gathering to us we will make your house into a home
