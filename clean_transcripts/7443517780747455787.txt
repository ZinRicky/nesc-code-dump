Having a hobby will give you depth to yourself and stimulate your brain. Golf. Am I good at it? No, but it's fun and you get to wear cute little outfit. Another option hiking. I used to live in Washington, so hike all the time. I'm in Texas now, so there's not that many hikes, but if you like being outdoors, try going on a hike, cooking a new recipe, or baking. I have always been a person who loves cooking, so if you want to get into cooking, this is a really good hobby. Reading. I love reading. Anything from Colleen Hoover is literally magic to my brain. Also painting, arts or crafts. I love anything that I can be creative in. This is, like, really where I got my happiest, when I can do my crafts. You might laugh and say this isn't a hobby, but I think getting coffee at a new cafe or place is a hobby. Along with trying a new restaurant. That is a hobby. Okay, understand that you're probably not depressed. You just need something to stimulate your brain.
