As a German, there would always be Nutella in our house, and every time it would run low, a new jar would magically appear. So today I decided to introduce my husband to the concept of Nutella and crepes. I started by roasting my hazelnuts in the oven for about 10 minutes, letting them cool slightly before rubbing them to get all the skin off. I then transferred them over to my food processor and let that go until they turned into a very shiny paste. This point I added in my melted chocolate, some cocoa powder, vanilla, a pinch of salt, and some powdered sugar, turn my food processor back on and let that go while drizzling in some neutral oil. Once that all came together, I put it aside, let it cool slightly, and that was our homemade Nutella. I moved on to making my crepe batter by adding some eggs, milk, water, vanilla, a pinch of salt, whisking that while I gradually added in some flour, making sure that there's no clumps, and also some melted butter. I heated up my pan and my batter in before spreading it as thin as I could. Once my crepes were golden brown, I folded them up and drizzled them with some of my homemade Nutella. When my husband tried them, he was shocked at how good they were.
