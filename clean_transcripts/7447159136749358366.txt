homeschooling is hard all the time but it is really hard homeschooling during the holidays not only is it really busy but it's also a very over stimulating season all the festivities the music the lights the decor it's all really great things but it can be overwhelmed and this affects you and your kids you are probably concerned about your overwhelming to do list and they're consumed about all the fun and exciting things going on so if homeschooling isn't going as well as you hoped give yourself Grace you can start fresh in January
