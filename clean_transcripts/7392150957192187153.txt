men will say like oh you're dressing for me you're dressing for the male gaze if you didn't want attention why'd you dress like that and like they will truly believe that with their whole little hearts but the thing is it's kind of true like I do I do I do take it into account but not in the way you think like I will not wear makeup for men I will not wear a crop top for men I will not shave my legs for men because I wanna send a clear message that I do not wanna be mess with today I do not have the time today I don't wanna be perceived by men today I don't have the energy and some days I do have the energy to just put up with it but most days I don't and I will find myself dressing sluttier than anything if I am going to a safe queer space or a safe female dominated like the girls the gays the gays space that's when I will be my skankiest so in a six side way they're kinda right but also just like so so wrong there is truly no greater compliment than a gay man saying that you're hot like I will truly not consider a compliment a compliment from a straight man it goes over my head but if a gay man there is nothing better in this world than a gay man or a girl saying that you're pretty I still have a catalog of all the compliments in my head that I've ever received from gay men I could list them out now to you I won't but I I I could but I could not tell you a single compliment that I've gotten from a straight man in fact I could list off some nagging cause that lives rent free in my head but not a single compliment it just not cause I haven't gotten one but because obviously but because they don't mean anything they don't stick
