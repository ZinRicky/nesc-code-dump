Today we're doing a lot of baby prep, so I wanted to wear something really comfy. My go to sweatpants have been these Aritzia Sweat Fleece Sweatpants. I'm 6 foot tall, so I like that they come in two different lengths. I couldn't decide which top to wear, but I decided to do the matching top since it was so comfortable.
