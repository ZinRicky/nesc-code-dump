It's everything Halar is known for, the amazing waffle fabric. It's flowy, it's stretchy, and it's at the. The V neck cut and the little short sleeves really gives you that smaller appearance up top. And then the waistband and then the wide, flowy legs. This is, like, so flattering on your body. I especially love if it.
