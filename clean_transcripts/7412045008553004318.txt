do you see that puff of powder come off that line yeah that thing was beyond moldy anyway today was a family juice day in case you're new around here hey we are the Hawleys and we do not buy store bought juices not because we're too good for them but because we just prefer the taste of fresh juice my kids are bougie a f and they will not drink a store bought juice especially orange juice but I don't blame them because it does taste so much better for us so usually once or twice a week I'm making fresh orange juice so lately my husband has been wanting fresh lime juice for his sparkling waters have you figured out where my kids get their bougieness from so today he decided to help with the juicing and he decided to place an Instacart order for Costco at 9:00am and he got nothing but fruit this is why you can't trust men with your Instacart order we ended up with orange juice and pineapple juice which taste really good together by the way half a picture of apple juice which I will not be drinking for some reason I have never liked apple juice and we finished with the combo juice of orange Tangerine and strawberry which is my absolute favourite so for $100 and two hours of my time we have two pictures of juice and a squeezy bottle of wine a very sticky kitchen and even more happy children but an also happy husband cause this was his idea and now it's his mess to clean up bye
