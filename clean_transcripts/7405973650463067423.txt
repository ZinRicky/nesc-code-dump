and I am Palestinian but I do put myself as American first I really do because I mean at the end of the day I was born and raised here and I wanna defend the land that I love from anything that's that could possibly threaten it and I really do view our government as threatening it it's very sad a lot of my family has been killed a lot of um my friends have been killed think about what you would want people to do if someone was bombing your children definitely the arms embargo as well as call for that permanent ceasefire and like a true arms embargo that's exactly what that's that's what I'm trying to have in life that's all what are you trying to have just peace and prosperity and everybody just to actually value each other
