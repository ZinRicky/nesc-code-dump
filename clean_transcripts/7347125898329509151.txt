guys did you know that if you return clothes you don't like you get money back that's crazy I literally had like four things in a bag for maybe six months um just sitting there and I just got back 130 bucks I already paid it like several pay periods ago so basically I just made 130 bucks I (think) target specifically allows you to return anything that you've gotten within a year pretty sure like no questions asked so anyway I know I'm probably the first person to tell you about this but like definitely definitely consider doing it
