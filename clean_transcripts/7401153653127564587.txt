so I've been watching this whole school supply debate happen on TikTok and as somebody who homeschools I don't really have skin in the game this year but we were traditionally schooling family for a couple years and I was shocked at how many school supplies you have to get and we also did the communal bin for the classroom of school supplies and we're actually doing a co op this year for a homeschool and it's the same thing everybody's gonna bring like bulk of one or two different supplies but it's pretty much works the same way we're all gonna be sharing the same supplies now firstly this is in order to make sure that every child has the same access to the same supplies not every kid every family is gonna be able to put the Bill for all of the supplies as somebody who has the financial privilege of being able to buy whatever my children need um I have no problem with this and I know buying school supplies is expensive and that it may be a struggle for some people but if you do run out as a classroom they will fundraise for that later or take donations the whole point is that no child including your child is gonna go without what they need now people saying that it's on the teacher in order to buy all the school supplies obviously don't understand how little teachers are paid and how much they already do pay out of their own pockets to fund the decoration and a lot of the extras in the classroom that make learning fun this is also just a really great way of teaching kids community you know looking out for each other providing for your less fortunate classmates I think the fact that there's like a debate about it at all is really sad although I can understand because I know people are struggling right now but I feel like it's in those times that we need to remind our children that we are a community and we are gonna get through everything together and Our Department of education needs better funding the school should be providing the school supplies really and be paying the teachers more
