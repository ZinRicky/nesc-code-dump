I got a few comments like this so let's talk about jury selection yes all jurors come with personal experiences and personal beliefs and backgrounds that may affect how they view a case and apply the law however civil and criminal litigans have a constitutional right to an impartial jury do we use a lot of different tools and litigation including jury selection to try to do everything we can to meet that end goal if a court has a reasonable basis to believe that a jurors beliefs or experiences may prevent or substantially impair their ability to render impartial justice they may strike that juror and this happens all the time the important thing to understand here is that the court is not saying that you cannot hear a case and apply the law what the court is saying is that these particular jurors said things in the jury selection process that in relation to the facts of this particular case creates a risk that they may not be able to render justice impartially so in this case these jurors made more than one comment about their strong views on homosexuality and because the plaintiff in this case is a lesbian whose claim is centered on the fact that she is a lesbian it would obviously be better if we had a jury that is neutral on the topic of homosexuality Justice Alito's argument that this is religious discrimination is very un persuasive to me because there are Christians who are themselves homosexuals there are Christian allies and there are also non religious people who would have been struck for saying I have strong views on homosexuality either way these jurors were clearly struck for their strong beliefs on homosexuality irrespective of their religion let me know what you think in the comments
