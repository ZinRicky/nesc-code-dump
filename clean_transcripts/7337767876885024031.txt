I am well aware I am someone who takes this medication because I need it for my health I'm not sure if people my comments are like willfully obtuse think they're actually being helpful or they just suck but obviously I was not talking about people taking this medication who need it I am someone who needs medication I have not been able to get my medication in two months because people are using it for weight loss I think it's amazing and I think it's great for them there are million ways to lose weight why not do it through something that isn't as boring as working out people hate on it because they wanna do it and the people who hate on the most the people who are secretly doing it or pissed off that they can't afford it people like that that is the issue because not only are you taking the drug that you don't need talking about this medication so frivolously without actually understanding the consequence of what they're talking about or the medication they're taking dismissing legitimate concern as people being jealous and contributing to an overall societal idea of anti fatness those are the people that I'm having an issue with that's what I'm talking about
