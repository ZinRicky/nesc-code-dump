one thing about me is I'm gonna bring up fat fashion at a fashion week event because two thirds of the United States women are plus size so if you're a fashion brand what are you doing if not making clothes for plus size people you can compliment me you can say that my jacket looks cool that I look cool that I belong in this room and if you can think that about me then all fat people should also be included
