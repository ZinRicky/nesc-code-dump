such a great example of something that I feel like we don't talk enough about which is that emotional intelligence there's such an emphasis I think um for men to like express their emotions and obviously that's happening in this video but what's also happening in this video is men listening to emotions and to other men's emotions and creating not just creating space for them but not being afraid of them um and again there's so much emphasis on on saying the right thing and um I think that creates a lot of fears for a lot of men of like not being able to know what to say but like what's so great about this video is that Travis Kelce doesn't say much but in not saying much he says everything he's basically saying this is okay you're allowed to cry all of these emotions are valid and I'm strong enough to hold space for them he's not making a joke or trying to move things along he's holding space for another man's emotion and it's pretty beautiful
