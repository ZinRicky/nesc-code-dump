so I've been sharing a lot of resources lately about how to handle big feelings in my kids books we've been reading tools we've been using but I just came across a book and I think it is the perfect book I wish I read it as a child my older kids are starting to have like friendships and click situations um so this is the book it's called the not so friendly friend and it's perfect for kids learning how to navigate boundaries with other people but honestly for those of us who like it's also like one of those cute little rhiny sing songy books so it's it's a little juvenile for my nine and eight year old but it really gets the point across um I wish I'd had this when I was a kid because this goes also for like family members it would be really good resource for talking about why we don't talk to grandma or Aunt Karen anymore if you wanna be kind I'd be glad if you'd play but if you don't treat me right you can go on your way and then at the back it has all these conversations starts about boundaries
