I wanna talk about this kind of gendered cycle of people pleasing in regards to Taylor Swift I don't know what it's called I've just been thinking about it it's just occurred to me and I've realised something I'm Doctor Zoe I have a PhD in digital feminist activism and I like to make accessible content for people to further their feminist identities so Taylor Swift has made everyone feel very uncomfortable and ill at ease I think we all knew she was just getting so high and almost just like half wondering she'll fall really far and half wondering if she's just untouchable at this point she's a billionaire so in many way she is untouchable but in terms of her PR status as we know from Elon Elon Musk she's not untouchable she's actually got just way more to lose and I guess a lot of people are commenting on whether it was actually appropriate for her to announce a whole new album at the Grammys um not to mention a couple of little social faux pas around Lana Del Rey dragging her up on stage the snob of Selena um Celine Dion the Queen and it got me thinking okay because I've been thinking a lot about people pleasing and women and I just thought like I'm not that much of a people pleaser and I think that that's really great cause I'm kind of like just no that's not gonna hold me back I don't really care that much but then I was like reflecting lately that actually I kind of am a people pleaser just in the way that women just are because of the way that we're socialised and that it can play out in different ways and we know that Taylor Swift is a self identified people pleaser if you've watched Miss Americana always wanted to be the good girl and then it's just never enough for people and I've been thinking about the rap race and the kind of treadmill of success and you get stuck in this cycle and I think that that's what happened here with our friend Miss Swift and take this with a grain of salt because she's a billionaire she's a white woman and she's Taylor Swift so this is you know an ill formed thought but basically women tend to not feel entitled to our success we've been born into worlds that are vastly unequal and we're positioned as a second sex as Simone de Beauvoir says um we are made to feel like our destiny is tied to a lot of time our biology like our reproductive potential um and we know that we end up in domestic servitude I forgot one but basically men do feel entitled and women tend to not have that sense of entitlement over everything and everyone and therefore when we do achieve success we feel like we have to work twice as hard to earn it to earn the same recognition of success and that when we get it we have to keep showing people that we still deserve it by continuing to work not just twice as hard but I feel like it multiplies every time you achieve more status and more success so you're never like getting to an arrival point and going cool I achieved it I'm posting now it's like you get to that point you set that goal you hit that milestone girl and then you're like cool now I have to just like feel guilty do I deserve it did I work hard enough you know do I have to keep proving to everyone that I do deserve this the thing that I worked for because now I've got it I don't quite believe that I did deserve it and I don't I feel kind of like an imposter and now I just have to like work a million times harder to keep showing everyone that I do deserve it and then I achieve the next milestone and then I have to keep doing that again so I'm exhausted and I never feel like it's enough and I think that's what happened with Taylor Swift do I think it explains everything no like it is it's just one angle and one take but I feel like she has achieved like this just ridiculous level of like success like it's on undoubtable like it's whether or not you like it it's just not deniable um and it's almost like how does one person like come to terms with that within within themselves and Taylor Swift we know like she's a perfectionist we know she's always like I want that next thing I want that she never stops you know and it's like but when she gets it she probably feels this immense pressure to prove to everyone that she deserves it is the best is the best songwriter is the hardest worker to keep justifying the more and more success she get so that's why I feel like she announced her album apart from like obviously taking advantage of the sales it was of quite a like culturally blind thing to do in a lot of ways but I feel like she felt like she needed to because in order to accept her record breaking Grammy her fourth um the only person to get four um album of the year in order to accept is like huge thing beating like Stevie Wonder and everyone else in that category she had to then show that she is still the best and the most deserving by using that opportunity um well she used the earlier Grammy opportunity but still using that opportunity on that night to announce yet another album when everyone's like you just won Grammys for the that album you'd seem to have just released and now you're you know doing another one and you've surprised us all because we were just expecting a re recording and now you've done this and it's like yes she has to keep going like that next step and like my question is when does that end and how does that end and where does that go um and have you ever felt like that have you ever felt like the success that you have achieved um you then have to like justify retrospectively why you've achieved it by continuing to go harder than you did last time and do you ever feel like you're on that treadmill and you don't know when it ends and how to get off lastly I'll just say it is gendered it is gendered absolutely we know that rates of imposter syndrome and people pleasing are higher in women in gender diverse people in LGBTQ community in uh for people of colour for people who aren't basically like straight white men we know that they don't get that feeling of entitlement over just like claiming everything that they want in the world and then when they get it they must also feel and we must also feel um a sense of guilt or a sense of why me or a sense of yeah imposter imposter syndrome around the success that we do manage to achieve and so that is why it is it is gendered um intrinsically as an issue and yeah I would love to know your thoughts on that
