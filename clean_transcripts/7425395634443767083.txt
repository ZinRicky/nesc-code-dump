as homeschool on to two who are on different read levels I'm always looking for resources that can be used for both my kids and I found these phonics flashcards on the TikTok shop and they are perfect the set comes with four different levels level 1 is short vowels level 2 is blends and digraphs level 3 is Lung Vowel Silent E and Bossy R and Level 4 is tri graphs and those silent letter blends my second grader is going to be doing step two to practice blends it's really nice because it has the blend across the top and then different words that they can practice with that blend and there's also a sentence so they can practice reading those words in sentence my second grader is going to go back and forth between step 3 and step 4 she's gonna be practicing long vowels and she's also gonna be practicing some tri graphs so if you're a home school mom looking for new reading resources or just a mom wanting to help their child learn how to read I highly recommend you check these out
