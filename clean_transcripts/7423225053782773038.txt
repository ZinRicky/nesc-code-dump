let's understand how we got here after Roe v Wade was overturned the department of health and Human Services had a sneaking suspicion that red states were going to start denying emergency life saving care to pregnant people because…America. so they sent out a little PSA to states being like  don't forget that you federal obligations to provide emergency care to pregnant people who are still people. see  EMTALA is a federal law that says  if you're a hospital and someone comes in with an emergency medical condition you have to provide stabilizing treatment okay so the department was like hey states don't forget about EMTALA and here is specifically what they said they said just as a reminder if a physician believes that a pregnant patient comes to the ER and is experiencing an emergency medical condition and an abortion is a stabilizing treatment that is necessary to resolve the condition the physician must provide the treatment literally just saying if somebody comes in with a medical emergency and they need an abortion you have to treat them. so what do you think the state of Texas does? it sues The Department of health and Human Services just let that sink in the state of Texas sued over this this is what they're like no do we have to don't make us do that can't we just let her suffer and because we live in hell the district court sided with the state of Texas and basically told the department just let the state of Texas do whatever they want because we actually live in a place that's one step below how the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's order so the Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court they were like um hey you should hear this like really crazy stuff that's going on and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case they were like now we feel like it's fine the way it is okay so where does all that leave us so as of right now the federal government cannot require states to provide pregnant people with emergency care States like Texas can force pregnant people to lose their organs to become brain dead to get so sick that they go into septic shock and so much more all because they refuse to provide emergency life saving abortions I'm the feminist lawyer follow me if you enjoy being miserable
