we're talking about Trav wives again today and oh my god do I have a story for you TikTok ruined my husband of 12 years now he wants a Trav wife and we're getting divorced I'm gonna go through and summarize the article basically that like they got married they were never traditional couple they both work they both had the same hours at work and all of a sudden he started watching trad wife content and idolizing a specific content creator and started making like mean nasty comparative comments to her and talking about how now he wants a submissive trad wife even though she said she never wanted to be a homemaker or a stay at home mom and they had been living 12 years of their marriage with a very very equal dynamic and all of a sudden he's becomes verbally abusive he says he wants a submissive wife that he deserves better and yada yada yada he ends up contacting other women having emotional affairs and now they're getting divorced quote unquote because he deserves better now as someone who does have like a semi 50s aesthetic and is a stay at home mom I often get lumped into this idea of being a trad wife but I wanna start off by saying there's nothing wrong with having traditional gender roles as long as it's something as the woman you want to participate in and you feel safe and supported in doing so same thing with dressing modestly I don't think there's a problem with a woman choosing to dress modestly or a woman choosing to stay home with her children because that's how she feels the most fulfilled I think the problem comes in when that's the type of woman a man is searching for because usually they're doing that to search for somebody who they can be dominant over and trad wife content can kind of lean into the fantasies of men like this these men who are wishing to have this submissive dominant role within their marriages and what you see online absolutely has an element of fantasy and cosplay that gets lost in the social media literacy of some of these viewers that is one of the reasons I take a lot of issue with Trad Wife creators on TikTok who talk about this being the idealized and natural role of a woman because although that might be right for you making that a broad generalized statement can do some real harm to actual women and actual marriages like in that article
