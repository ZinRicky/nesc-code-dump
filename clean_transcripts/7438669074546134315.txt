So I live in Arizona where it is hot, or at least warm most of the year, so my fall winter clothing wardrobe is very very small. So I ordered some stuff from Shein because they're having their Black Friday sale. So here are some of the things I ordered. I thought that they would be cute like date night outfits. Um, I love the idea of like long sleeve dresses that are short with boots. I think that's so cute! It's comfy. Maybe if it's cold enough here. If I get lucky enough I will wear tights under them too. I will do like a try on haul too. I'm hoping they get here soon and I'm really excited to get to dress cozy for at least a couple months. Let me know if any of you have ordered these things and if you like them!
