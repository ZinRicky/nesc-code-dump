I've never fed my kids a PB and J sandwich before and wanted them to know what it tastes like, so I'm making them uncrustable look alikes except without all the junk. Rather than a store bought white bread that's got synthetic vitamins and preservatives, I'm making a sourdough bread using all purpose eincorn, which is the world's most ancient wheat variety that doesn't upset tummies and because it still has 85% of the brand, it's got all the necessary vitamins and minerals and won't spike insulin. I got started making a Berry jelly with some spent berries, lemon, a tad bit of coconut sugar. It tastes just like Smuckers without the high fructose corn syrup and citric acid. Because I'm making sourdough, I'll be finishing these sandwiches the next day and I'll be assembling them for the kids lunch boxes. I'm not a fan of peanut butter and it's not allowed at school because of peanut allergy, so we'll be using an organic sunflower butter instead. These are the cutest little uncrustable sandwiches that taste yummy yet will leave my kitties with lots of long lasting energy. And just like Uncrustables, they can easily be frozen too!
