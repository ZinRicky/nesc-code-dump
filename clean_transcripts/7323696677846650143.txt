So my last video on MLM's multi level marketing did ruffles and feathers, and honestly, it was a joke. But now, um, ha ha ha. I'm gonna show you financial disclosure list of how much, um, the average person makes with MLM companies. Okay, so let's start with Monet. Okay, so these are the different tears that you have here. Okay, this tear right here, that's 92% of people who sell Monet. Let's take a gamble on how much they make. Do you have your guess? Okay, on average, they make $133 a year. Okay, now let's look at young living. Okay, this is 64. 64% of their partners. What do we think they made the highest? Almost $600. The average is $22, guys. The average is $22. And now let's look at Amir. Amir, I don't know how you say this one, to be honest, but it's the people that sell, like, the happy juice stuff who are promising you that you're gonna have great gut health food, drink this juice. Um, Brand Partners. Let's see what percentage, uh, it is 86% of the people who sell it. And now let's see if you got your guess. $25 a month. See average compensation that. Only picking these companies because they're probably the most popular ones that I see a lot. But just so you know, MLMs who promised you that you're gonna make thousands of dollars. Unless you were in like the top percentage, you're not person who's promising You that you can make a lovable income at home on your phone? No. Based on these stats, no. Can you? Sure. Maybe. I don't know cause I've never done it. But I would like to see actual income stats from people who say this. Some line is that MLMs are not a get rich quick situation. You're not gonna make the average person. I'll just say the average person is not gonna make, um, thousands of dollars doing it. So just have some discernment. Probably going to be the last time I'm talking about Emma Lunch because for some reason they're so controversial. But just thought I'd put this out there if you want the general info.
