so I like to make sure that I show the good bad and ugly of state of motherhood and motherhood in general on my page and today is a really hard fucking day and I just wanna talk about a little bit because I know I'm not the only person who feels this way I feel like I'm failing at everything that I'm stretched so thin that I'm not accomplishing anything super well I feel like I'm being dragged behind semi truck that's going 100 miles per hour but there's no one at the wheel and I'm just holding onto a rope at the back of it and just it's not getting away from me but I'm definitely not in the driver's seat and I think I potentially stretched myself so thin trying to be good and on top of everything that I'm on top of absolutely nothing and I logically know the part of this is because we just got done with my daughter's birthday it was a lot of work it was a lot of effort it was like two days of not good sleep and I'm starting Monday kind of behind the aimball because of it but I feel completely drained I feel completely drained and I've so much to do and I feel paralyzed that I can't do anything because I'm gonna choose the wrong thing to focus on and then everything else won't get done that actually might be my add I've also been out of my meds for days because they had supply issues so instead of being on my adderall and like being able to think clearly I've been raw dogging this entire fucking weekend with extra shit to do and it is not going well my friends and today it just seems all so fucking impossible cooking and taking down Halloween and cleaning and doing laundry and getting everybody ready for cold weather and homeschooling the kids and making sure that they're learning cursive because all their friends in school are learning cursive even though I think it's fucking stupid and they're not gonna need cursive usually I talk to my husband about all this but he's losing his shit too because we are just trying to figure out the next chapter of our life and he is working so hard and he is burned out so we can't be lifting each other up because we're both dragging ourselves behind the semi truck and on top of everything I'm finally at a point where I think I just feel numb about the election and my fears for what's going forward I'm watching Donald Trump pick a cabinet that looks more like some sort of like super villain Batcave of egotistical piece of shit men um and I I just oh my god happy Thanksgiving I need a vacation and maybe a coma but like a small one just enough to feel really well rested
