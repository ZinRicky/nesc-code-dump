I'm a triwife content creator and I'm about to have my first baby I've been sharing my life online for the past decade and being an influencer has been incredible blessing as I've been able to bring in an income from my family but in a few short months my life as I know it will change I'm very open on social media but privacy is very important to me especially when it comes to the privacy of my child as I've been pregnant I've had time to reflect and observe what other content creators are doing and think about what I want for our child and our family the good news is that I won't be leaving I've been creating content for too long to stop at this point however I feel very strongly about keeping my child offline and therefore I want to let you know that I will not be a family blogger or a motherhood content creator motherhood will be a part of my content as my account is about my life or for my own sanity I don't want that to be my primary focus I have quickly found that mom shaming is very prevalent online and as a new mom I need to protect myself as much as possible I won't be showing my baby's face on social media and I don't intend to really show much of her at all for her own safety I intend to be very careful about what I share about her to minimize her digital footprint and keep her safe but just as importantly I don't want my child to grow up with a mom who's glued to her phone there's been a lot of talk about giving your children a 90s childhood and I love that right now I'm only working part time hours and my goal is to continue to work less than 20 hours a week ideally only 10 to 15 since my husband and I are both entrepreneurs we have flexible schedules and can also alternate working and parenting so both of us could work part time and then parent while the other person needs to work this will probably be more later on as Jane will need me a lot while she's little but I'm really grateful for this option anyway that's a few of my thoughts about being a mom and a content creator and balancing all of that let me know if you have any questions in the comments I'm looking forward to this journey
