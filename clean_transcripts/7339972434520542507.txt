listen up if you wanna assert your dominance as a woman say, in circumstances where another girl is flirting with your man in front of you here is what you should do! do not do not be like “he's taken, he's mine” don't do that! this only makes you seem unconfident or makes you seem like you need to control your man in front of her no, you don't do that! instead, what you should do is.. do nothing, absolutely nothing! just simply stand there and watch from afar or right there just watch/observe that’s the power move I've been in situations where randos would just come up to me and my partner and I'm sure they didn't make the obvious assumption that the girl right beside him is his woman they’ll try and shoot their shot okay what do they do? they come up to him say “hi I'm blah blah blah” touch his arms start laughing a little too hard at everything he's saying I know he's funny, he's mine that's besides the point. what do you instinctively probably want to do? Maybe grab a drink and throw it in her face?? but don't! don't do anything just watch/observe he's a grown adult man! I don't need to tell him how to shut it down or when to shut it down he can do it himself! We do not need to train grown men good manners We don't need to tell them how to appropriately react when a girl walks up to them it’s his responsibility to shut it down and let her know that he's taken the biggest power move is simply do nothing ladies just watch/observe he should be shutting you down! and if he's not, then maybe he's not the one. Maybe, he doesn't deserve to be your man. never ever force situations or have to remind your man what he has he should already know watch/observe watch how it plays out please just stand back to acknowledge the full situation at hand you know especially if you're drinking some things might be interpreted differently but just watch/observe So take this advice freely on how to assert your dominance as a woman
