bake with me as I prep food for my husband's boys weekend at the cottage I started off by making a couple loaves of sourdough bread because you always need some bread and then I made a big tray of macaroni and cheese just a perfect little snack or lunch and then their main meal was going to be some sourdough pizza so I made the dough the night before 4 and then I just rolled it out in the morning and I suck the crust with cheese so delicious because I wanted the pizza to just be stored in the freezer so it was super quick for them they could just throw in the oven it's ready to go the secret is to pre bake the crust put on all the toppings let it cool down and then just wrap it up and then of course I had to make a couple of treats so I made some chocolate chip cookies and some sourdough banana bread muffins they're so good and yeah that's everything
