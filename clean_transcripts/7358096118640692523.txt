When these mini sourdough bagels came across my feet, I knew I had to give them a try. My husband absolutely loves bagels, and for some reason I have never attempted to make them until now. This is our first attempt of making not just bagels, but sourdough bagels. I've talked about this before, but I have a gluten sensitivity, but for some reason, Italian flour does not affect me the way normal flour does. So I made these with Italian flower, and I think I flatten them out a little too much. Next time I'm definitely not going to flatten them as much as I did, but they still turned out absolutely beautiful. And they were so yummy for Jake and I to eat this morning. He was happy.
