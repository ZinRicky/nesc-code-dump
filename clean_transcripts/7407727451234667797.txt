bedtime will forever be my favourite time of the day but I still have a few more things to get through before I can finally say that's enough todaying for today and after what's already been quite a long day I gave my husband a look that said tag you're it and took myself off to an evening yoga class and normally by the time I make it to class it's already dark but tonight it was still light out which means summer is on its way and that just makes my little soul so happy cause I don't know about you but I'm ready to shake off the winter blues and soak up some D vitamin d of course my husband made the kids some spaghetti Bolognese while I was out but because I'm just so delusionally ready for some warmer weather I'm gonna eat like it's already here and all day I've been craving a really big chicken salad so that's what we're having But if you were to ask me where I was at mentally I'm deep in a court of silver flames and I'm just counting down the minutes before I can read it although I won't lie I was close to crying with joy tasting this because it was everything I needed it to be And so much more I need to know who else can't go to bed without cleaning up first because no matter how tired I am I will always force myself to do a quick whip around the house before I stop for the day I find I wake up in a much better head space and feel like I'm gonna be more productive if my house is at least a little bit reset I can't do any vacuuming cause mark’s in the other room tryna get the kids to sleep and also… I don't really want to I'm powering through this last part but the end is in sight but one thing I would take every night without fail is my HeadRest from BraveFace because honestly if I don't I am tossing and turning and overthinking all night They use chamomile and passionflower for the perfect combination to help me get to sleep and stay asleep and I've been taking it for almost two years and I genuinely swear by it
