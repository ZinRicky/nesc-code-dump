you know I really don't know many women that did get alimony or get child support in an amount that actually helps in any capacity so um yeah no I'm definitely like a single mom doing it on my own I actually pay him child support I've I've also heard so many women that that's the case like he has a restraining order against me um I pay him child support he is the one living with a partner who's paying for everything like total gold digger status like that the whole narrative that men try to make about women is really their projection all the stories about gold diggers and chasing them for this and that none of that is ever true it hasn't been true in a long time this system was built by men built for men and it serves men children are not the focus mothers don't matter the family court system is fucking brutal honestly that's why women like me Jenny Gage like all these women who have gone through the process are literally trying to scream from the rooftops to just give any piece of advice to other women that could potentially be entering a situation like this you know guard yourself in many ways financially emotionally don't let yourself get isolated and don't count on this system working for you when you decide to leave it it's probably gonna be a struggle but I would choose it any day over ever being back with him or ever being in that situation again or living with him so you know take that for what it's worth but no don't count on services from the court
