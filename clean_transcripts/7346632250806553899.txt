One thing I've noticed after talking to my closest friends is how they keep saying how I've changed At first that kind of threw me off but when I started thinking about it it's actually a compliment in fact I love that they've noticed which has made me reflect a little on the inner work that I've been doing I've completely rewired the way I think, how I operate, I've changed my living, I've even changed my identity so here are the things that I've done to change my life for the positive Before I always felt like I struggled with self sabotage I was toxic and unhappy and it made me feel like I was living the life that I didn't deserve so here's some of the things that I wish I worked on sooner number one establishing routine your inner self loves routine okay it's good and it makes you feel stable this will help build stability and it'll make you feel safe and obviously everyday brings on new obstacles but building a firm routine will help put your mind at ease your inner routine will just take over like do you shower in the morning or in the evening what are you gonna prepare for dinner if you have a routine and you find what works for you you don't have to think about it because you built that routine No.2 journaling journaling has been huge to help with my anxiety and stress basically I can just brain dump everything that's on my mind and put it to paper so it's not stuck in my head this helps me get things off my mind and it also helps me not brain dump on friends or family members this allows me to process my own thoughts through journaling now I don't journal every single day but for the most part when I do I've noticed a big change in my mind and the way I can function throughout the day basically when I put my thoughts on paper my brain feels less busy being self aware is so so important if you wanna see self growth and improvement No. 3 therapy I know you're probably like oh geez therapy not for me and I understand I've tried multiple therapist but you have to find the one that works for you you may think it's a waste of time but truly if you find the right therapist that works for you that's when you see real growth it takes trial and error not every therapist or person are you gonna click with and as exhausting as that sounds if you wanna see real improvement of your life it's gonna take work this will help you get over your own roadblocks and help heal your inner trauma No. 4 letting go of friends or bad habits that do not serve you let go of people that aren't good for you and I know it's hard but you just have to if you wanna improve the version of yourself you have to have to let go of the people that do not make you better the people you surround yourself with is very important because you become the people who you surround yourself with maybe you have a friend a fun friend who parties and doesn't take life seriously you gotta let them go if you don't wanna continue down that path honestly you have to protect your peace and your future selves peace I know it's hard but real growth and changing old habits is hard it's gonna be hard let go of the bad, to let the good into your life, that's essential for living the best version of your life so reflect on these things if you want to live the life you deserve and I'm curious do you do any of these things? or what do you do?
