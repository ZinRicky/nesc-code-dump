I have been very open about my childhood trauma and working with my therapist to do healing and I have even shared how I have been having a lot of nightmares recently so over the last couple weeks we kind of figure that there are two major reasons that I'm having these nightmares one is obviously the unresolved trauma and needing to work through and talk through specific situations that have happened and the second is like the fear of addiction and the fear of relapse and if you have ever dealt with addiction or know someone who has struggled with addiction you know that relapse is possible at any time and a lot of these dreams are from fear of then relapsing and completely upending the life that I have now so my therapist gave me some homework this week and it's to write down who I am even if that happens and the whole idea of this is to show that their actions don't hold that much weight in my life and I am giving it a lot more power than it should have and as I have been trying to write down like who I am I have realized that I am my own worst critic I am having a very hard time coming up with positive things about myself and now I feel like that is another thing that I needed to unpack this week in therapy
