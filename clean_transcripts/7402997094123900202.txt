You asked me if I'm going out tonight? no no I'm not I'm staying home where I pay my mortgage You know why? because what is the point? what am I gonna do at a bar? I’m gonna go to a bar and spend a lot of money on overpriced drinks Screaming in my friends ear over full volume music just so she can hear me say I'm going to the bathroom Gonna bump into drunk people listening to trap music Grinding all over each other/trying to grind on me Meet like five girls in the bathroom exchange numbers with them say we're gonna hang out and I never hear from them I’m gonna call an Uber and end up paying surcharge fees Wake up hungover by choice with hangxiety why would I do that?? When I could say in not wasting Money Lounge on the couch scrolling through hours of tik Tok with a nice warm cup of tea and feel energized for the next day No, I will not be going out tonight or tomorrow thank you so much for asking no.
