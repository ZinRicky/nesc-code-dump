as a homeschool mom I had a ton of stuff little manipulatives games cards all of the things and I needed a good place to store them that was easy to pull it out I could see what I had but it all had to be in the same place and I found this photo box on the TikTok shop that has 18 little boxes inside that are the perfect size to hold all of my games I have these little napkins I worked on last week and they fit in here so nicely I also have all of these like math cards these are math facts for them to work on and they also fit right in this container it fits so well I can store everything in one place and I can just pull them out so easy when I need an independent activity for my kids so if you also are a homeschool mom and you're looking for a way to store all the things you wanna get this photo storage box
