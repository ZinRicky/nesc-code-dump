I need to do some tidying in my kitchen and do some baking so come with me while we did that this morning so a few months back I hired a house cleaner one of my friends owns her own cleaning business and was having an opening around the same time that I was starting to be really sick from this pregnancy so just made so much sense my poor husband was trying so hard to keep up with dishes and laundry and cooking while working full time and taking care of his very ill wife it was such a load off our shoulders to be able to hire her and I'm so grateful that by doing social media I can afford little luxuries like outsourcing some of my cleaning my friend does four hours a week for us right now three on one day one another and washes all our dishes cleans the kitchen the bathroom and vacuums our house cannot stress how amazing this has been for us now that I've been feeling better and having more energy I am able to keep up with more cleaning and this day in particular I was able to do some organizing in the kitchen which felt so good anyway I just wanted to show you guys my wreck of a kitchen because I know that on social media it's so easy to think that everyone has perfect houses but the truth is we don't we just don't a lot of us don't show our mess but I think it's really important that you don't feel alone if your house looks like mine I don't want you to think that I have a perfect house of course we should be striving towards cleanliness and orderliness I know my mind feels so much clearer when my house is tidy but life happens and that just isn't realistic
