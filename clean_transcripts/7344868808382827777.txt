I asked my 59 month old my 108 month old and my 144 month old what they'd like to eat today and they all agreed on pizza I suspected that they were quite hungry because they were quite grumpy and also quite lethargic but I knew they wouldn't mind if I took a further four halfs of an hour for myself to do a quick full glam before getting started on my dough and this dough is a family secret my ancestors brought this recipe with them to Aotearoa on the Aurora which was one of the first migrant ships to come here in the 1800s and this recipe definitely did not come from the Dish website I lightly floured my surface and then began to take out any passive aggression that I might have towards my life on the dough and once it was as dense and fluffy as I am then I popped it into an oiled bowl and set it aside so it could rise and then it was time to get started on my pizza sauce and I find this process oddly cathartic because it reminds me of the lobotomy I got two years ago best decision that was ever made for me I foraged these tomatoes by hand from the shores of Muriwai Beach and combine them with these baby onions which I found at the local market which we call Woolies I pulverised the papercorns with the same methodology they used on my frontal lobe and then I added a few extra things in an attempt to make these tomatoes not taste like pure fkn cardboard I added some herbs which I pilfered from my neighbour's garden through a gap in the fence because I'm not actually allowed to leave the property without the accompaniment of a man then I combined the sauce which is always my favourite part for some weird reason then it was time to get started on our mozzarella cheese and everybody knows that mozzarella cheese taste best with fresh milk so I decided to head down to the garden and get some I also decided to pick up a few fresh eggs for breakfast tomorrow while I was there homesteading has been the most rewarding experience I could have ever wished for and our garden has never been so bountiful blessed be the fruit I started by heating my raw untreated milk to temperature and then adding exactly 7 tablespoons of homemade vinegar and I find the best way to make your own vinegar is just to wring out your husband's socks after he's had a long hard day sitting on his ass once the curd is separated from the whey you just squeeze the curd until the excess water is removed and I know it is very physically taxing work but I do find I get extra grip strength when I just think about the patriarchy and then we heat the whey again careful not to go past 69 degrees because my brother father and husband have all forbidden me from using that number and I'm not sure why but I trust that they have my best interest at heart and then plunge your two balls into ice cold water and I promise they won't shrink and then 423 and a half minutes after I first started it was time to give my dough a second knead and at this point the children were whinging that they were starving and I told them not to be so dramatic and that - like Christmas- dinner was coming I took my cheesy balls out of the cold water before thinly slicing them and confirming that the mozzarella was indeed squeaky and dense which is funny enough exactly how they describe me on my hospital intake form right before I had that procedure which I can't quite remember whether or not I told you about my memory is not what it used to be then I assembled the one pizza which took me literally all day to make but it's okay because I'm from the leisure class so I don't actually have to do any real domestic chores we have people for that at this point I was so excited to share my hard work with the children but I thought first I'd have a quick taste test to ensure quality control and as they observed me they decided they no longer felt like pizza and they actually wanted chicken nuggets so back to the kitchen I go
