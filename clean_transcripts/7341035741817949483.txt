Here's the thing I love about that fucking CNN article. Imagine not liking me and then seeing my face on fucking CNN. I just love that for them. I love that for them, for all the people who were for me to fail. How does it feel to see me in CNN though? How does that feel? Cause it feels good as fuck for me. And I know, like, you know, that's pretty valid. It's a pretty valid fucking news source to be like, wow, she's got a story, you know what I mean? Imagine not liking me right now, because it's fucking great being me right now. That's fucking great.
