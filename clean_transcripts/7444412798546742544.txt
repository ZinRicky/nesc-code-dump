this day couldn't have come soon enough because today is painting day and it blows my little mind if I'm honest that over 4 million people have supported us from afar and watched us work our asses off as we attempt to restore a 50 year old pool with no pool renovation experience and today we're gonna find out if 6 weeks of social isolation severe sleep deprivation extreme physical exhaustion and 17 minor mental breakdowns was worth it and right now I'm feeling pretty nervous about the paint colour you and I discussed which colour would be best from light to dark blue white or grey and funnily enough the most common answer in the comments was lavender which wasn't actually an option won't lie I kinda wish it was and as I was losing sleep over this I kept reminding myself that it's not actually that serious it's not like it's extremely fkn permanent will influence the colour of the water and change the entire aesthetic of the project or anything in the end we decided to go for a colour called Whisper Grey by Cotec which is the lightest shade that they have in their grey family This paint was such a dream to work with it was so thick and so satisfying to apply and it covered all the imperfections so nicely but while I was working with it I couldn't help but wonder if the influence of the collective consciousness was at play because I swear it was throwing lavender you can't really see it but you gonna have to trust me I'm also gonna need you to trust me on the cutting in I wanted the first coat to be nice and tight right to the tiles but my husband was waiting for a product to dry and he said I couldn't so now I just look like a really shit painter when I swear I'm not this is the first of three coats and I was so grateful to be painting alongside my wonderful father in law OG's will know BradDad Heâ€™s a laugh a minute and always keen to lend a hand and when we work together on a project which we've done quite a few over the years we call ourselves the B Team so today we're laying the first coat while simultaneously arguing over who gets to use the roller the roller was in hot demand because it was definitely the glory job It was so fkn satisfying to work with and if I'm perfectly honest I could hardly get it off him but I don't even mind because without him and my mother in law staying for a few days and helping we might not have even made it to this step so I'm just grateful And this moment right here pretty much sums up the end of painting day one extremely hot and bothered but also just beside myself with excitement so weather permitting you can apply one coat per day and we need to do three in total but we time shared it between the three of us so that everybody painted twice if that makes sense so Brad and I on coat 1 Mark and Brad on coat 2 and Mark and I on coat 3 and the vibes were so high by the time we got to coat 3 or maybe it was the paint fumes either way I'm exhausted but in a very good mood anyway so after this coat we need it to cure for five days and the way that I think about that is like if you're doing a gel manicure and you put your gel under the lamp and you take it out before the 60 seconds is up it's gonna be tacky right yean so it's like that anyway quick reminder of where we started and this is where we've got it to full disclosure unfortunately I'm gonna be painting that coping again cause I'm not actually that happy with it And yes you can still see some of that concrete texture but it is what it is and what it is is better than before and now finally it's time to fill her up and I'm so sorry but I'm posting in real time so please come back to find out what colour water we end up with
