if you're coming to my house for a playdate you can guarantee I'm making a snack board if your kids are anything like mine they're gonna be hungry in no time and will be interrupted every five minutes I'm also not gonna be feeding the kids food dyes or added sugar because I just cannot handle that chaos I like to make a high protein fruit dip with cottage cheese maple syrup and cinnamon it's so good and a great way to sneak protein into your kids diet my daughter loves it with her fruit and her Graham crackers today's snack board is loaded up with fresh fruits and veggies we've got apples strawberries mango bell peppers cucumbers cheese crackers Graham crackers and trail mix my friends always say their kids try new foods at my house because of these snack boards I like to make it extra full so we moms can have a snack too
