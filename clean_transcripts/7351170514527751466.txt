After a long day waiting around at the airport to not only go back home and hope for better luck the next day, I was really tired and went home to take a nap. Later that day I started making dinner with a few random ingredients I had in my home. Got started making my lightly sweetened, freshly milled eincorn zucchini bread butter, and then moved on to the main course, a coconut pot pie style chicken without the pie crust. Before we had left to the airport, I put a container freshly shredded pasture and primary chicken in the freezer, so this was a fast food meal that was ready to go. To make things interesting, I added some onion, carrots, herbs I grew in my garden last year, coconut milk, a little flour, and salt and pepper. While that simmered, I squeezed the juice out of a freshly grated zucchini and then let it sit to dry out a bit while we enjoyed dinner. The final batter came together in minutes with the addition of two backyard eggs for my chickens, vanilla coconut oil, and chopped walnuts, which unfortunately I didn't have time to sprout, something I normally like to do. Neutralized by the acid and enzyme inhibitors, this zucchini bread came out more perfect than I had hoped, with a crispy edge and that insanely undescribable but completely doable zucchini bread taste. Hoping our next flight goes out this bread is coming with.
