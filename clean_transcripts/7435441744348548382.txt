American women you are not oppressed I know everybody is telling you you are but the truth is if you are a woman living in the United States in the year 2024 you have more luxuries and more freedoms than 99% of human beings who have ever walked this earth if you wanna run for public office you can run for public office if you wanna own land or a business or a home you can do that if you wanna go to school and become a doctor or a lawyer or anything else you can if you wanna have children you can have children if you get pregnant and want an abortion you can have one if you wanna get pregnant and then decide in the third trimester that you actually don't wanna be a mom then you can just hop on over to one of the six or seven blue states that will allow you to do that and you can do it no questions asked how about it you wanna get married you can get married if you wanna get divorced you can get divorced and legally you will probably have the upper hand in that to be honest the most outspoken people who claim to be victims and all of this are well to do white women that's who I'm seeing and the be Frank all of the drama and the theatrics around this are why a lot of people don't take women seriously you can't look around at this country and all the freedoms that we have and all of the luxury that we have and claim to be oppressed you just can't I get it it sucks when your candidate doesn't win an election especially if you've been invested in it especially if you feel very passionate about them but let's be honest with ourselves we are privileged beyond belief and if you look at history and you look at your ancestors and you look at the women and the people who came before you you will very quickly realize just how privileged you are victimhood is real and oppression is real countries that victimize women exist but ours is not we are not victims and that is a wonderful thing
