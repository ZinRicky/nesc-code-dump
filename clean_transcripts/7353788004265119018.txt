there is no greater copwalker for men than the patriarchy I mean think about it the anti choice movement has literally made it dangerous for women to have sex with men putting aside the fact that women can go to jail for needing an abortion after having sex with a man the US has the worst mortality rate for pregnant women more women die in the US from pregnancy than in any other industrialized country and if we somehow don't die and end up giving birth have like a couple thousand dollars just lying around thanks to the patriarchal laws and the Republicans who uphold them you probably won't have access to maternity leave your partner if he's a man will not have access to paternity leave if your child gets sick good luck universal childcare l o L so while the goal of the anti choice movement and patriarchy is to like force women to have children to having the opposite effect just look at the 4B movement in South Korea patriarchal laws will not force women to have babies with men they're gonna force them to avoid them
