I’m constantly amazed how we as a society do not speak truthfully or honest to the people closest to us We think it’s hard to speak directly and we’re never fully truthful just to spare hurting someone's feelings why do we do that? I know not all circumstances are the same, but why are we so afraid to be honest? Don’t we want to surround ourselves with people who are willing to tell us the hard truth? How do we grow individuals if we're simply not willing to hear it? I need people around me that are truthful and honest even if it comes at the expense of my own feelings you're simply not helping me, if you can't be honest with me, don't dodge the issue, don't hesitate or withhold information from me, just tell me how it is don't tell me lies to my face just so you can spare my feelings so society believes that that's helpful, when really it's far from it I would 100% rather have my friends or people closest to me telling me how it is, than lie to my face. The people closest to you really should have your best interest at heart, so they should be willing to be upfront with you and honest, They should be direct and truthful to you even if it's hard and it hurts your feelings at times. basically what's the point of comforting someone with a lie?
