my husband made breakfast for the whole family this morning which is another way of saying my husband made a mess so we have a system in my house where the person who cooks doesn't have to do the dishes even though this rule kinda backfires on me cause I was always raised to clean up as I go but I digress and if you know me you know I dedicate a ridiculous amount of hours each week just trying to stay on top of the housework and I'm always looking for ways to make it quicker more effective and less tedious if I'm honest and about halfway through last year I stumbled across these Finish Ultimate Plus dishwashing tablets and honestly they're worth the hype because Finish Ultimate Plus is so effective at cleaning my dishes I don't even need to pre rinse them anymore if you're anything like me you'll know what a game changer that is I always get asked on my cleantoks what this little thing is it's a dishwasher freshener it smells really good and it lasts for ages and I popped it in along with my Finish Rinse Aid and dishwashing tablet and after my dishwasher was out here doing the most it's time for the moment of truth to see how Finish dealt with my dirty dishes and I'm not even surprised that there is no trace of the hard crusty egg yolk or baked on chocolate oats the glassware is sparkling and the stainless steel is so shiny it's a big yes from me
