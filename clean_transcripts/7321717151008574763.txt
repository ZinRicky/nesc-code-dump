And I found out all of the women here that used to be big deals. I mean, big deals. CEOs, executives, judges. Sarah Sunderson, she used to run an airline with that perfect skin. No, no, no. She didn't used to look like that. None of the women did. They copy? No, no coffee. Bobby, this is you. That's right, Joanna. This isn't me. It's a whole new me. I'm happy and I'm healthy.
