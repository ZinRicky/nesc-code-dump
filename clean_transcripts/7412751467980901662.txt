If this is any indicator of what the rest of you looks like, I'm good. I'm good. Nobody's trying to ruin your life. I promise you. Nobody's. Nobody's trying to ruin your life, homie. I'm sure that life was ruined way, way before ladies or anything came along, so you could just save it, okay? You don't gotta be defending nobody, okay? Why don't you go. Go work on yourself a little bit before you go out here running, defending the boys in them streets, okay?
