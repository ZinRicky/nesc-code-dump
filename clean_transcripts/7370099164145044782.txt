what is it with guys immediately coming on to dating apps and starting off like very vulgar and sexual and like don't say it's because I'm fat because I know that my like thin friends like also received this and just like what happened to like charm you know what happened to like class what happened to I don't know flirting like I just like why do men feel as other entitled to people's bodies like I just don't understand how we got to this point of like sexual liberation we're like women are being treated as objects again um and you know men are treating whoever they want as objects for their own sexual gratification like I'm sorry there's nothing like liberating or respectful or desirable about a man thinking that the first message they send a person should be inherently sexual and like degrading in nature it like I don't deny that this is probably exasturated because I'm fat I don't deny that literally in the slightest however I know that my thin friends also experience this and also have like inherently very sexual and like do meeting messages as like openers on dating apps and I just don't think that like that is something that we should be allowing I don't know I'm not like a brood I really am not but like what I just got a message oh my god like that's your opener are you insane have you ever spoken to a human being ever before like literally all of my friends who date men have experienced the same thing and so I know it's not just a like me being fat thing like I know that for a fact I just like don't understand why this is behavior has become normalized like I I don't know like also just like not as fun right like like I'm sorry but I'm not gonna lie I think a big part of like the fun is the like tension it's the like will they won't they it's the getting to know each other's the flirting it's the like I don't know it's the process of getting there and then just now we live in a world where it's like oh you know you imagine a dating app and immediately you're just gonna have sex it's like controversial no like what if we had a conversation for us what if you know you spoke to a human being I don't know I don't think it's much to ask I really don't think it's much to ask I don't think I asked for much and I think most of us don't ask for much I just think it's degrading
