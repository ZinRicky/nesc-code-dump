I think it is you the women who have had the most diabolical lies told to you when I wrote a book about men one of the things that surprised me the most in the research was that young men were more progressive than their fathers on every indicator except one they were more progressive when it came to climate change when it came to LGBTQ issues when it came to immigration but you know where they were actually less feminist than their fathers and it came to the issue of working mothers according to the research the male bread runner model the idea that it's better if a man goes out to work and if a woman stays with the kids is actually more popular today with men than it was in 1994 not seeing this trend just but millennial men were seeing it with Gen Z men this is a poll from just a few months ago that shows that Gen Z boys are actually more opposed to feminism than Boomer men I don't know about you but I have to like let that one sit so why is this happening well part of the issue is that we have an unfinished gender revolution we paid a lot of attention to changing the roles and the demands and the expectations on women so we said go out and work and be assertive and be confident and lean in and blah blah blah but there's been very little attention curiosity an openness to changing the role of men and when we do talk about changing men there's a lot of resistance to it I mean it literally occurs in this speech right uh this NFL player talks about you know men are being feminized you have to resist it so if women's rules are changing inside and outside the home and men's are not allowed that creates a problem it creates homes where women are still doing the bulk of of housework and expected to take care of the kid and work meanwhile there hasn't been an an adjustment to what that means for men right that there needs to be more of a role inside the home that there needs to be better policies to support that role with within the home I mean most paternity leave it in the world globally is still not taken let alone available especially in a country like the United States men still get mocked for taking fraternity leave that happened in our own government when people to judge just tried to take the rental leave he was ridiculed by other men so you know when he's like women have been told the most diabolical lies like no men have been told the most diabolical lies they have been denied their humanity their fatherhood in a country that doesn't primarily see men as fathers in the way that it primarily sees women as mothers so no one should be one thing right um women shouldn't just be pushed to be homemakers and men shouldn't just be pushed to be breadwinner we should be existing in a society and in workplaces that see us as as all of those things and ultimately sees us as more human so ironically it's when men are not gonna believe the dimolical lies you know of the patriarchy that we will actually be living in a society where we're all free and no one has to make these stupid speeches or be afraid of each other's freedom
