one thing I've Learned about being in a relationship is that you should never talk about your partner behind their back or complain about them to other people family members, co workers whatever it may be because A, that's none of their business And B, it'll make your friends family and co workers start to not like your partner that's just how it is theyâ€™re bias because they're your friend they're your coworker so they start looking at him as the evil person or her, whoever it may be if you have problems save that for therapy because complaining about your partner is never ever going to help I've been guilty of this okay I was young once I still am young But sometimes it feels nice to get things off your chest The best route is always going to therapy getting things off your chest that way not to your friends family or co workers Also nobody likes a complainer so if you're always complaining about things and you're not changing them or you're still staying in that relationship then people are gonna start not liking you that's just how it is because it does affect them even if you're complaining seems innocent it's not So try not to complain about your partner it's not helping anyone and it's really not fair to your partner
