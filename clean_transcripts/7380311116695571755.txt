so I posted on Instagram and Twitter about like not being sure who I'm gonna vote for in the election right because like what the fuck is gonna happen November I don't know obviously obviously I do not want Trump the way in which Democrats are going about talking about you know üçâ and Joe Biden's hand in it like they're so divorced from reality these guys literally in my reply saying well I'm #freeüçâ too but like we gotta vote for Joe Biden it's like I don't think you guys understand that like I'm watching every single day like children that look like my family like my cousins I'm Arab like people that look like they could be related to me being murdered every single day gside every single day babies ‚Äî every single day children being disabled everyday like I this is not like a you know like a far away issue for me I see these people and I'm like they could be related to me this is what my family looks like this is just like a campaign talking point like this is people's lives this is people's lives and there is such a callous disregard for people's lives and such an inherent selfishness coming from their Democratic Party sorry that I am grappling with the moral decision of what I'm gonna do in November because I cannot so easily dismiss the fact that there are people being genocided in another country at the hands of the United States government because I don't wanna risk my quality of life doesn't mean that I want Trump I know what Trump was I spent the entire four years that he was president talking about what Trump was doing I'm very aware the fact that despite that I still have this much resistance towards Biden should tell you something and everyone's like well what about the Supreme Court what about abortion and it's like what has happened under Biden Biden has not done anything to help either of those issues know what the Republicans wanna do if they win obviously I don't want that but the fact that y'all don't understand why this is so difficult and complex and you think it's like this easy decision oh I'm gonna vote for Biden and guilting people into voting for Biden instead of pushing Biden to do better is not gonna give you the outcome you want look I truly think he's gonna lose regardless because millions of people are feeling this way and when he loses it will not be the fault of the people that didn't vote for him it will be the fault of Biden and the Democrats for not earning people's votes for supporting this gside this isn't just like some political talking point these are people's lives so I apologize if I'm still having this moral dilemma but if you find it easy to just vote for the gsidal maniac it means you don't really fully understand what is happening this issue isn't actually impacting you the way that you think it is and I have never felt this helpless in my entire life and I wish that y'all would step away from your fucking keyboards for a little bit to understand the actual human lives are being affected by this in üçâ it's not just this like hot button topic that we're talking about on the internet again these are my people like these are Arab people they're my people angel to watch the way that you guys are speaking to Arab people
