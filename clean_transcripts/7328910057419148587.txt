My brain was too big for my skull. And it was crushing into my spine. And then all of my brain fluid was flowing into my spine. And then my spine was kind of, like, expanding from all of the fluid. So what they were going to do is they went into the back of my skull. And they removed two inches of my skull and my first vertebrae. So I have a nice big hole in the back of my head. My neurosurgeon came in and she talked to us, and she said that if we would have waited even two more weeks, then I would have been completely paralyzed from the neck down.
