let's make a Turkey for Thanksgiving we're doing a dry brine which will penetrate the meat for two to three days breaking down the muscle fibers and connective tissue which results in a tender more flavorful meat with a crispy skin after washing the thawed Turkey I dry it with paper towels and rub my salt and herb brine all over my Turkey inside the cavity the legs wings breast and underneath the Turkey too I seal it tightly with compostable cling wrap and let it brine in the fridge for three days removing the cling the day before I rose to allow the skin to dry out I stuff it with onion lemon fresh and dried thyme then use a pasty brush to cover the Turkey with melted butter and a sprinkling of salt and pepper Olympia helped me transfer the Turkey to the roasting rack which I had forgotten before I trust the Turkey using bakers twine to allow it to cook evenly this Turkey bakes for one hour at 425 degrees Fahrenheit then another two hours at 300 25 remove the bird from the oven when the thigh reads 175 Empress reads 1:55 while it rests the temperature will rise to 1 85 and 1 65 which is ideal and now it's time to make the gravy we begin and by making a roux of butter and flour then slowly adding a little bit of homemade chicken stock Turkey drippings which elevate the flavor skin constantly to allow it to thicken my entire from scratch Thanksgiving menu is posted
