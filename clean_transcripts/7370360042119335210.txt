okay this is the last video I'm gonna make on this topic before I go and like write a substack essay like musing about what is love but I think that it's such a more useful thing to say to women um that love is not enough love is simply not enough I think that's so much more useful than saying someone who mistreats you does not love you I think that saying someone who mistreats you doesn't love you and that's the bottom line I think that that could be useful advice for someone who just needs to like dump some loser man who's treating them like shit but that's not the full truth and it doesn't feel like the full truth to so many women I think it's so much more useful to say love is not enough because it validates the feelings that a woman might have toward a man and the feelings that she might feel he has toward her while also still pushing her to not let that man keep getting away with shit because even though I said in my video that I believe that the man who treated me worse than anyone has ever treated me I believe that he did have big deep feelings for me we might even use the L word here um I will also say with even more confidence that he hated me despised me wanted the worst for me was jealous of me was actively seeking my downfall and it took a long time for me to be able to reconcile all of that and to be able to tell myself that all of these things are true at once that he did have big deep feelings for me but also fucking hated me because of his own insecurities and that's just the tragedy of being human right like if it were not possible for someone who loves you to deeply wound you I think that we would be missing a lot of art and literature right we would be missing so much art so much art revolves around like the complicated tragic reality of the human heart about how love does not conquer all just in case it wasn't clear enough love is not enough if he's not treating you like a princess you need to leave him it's hard it's horrible it's literal Greek tragedy but you need to not let that man treat you that way
