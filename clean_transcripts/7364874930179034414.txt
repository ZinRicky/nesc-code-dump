I think the whole conversation about Mother's Day being for moms in the trenches has kind of gotten lost in the sauce here on TikTok. Made a lot of videos about this over the years. So I am definitely of the the mom with the young kids to do whatever the fuck she wants on Mother's Day. But here's the thing. If you, with a young child, wanna spend your Mother's Day with your mom, with your grandma, with other moms, you should do whatever you want to do. The point is that if a mom who has young kids wants to spend the day reading a book on the beach by herself and getting a moment of peace, that she should be able to do that without obligation or guilt. A lot of what's being lost in this conversation is that the mom with the young kids probably doesn't have a good boundary set with her mother or her grandmother or her mother in law. She routinely takes a back seat in her wants and needs. And she should be allowed to have one day where her wants and needs are considered, because although she's of course always gonna be her mother's daughter, she should be able to spend that day however she wants because she's not less of a mother than her own mother. She could probably use the break from packing the kids up and taking a back seat.
