Just a quick reminder for all the girlies who think they're just gonna marry somebody successful and they are set for life. That's not always the case. Sometimes they leave you. I'm not saying that's what her case is. I don't know shit about these people. I'm just saying don't think you're gonna marry you some rich man and stay together forever. Cause they can file divorce too. Don't trust a man. Don't trust a man.
