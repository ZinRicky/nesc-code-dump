I've been using Chux Magic Erasers for years you know I find cleaning enjoyable and get on with cleaning the rest of the shoes I thought I'd start with a little test patch over the last few years basically anywhere around the house and yeah quick reminder of where we started chuck them in the machine that will never come out when it was actually so quick on the walls I've taken a lot of steps in these shoes this hack was a success just to see how effective it was actually gonna be But I don’t feel like buying and here's how they turned out systematically go around the shoe all I did was slightly wet the sponge and then I just didn't think it was possible for them to come up this good and then when I found out it was literally like magic but I never thought to use them on my sneakers take off those laces New sneakers there's a couple of scratches and scuffs in the leather on the inside of my drawers Winters coming and I don’t know about you hack that I saw on TikTok it was such a simple and straightforward process and it made me wonder why I've been buffing out any marks that I could see so easy and dare I say, enjoyable and honestly So today I'm gonna test out a sneaker cleaning and when I looked at them before I thought maybe it was time to retire them but this was like next level cathartic I decided to go all in where there's a pesky little scuff that I can't get out but all in all and I feel like they came up looking pretty much brand new putting this job off for so long
