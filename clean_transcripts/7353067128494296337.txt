who did this so romantic friendships or relationship anarchy in your life today in sustaining relationship this was expressed through passionate letters a lot of women are actually trapped in abusive relationships I'm Doctor Zoe and I wanna talk about it um because of these systems where they've been told that a man will save them it was a culturally recognised phenomenon for women creating non hierarchical relationship structures queer movements have long spoken about concepts of chosen family like you can plan holidays together you can share resources with your friends at the end of the day you will never be alone plan dates together um really work on your communication together bell hooks in all about love you're the one who's likely to be financially worse off but this is distracting me so I'm gonna take it off now um are more important another thing that we're all looking for um is actually a system that does continue to prop up patriarchy but I'm really grateful for that it stands on the back of queer and feminist history you can do things with your friends that you would do typically with lovers I truly believe no one other person can do that in the 19th century there was this concept called romantic friendship are inherently more vulnerable in a relationship um that romantic relationships you're the one who's gonna have less of a wage and this is not at all a new idea the Sapphics created their own community in Paris and Berlin in the 20th century and serve capitalist and patriarchal values you'll be happier it felt quite like radical for her to say at the time um so some of the ways that you can practice um or sexual exclusivity should stand as the most important thing the women's liberation movement questioned the idea that as a woman and these romantic friendships existed alongside their heterosexual marriages got a little pimple there and remember that doing so is a feminist and radical act really defied the norms of the time from humans that there are so many other things you need because you won't be looking for them to give you literally every single thing you're the one who's more likely to be judged by society in those situations what they did was romantic or sexual in nature platonic love in a way that was um yeah and he understands and respects and honest that as well and your romantic relationships will be healthier as a result of that there was a group called the Bloomsbury Group in the early 20th century why is that an idea that you've maybe been raised with a lot of the time they practiced um they're a very influential group of like English intellectuals and artists about the very honest fact that I would not put him above my friends but I I'm in a relationship where I have conversations with my partner or maybe that you feel pressure to conform to learning that I was kind of raised from the beginning on that and I remember at the time feeling like that was a very new concept and then they end up vulnerable and in the control of that man or you don't think that's gonna happen to you they prioritise intellectual and emotional connections over romantic connection um or really isolated people who think that the nuclear family is all they need recognising that these relationship hierarchies are based off and start work on in your relationships advocates for an idea of love and relationships and I think that it is this is the fundamental thing to start to think about and you'll be healthier as a result of practicing these types of relationships and that idea is what leaves us seeing like these huge divorce raids you can really interrogate why you have these ideas Zoe you're friends are gonna be important than any man in your life and sometimes even physical intimacy as well and things like that which actually work to challenge and question Audrey Lord also talks a lot about the importance of community your relationship romantic relationship with a man um um uh and they don't need community as this creator says if you practice relationship anarchy in this way because marriage and the concept of just finding that one person that will place romantic relationships at the top or heteronormative nuclear family and the reason this is so important for women is because you as a woman and actually think about like and how important it is for solidarity among women specifically as well now I'm not against marriage or anything like that who practice these type of really intense friendships these lesbian Sapphic groups created these really close knit um you'll understand that and they were called romantic friendships communities and they weren't always um maybe your significant other can't give you every single thing you need less super be more likely to be landed with the children if there is a breakup and of course the suffix in a way that you would with a partner something that I hadn't really come across before you will be free to move around the world in a different way that's and why can't friends be our soulmate talk about difficult issues together in order to move through them and they actively practiced this form of relationship anarchy that encompasses all types of relationships but my second wave mum actually raised me on that idea and she used to say to me challenging relationship hierarchies you will never be alone and interrogate within yourself so this idea is a somewhat like radical idea of um and even if you're not in those situations the idea of the kind of heterosexual my friends are my lovers I don't practice a relationship model
