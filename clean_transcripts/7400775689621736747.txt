So I just got a really fun haul in from commence, and let's do a little try on Princess in the Meadow. I love it. It's a perfect dress for me for just, like, every day. I can run around with my kids with it, which is a little dangerous and white, but, you know, we live dangerously. And white is such a year round color here in Charleston. I know some people say not to wear it after Labor Day, but we don't adhere to rules. Right? And this is a coastal town. White is a all year round color. Oh, so cute. So the next one is this little red dress, which when I saw this, I was like, this is absolutely me. I love a red dress. My style is a little bit more like, vintage inspired, and this is the perfect, like, little out on the town summer dress. This is probably how I would style it with, like, super cute accessories. It also cinches in, in the back, which I really like, so it gives you really nice lines. Adorable. Love it. Okay, the last one is, like, very sexy nighttime, which is a little at my wheelhouse, so let's try it. Okay, stop it. Who is she? I don't usually wear things like this with, like, the low back and, like, the strap around this. That's a lot of side boob, too. Okay. But it's so sexy and it's very comfortable. This is definitely a Date night outfit. Summer date night. Cause it's still very hot. Um. Oh, but I love it. Which one's your favorite? Let me know in the comments.
