It's been a long day, as you're probably gonna be able to tell. I'm so tired. But I have the hardest time sleeping ever since I've been pregnant. I don't know what it is. So I asked my midwife, and she told me to make this tart cherry magnesium mocktail. And I've also seen it all over TikTok. I've actually been drinking it, and I feel like it's been helping. And Lucky's back, so I'm gonna make both of us one tonight. He's never had one, so. Okay. So I usually start with my magnesium. I do one scoop. I'm gonna do one scoop here, one scoop there. Then I put some tart cherry juice in, about this much. I give that a really good mix. You stop it over there. Cannot open bottles. Try it. I will try it. See? You're having trouble, too. No. Okay, well, that was quick. Thanks, honey. Put some ice in it. I don't like that much ice. I'm tired. Then I just top it with some sparkling water. Sometimes I do a soda, but today we're just gonna do this. There we go. I'm gonna report back in the morning and see whether he actually slept better. How do you sleep
