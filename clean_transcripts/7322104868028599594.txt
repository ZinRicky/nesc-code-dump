Okay, so my understanding of it is that because our society set is set up like a patriarchy, which means it is not set up to accommodate women, mothers, and families, is the reason why you had to make the choice in the first place. The world in which we live that makes women work like they don't have kids and have kids like they don't work is a function of the patriarchy. If we lived in a much more equitable society, it would be assumed that women could work and have children, and the workforce would be accommodating to that lifestyle change. The fact that women are faced with such impossible choices when having children and starting a family is because we don't have Equality. The choices we make seem so shitty because it was set up that way. Which is why if it's financially feasible, it does seem a lot easier to stay home with your children. Because that's the way our society was set up in the first place, for women to be home and men to be working. And that's why, as much as it, like, sucks to say it, that's why people come to my comments and tell me staying home is not a feminist choice.
