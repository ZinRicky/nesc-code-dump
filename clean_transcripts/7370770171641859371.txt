the reason of the body positive movement “failed” is because people did not transition to fat liberation body positivity is about learning to love yourself you and like your self confidence right fat liberation on the other hand is about like fat people as a whole and and and people in general unpacking the fatphobic societal beliefs that we are all instilled with by unpacking those beliefs and kind of taking away the like negative association with sadness that is what is going to make you consistently not only feel good (or at least neutral) in your body but also changes the way that you view the world like fat people in general other people's bodies in general like that is kind of in my opinion what the end goal was because personally yeah I love myself but that isn't always gonna be the easiest thing for everyone to do and it's like if you're let's say a fat person right and you're like you know I love myself even though I'm fat right it's like or you change your mindset and you ask yourself why is fatness seen as something negative to begin with and once you start unpacking that belief you kind of start like pulling at the thread of like what you were taught to think in an inherently fatphobic society and once you do that and unpack your biases against fatness you start to see the flaws in the way that this entire society talks about bodies talks about attractiveness talks about worth and how much worth is tied into what you look like and the problem is a lot of these content creators that were seeing kind of backpedaling they never made that leap right it was just about themselves and it was just about gaining an audience and like using that as a way to kind of perpetuate the brand further it was never about the collective it was never about changing the way that they actually viewed bodies and aesthetics and fatness and like just the society that we live in so that is why the body positive movement failed body positivity is about the self fat liberation is about the collective the way in which body positivity was co opted was never sustainable anyways it is very clear when people like get to a point in body positivity that is like beneficial for them but they don't do the extra work so those biases that they had against fatness and fat people and like whatever they're still there and they're still prevalent so now that's why we see this trend of like body positive creators losing weight and becoming fatphobic that's the problem you can lose weight that's fine but these people are 180ing from like a body positive platform to like an anti fat lose weight platform and that is the problem because it just shows that they never cared about community and that is what upsets people because it was a clearly selfish motivation and this isn't to say that if you're just body positive like you're a bad person or you're selfish no but I do personally believe that body positivity should be the stepping stone to fat liberation because once you change the way that you view the world as a whole and you think people's values should lay outside of their bodies and they should just be able to exist however they are in whatever state they are that I think is when we will achieve true freedom
