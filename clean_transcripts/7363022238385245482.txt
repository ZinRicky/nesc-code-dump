alright Veronica says it's outrageous one student was banned for five years from all campuses uh that's true and he just so happens to be a dear friend and comrade of mine um and we're gonna have him hop on the mic here on my TikTok uh this is Bryce and we're gonna let him set the record straight hey guys it's Bryce Greene uh organizer with the IU Divestment Coalition and I was one of the people who was arrested yesterday I am okay I am safe I am in contact with uh uh the jail support system that's pretty robust so we're all good there I would like to correct the record on one thing I was not banned from all campuses I was only banned from IU Bloomington this one which is why I'm sitting here on the sidewalk uh they banned me although there are people who say that it might not hold up uh there are people who say that my arrest might not hold up uh all that is being ran through the legal channels and I hope to be back on campus soon now I just wanna say people here are focused on a lot of important issues but one of the biggest ones is of course ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸ now why is it that the university decided to send a armoured car a wall of police with riot shields body armour machine guns assault rifle shotguns choppers in the sky drones in the sky and a damn sniper on the roof now why did they decide to deploy all of this against some students in the park with some tents the police they came by they said disperse your tent and you'll be fine if not we have all this lethal force at all of our disposal so does that make sense to you no it doesn't make sense unless you understand that they're doing it because they're so threatened by the student activism in support of ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸ that they have to bust out this military force that they have to demoralize people and traumatize people in order to maintain their authority in G they call this mowing the lawn and we get a small minuscule taste of it here when they met out military strength against students who are simply speaking their voice and it's just designed to terrorize humiliate and punish people who speak out for the truth and uh as long as we're intimidated we'll lose but if we understand that we are powerful world's ours baby thank you so much Bryce for your wise words of encouragement and empowerment of free ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸
