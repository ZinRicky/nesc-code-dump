When I was married and lived like a little tribe, like, I also kind of, like, not only did I hide behind my husband, like, in life, I hid in every way. Like, I wore gray all the time. Barely did I straightened my hair. I just did everything I could to minimize myself. And so now, in this era, we're going bright. We're going big, bright, bold. I'm not here to hide. I'm here to fucking show the fuck off until the day that I die. So this is, you know, more of what we're wearing these days. And I like it. I like it a lot.
