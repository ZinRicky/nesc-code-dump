so I'm on my way now to go vote um I'm still not entirely even sure what or who I'm gonna vote for I'm in New York right so it's a blue state regardless um so I actually was considering voting their party which I have very mixed feelings about but at this point I also don't know if I can stomach voting for hot one I like don't think I'll know exactly what I mean until I'm in the voting booth but like what's important right now is voting for local so that's like my I think that's like getting me there and I don't know like just this whole thing makes me feel really nauseous and uncomfortable because I really truly have a lot of issues with Kamala however I was in class the other day and my teacher was just like talking about like likelihood that Trump would be present like it's like a really fucking close race and I don't think it like what the reality of a Trump presidency again would look like really hit me until that very moment so yeah I definitely put the fear of god in me so I don't know what is gonna happen not telling you who to vote for as long as it's not Trump regardless of who it's for you should go vote
