my 147 month old came home requesting lemonade and because it's one of the easiest recipes in my repertoire I thought I would make it the voices have mostly stopped since my lobotomy so thankfully I've been allowed to have my knife privileges back which I must admit makes it a whole lot easier to get into a lemon and find a seed I headed into the homestead and found the perfect spot to plant my lemon tree I'm not actually allowed to leave the property without a male chaperone but I'm grateful I can plant whatever I like then I to harvest some fresh water for the base of my lemonade and because my father wisely decided not to waste money educating a girl I can't tell you how much I collected but I can tell you I carbonated it by creating a chemical reaction of carbon dioxide to give carbonates, bicarbonates and carbonic acid or something I don't actually know I just like bubbles Also please don't tell father I said that because you accused me of being a witch again and last time that ended in a lobotomy I went back down to the homestead and found that praise be my lemons were ready Blessed be the fruit vegetables and other things that I grow here I prepared my lemons for extraction and this can be quite physically demanding for a weak woman such as I but I find I get extra grip strength when I think about Project 2025 then I got started on my syrup which is as simple as I am it's just one part sugar one part water and the leftover lemon corpses and I let that reduce until the sugar disappeared just like my autonomy then I strained it and add the lemon juice back into the mixture and I put that in a cup with some ice and some of that water and prepared to serve it to the young master however while he was waiting he decided he was actually craving ginger beer so of course I will make him that and while I was looking for the ginger I found this extra bottle of water that my husband must have previously harvested it tasted weird, maybe like it was off but I liked it because it made me feelâ€¦ something then I started brewing my ginger beer and I'll update you in 4 to 6 weeks
