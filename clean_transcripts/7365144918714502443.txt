and this is what I'm talking about when I'm talking about fat fashion and the lack of accessibility I get invited to a party a nice party on Monday it's Friday I have looked at literally every option I called in the fat cavalry I checked in with my friends I look at the clothes that I have literally no option currently heading to Staten Island to visit my family and I'm gonna see now if there's anything that I can use that like I forgot that I own considering getting something tailored trying to find out what I can get shipped but it's Friday and like yes this would be like a kind of situation for anybody trying to find an outfit but when I say there are no options I'm not exaggerating I'm gonna go visit my family we're gonna have a car but there's nowhere to even drive to to try and find a place where I can shop in person because nowhere has my size look at the torrid in Staten Island maybe plus Brooklyn which is a vintage store that sells plus sizes but those are literally literally my only options it's just frustrating how difficult this entire endeavor is because like I'm so excited to do this with my friend like hang out we have a great time regardless but it's just so frustrating cause my friends like oh let's go shopping here let's look at this da da da and I'm like yes like awesome but still it's like I can't do that I have to figure out my shit on my own and they're like my my friends are like oh maybe I'll reach out to this person and like maybe they'll dress me like whatever and I'm like I can't wait to see the outfit but at the same time again it's just so frustrating how difficult it is to find clothing in our size literally the most evil position that a fat person can be in and it's just like I just wish we would have a little bit more options like a couple more places like if there was a handful a handful there's two and it's not even two within the city it's two within a two hour trip of me like I'm gonna look good regardless but god it's fucking annoying
