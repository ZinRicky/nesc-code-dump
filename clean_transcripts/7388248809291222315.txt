stop asking people if they forgive you when you're apologizing to them because it's shitty and it's manipulative and I will tell you why the purpose of an apology is not to garner forgiveness it's to show accountability meaning you understand that what you did was shitty and you are recognising to yourself that it was shitty and you're letting other people know that you know that it was shitty that does not require someone to forgive you and in many instances you are not deserving of forgiveness if during an apology you are asking the person you're apologizing to if they forgive you you are now putting the responsibility of absolving you of your wrongdoing onto them which they cannot do and if they don't feel like forgiving you you are making them very uncomfortable because you can absolutely move forward with a relationship in a positive way without forgiveness and this is especially important when you're apologizing to your kids because they shouldn't feel obligated to absolve you of your guilt a great way to pose this for children when you're apologizing to your kids if you've acted a fool is to finish the apology like this hey child of mine I'm sorry for doing this shitty thing I shouldn't have done it I recognise that it's wrong and you didn't deserve that I will try to do better in the future because that wasn't how I wanna handle myself can we move on from here or should we have more of a conversation about this so you feel okay now you can reword that however it feels natural to you but asking a child do you forgive me is trying to put a bow around a messy situation and it's okay for all of us to learn to stand in our own mess
