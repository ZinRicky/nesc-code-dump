Something I'll never understand is why is it so embarrassing to post on social media? when I love to scroll and see other people post when people I know or like post, I am elated I'm filled with joy! like what a pleasant gift it is that you're in this world and I get to share it with you! to see a picture with you and your kids, maybe your fur babies, Iâ€™m instantly filled me with joy meanwhile when I post like yikes you're so cringe delete delete that right now delete! In fact should I delete all my social media and wipe myself from the planet earth?
