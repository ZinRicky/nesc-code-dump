I'm fueling up for a day full of organising I promise the kids that I have their homeschool room organised and put together by the time they got home from their vacation and since I have no idea when they're gonna get home tomorrow I gotta get most of it done today I've been staring at this room for two weeks now hoping it would magically get done since I don't have a fairy godmother I guess I have to do it I ordered a bunch of different bins on Amazon for our manipulatives really like the ones with lids but I'm not quite sure about the colored ones but we're gonna give it a go they're a lot smaller than they looked in the picture and they don't fit right in the shelf that I had originally planned but it's fine because so far they're working really great for our art supply I spent most of my day going through a box of books and organising our bookshelf one side of the room is fun books for the kids to read and the other side is history science and reference book I originally wanted a shelf of science and a shelf of history the shelves are different heights and don't fit the books the right way so it end up just being a side of non fiction book even though I'm gonna give it my best effort we know it's not gonna stay that way cause the moment the kids get in the books they're gonna be all disheveled anyway I'm gonna do my best to get over my OCD waste cause I really want this room to be a space that they love and enjoy and come to often the end of the day I just really want them to love learning and love that we get to do it together as a family
