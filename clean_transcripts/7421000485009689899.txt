first of all I never supported a national ban I did during what I was running for Senate 2022 talk about setting some minimum national standard for a minimum national standard is literally the definition of a national abortion ban Vance supported a 15 week national abortion ban which means throughout the country no matter what state you're in you cannot get an abortion after 15 weeks that's what we call a national abortion ban he's somehow making it even more gross because he's trying to like wordsmith it so that it tricks you into believing that it's not exactly what it is
