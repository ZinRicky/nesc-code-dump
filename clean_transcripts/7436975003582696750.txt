this doesn't make me sound like an idiot but fight how like besides voting I mean okay so I don't think you sound like an idiot I don't think anyone sounds like an idiot for asking these questions this video is also about um how I don't know this like line of thinking that people shouldn't flee the country because they have an obligation to stay and fight fascism um and so the original poster is asking literally what can we do other than voting um I just wanna say that I find it really interesting that after the most discourse discussed election in US history ever um the people still have this widely held false belief that voting is the end all be all of political action in this country and obviously the number one reason for that misbelief or that misconception is the intentional suppression of left wing ideology people don't know what socialism is people don't know what communism is people don't know that there have been successful socialist revolutions throughout history people don't understand any of that there's a quote that gets thrown around a lot um why is it easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism a lot of people really do genuinely believe or they're at a loss as to how it's not true that Trump is here fascism is here climate change is here we're fucked we're all gonna die and for whatever it's worth I really don't think that you need to stay and fight is the take that people think that it is because honestly I think that if people can and want to leave the United States like it's completely inconsequential whether or not they do because it is such a small number of people who want to and are able to leave like we're not gonna suffer a significant drop in our population because of immigration also something that has made me feel better in this past week is the understanding that it also takes a very small amount of the population to actually conduct a successful revolution like I think before the election I was so worried about the prospect of getting at least 50% of the country on board with socialism and communism and then I realized wait a minute a lot of revolutions have happened with a very small percentage of the population so anyway what is to be done the famous question by Vladimir Lenin um I think you should get curious I think you should start looking into alternatives to capitalism capitalism is the reason why the world is the way it is um capitalism is the engine that makes white supremacy and patriarchy and all of that go I'm not the best resource on that I'm not an academic I've never claimed to be an academic or a scholar or an expert in the field um but if people wanna have a discussion or ask me some questions in the comments like fire away we can start from there
