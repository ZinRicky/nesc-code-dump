This stuff, you put it on like a primer, but it's made from Peter Thomas Roth. It'll firm up your skin while you're wearing it. I don't know if it has the same product in it, the same, like, chemical thing that goes, like, the woman, the really famous woman. But I do think it does help your skin, like, the texture of your skin over time. And it says it does it over time. I've been using it for, like, a week now, and I do feel like when I use it, my skin is a little more, like, Plumpy, Juicy. Nah, I don't know. I don't know. I like it. I got it, and it's linked right here if you want to, as well.
