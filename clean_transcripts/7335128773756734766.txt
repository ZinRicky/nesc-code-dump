Did feminists ever stop to consider that some of us did not wanna leave the kitchen? like I would make all the sandwiches and grab all the beers if it meant I could stay home I’d be content with that I don't want a man in my kitchen spraying the Pam all over the counters or seasonings covering it guys can't multitask and clean as they go I’d just be more stressed about the state that they leave my kitchen in stay out of my kitchen and I will stay out of the workplace I'd be okay with that I don't want Equality obviously I don't want someone to like physically hurt me but I don't wanna sit there and split all the bills I wanna be someone's dainty princess, feminine princess I want them to come home after hard day they see me they kiss me and all their stress just melts away I have dinner ready on the table when he comes home and he says this smells delicious it's the best meal I've ever had, enjoys every last bite, tells me how much he loves me that's what I want I don't want Equality you can have the workplace leave it to the men I'll stay in the kitchen
