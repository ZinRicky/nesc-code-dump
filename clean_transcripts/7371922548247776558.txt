I'm not one of those lawyers who can say oh I always knew I wanted to be a lawyer I don't think I thought about it once during all of undergrad but here are some things that I wish someone would have said to me that I think would have got me thinking you enjoy strategic board games where you're all bound by the same set of rules you have to work and maximize the cards that you're dealt with you need to mitigate your opponent just like in litigation second is you like going down rabbit holes if somebody's trying to tell you a story you've got follow up questions and you wanna go down this different rabbit hole with them about this new aspect that you're interested in you might be good at taking depositions it sounds like you're curious and you're interested and you're really involved when people are telling you things three you enjoy persuasion and psychology I studied marketing and undergrad because I thought well I really like understanding like why people do what they do what is persuasive to them how to communicate persuasively and those are all things that I use every day as a lawyer for you're naturally optimistic you might have a client who's gonna give you a lot of bad facts but you need to work with those bad facts and be curious enough to think like what's a different angle I could take on this as you lean into responsibility there's a lot of pressure and if you screw up it not only affects you but it can affect the lives of other people and even result in a malpractice suit against you let me know in the comments if this is a career that you're thinking about or if you think that maybe you'd make a good litigator
