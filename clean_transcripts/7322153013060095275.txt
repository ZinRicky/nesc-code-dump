I have also found that it is very beneficial to have somebody who works outside of the home and somebody who takes care of the home and in traditional gender roles that is always assumed to be the woman in the house and the man in the workforce now sometimes when I talk about gender roles I talk about it not necessarily being a bad thing because number one I adhere to pretty traditional gender roles when it comes to my role and responsibility within my home and I consider what I do what my husband does for our family as two pillars of structure with running a household however the gendering of these roles and responsibilities including giving one role responsibility far more power influence and respect than the other and then making that also a gendered norm is the inherent problem with traditional gender roles thankfully I'm not in a situation where I feel like I'm being exploited or disrespected or looked down upon for my role in my house but that is an individual situation because a lot of men can use that power dynamic to exploit and diminish their women
