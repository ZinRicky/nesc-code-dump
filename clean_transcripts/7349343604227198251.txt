now women are making videos that are like ladies if your fiance is current first of all women are amazing second of all I love this trend two uh women are basically using TikTok to tell on men who are cheating uh because yeah men who cheat on women are often doing it with other women and so there's a solidarity uh in sisterhood that allows women to reclaim power when it's taken away from them from men and I am researching this very thing and I need you to help me find other examples of women doing this whether it's on the internet or not obviously the Me Too movement was this but if you can think of any examples in history or in your personal life like share a way if you can think of any subversive ways that women are reclaiming power while still being in the confines of patriarchal structures but using them against sexism
