I love when I go to the grocery store and I'm optimistic like oh I'm gonna grab all the ingredients to make this extravagant dinner maybe I'll make a nice crusted chicken with potatoes or maybe even steak prepared with a nice salad options are endless as I'm grabbing all my ingredients then I get home, I stare at my ingredients, I'm tired, and I completely forget they once had the plan to become a beautiful meal what I reached for instead? crackers and cheese! maybe a pickle, girl dinner you know? and all the ingredients go bad, and then I'm like darn off to the grocery store again and the cycle repeats itself
