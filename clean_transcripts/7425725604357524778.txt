you wanna know why motherhood is so isolating and being a mom is so lonely because the second woman hops on a public forum whether that be TikTok social media or a mommy Facebook group and talks about how she's struggling or ways in which she is coping everyone dog piles on that woman and tells them that they are should never have their children like I haven't been chronically online this week as much as I usually am but I've seen the trend going around about the 17 diapers and correct me if I'm wrong this is a woman who posted a video where she was caring for her child and had 17 dirty diapers around her and y'all other mothers hopped on the internet to shame this woman for being unhygienic unclean and like not taking care of her baby properly because other mothers love to shame someone because the second that somebody's doing worse than you you think that you are doing better because the worst insult a mother can ever receive is being told that they are a bad mom cue the dog pilot cue the sanctum mommies instead of looking at that situation and empathizing being like wow someone who's really struggling would only be the type of person who's doing that that is not a healthy well functioning energetic happy well adjusted person wow she must be having a really hard time getting through the day no and it's because a woman's value is so ingrained in our society to be tied to her ability to mother and nurture that every single one of us is fucking terrified of being seen as a bad mom so instead of lifting each other up so the best common denominator is all of us coming together to help and make sure everyone's not struggling enter the mommy wars the keyboard warriors and I'm not defending an unhygienic environment for a child but what I am saying is I've had days where I could get off the floor so maybe if you've never suffered from postpartum depression or postpartum anxiety or postpartum OCD or postpartum psychosis you can sit there on your high horse and say I would never but calling somebody a shit mom does not make you a better mom and the only one who can tell you that you're a good mom is your grown ass kids there is the only opinion that matters so until you have a grown child who tells you that you were a fantastic parent and they want a parent just like you shut the fuck up
