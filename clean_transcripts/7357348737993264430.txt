yes I did forget that part Child Protective Services will interview each of your children individually as well one of my children is disabled and nonverbal they still pull her and like sit with her and attempt to talk to her but now they do it at school they have never had them do it at school before but this time they came to my house saying we've already met with the kids we've already talked to them we've heard their side so it's like because you better fucking be honest because kids are honest kids don't know how to lie and especially they catch them in the middle of the day at school the kid is gonna you know and you know say what what the fuck is going on in their life so also the the Child Protective Service investigators explain this to me and this is how I've always understood it it's not someone calling a claim against you both parents are like being investigated and both parents are on the chopping block this is an investigation into the children and the safety of their life and their environments that's why they go to both it doesn't matter who the report was called on that doesn't matter all that matters is something triggered a call and now Child Protective Services is looking out for these kids it's not like both parents are are under the microscope whether it was whether you're the parent that they're claiming something did something or not they're still looking at both parents equally as hard cause they're like well what is going on in these kids lives it's just an open door into the kids lives it's not necessarily like rawr you're the bad guy and they're looking at you some kind of way so like they all work this job and understand how it works and understand the people who call in calls you know what I mean like no one's oblivious to what's going on sometimes they just don't have a lot of power to do much or they do have power and they do take action but it's truly not as scary as you would think it is and that's all I was trying to get across
