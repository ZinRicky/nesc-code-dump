more and more conservatives are attacking divorce as the next way to curtail women's freedoms let me explain the latest quick background the US uses a no fault divorce system basically before the no fault divorce system which came out in the 70s you used to have to prove abuse or infidelity or something like that in order to get a divorce but now you can just say that you have irreconcilable differences and you can be granted a divorce No fault divorce is obviously good public policy it's bad public policy for the government to force couples to like non consensually stay in a marriage or to second guess why you no longer wanna be in this marriage but it's important to note that no fault divorce had particularized benefits for women who initiate nearly 70% of divorces when it emerged in the 70s it was credited with bolstering women's economic independence and providing safer routes for abuse survivors and it contributed to a whopping 20% decline in the female unalive rate so naturally a bunch of conservative men want to end no fall divorce they say that too many people are getting a divorce because it's too easy to get one and that if we made it harder to get a divorce that these couples would just work out their problems and go on to live a happy marriage again this is obviously bad public policy for the reasons I mentioned but also backlogged family law courts do not have the capacity to go back to a fault divorce system and like sift through people's detailed reasons as to why they deserve a divorce this is just one part of a larger scheme by the Conservative Party to roll back women's freedoms and our ability to equally participate in society they've gutted abortion rights they are doing everything they can to force women to perform non consensual reproductive labor at the risk of her own health life and dignity they are coming after birth control all of these public policy initiatives have the demonstrated consequence of decreasing women's economic independence and their ability to participate equally in the public sphere including politics of course I understand the outrage and the shock over the horrible things that this football player said but at the same time let's keep in mind that he articulated the Conservative Party's platform and their aspirations he's not like a one off extremist that's an entire party's active platform I'm the feminist lawyer I'm a litigator who has a background in gender policy and reproductive rights comment let me know if you have any questions or anything I can help with
