My husband doesn't cook, but he does bake and he's really good at it. And lately I've just been violently craving cookie dough, so he made me his famous recipe. He started by combining some white and brown sugar with some room temperature butter and an egg. Give that really good mix until everything was really smooth. He gets very, very specific with his measurements, so he always has to make sure everything is level and perfectly measured out. Added some vanilla baking powder and flaky sea salt and then some flour and mix that until everything was incorporated before he added in some more flour and oats. I don't really like chocolate chips so he only added a few so that would be really easy for me to just pick them out. This is the best cookie dough recipe that I've ever tasted, so obviously we had to try it. And yes, it was as good as we both remembered it cause we haven't made this in a while. Then he plated me up some cookie dough before he formed his into little balls and place them on a baking sheet to bake. We pop them in the oven for about eight minutes at 400 and then transfer them over to a wire rack to cool. I also made some homemade caramel sauce that we drizzled over a few of them.
