I absolutely love being a mum but sometimes I could do without standing in the kitchen for two hours at the end of every day So I'm trying to do my future self a solid by making a few ready made meals to pop in the freezer for later in the week and I'm gonna make them in the large GLAD SNAP LOCK Reseal Bags to lock in the flavour and also so I don't make a mess all through my freezer our first recipe is a yoghurt marinated chicken curry I've added Greek yoghurt, coconut milk lemon juice, garam masala ground coriander, turmeric and chili powder salt and pepper, fresh garlic and ginger, onion two capsicums and my chicken zip up that Double Lock Seal and when it turns green I know it's closed tight and ready to mix next is a herby lemon chicken start with oil, lemon zest red onion, capsicum courgette, herbs, chicken Dijon mustard, lemon juice salt and pepper and some dried tarragon Then I’m gonna zip up the bag, closing that seal nice and tight again And give it a wee mix Our last recipe is teriyaki ginger beef start with beef, garlic ginger, onion a green capsicum, some julienned carrots some sesame oil, half a cup of soy sauce a quarter of a cup of rice wine vinegar, and some brown sugar I know that's a lot of liquid to put in here but I'm confident that GLAD won't let me down then I'm gonna put these in the fridge for a few hours to let those flavours really marinate and deepen before popping them in the freezer Make sure you’ve squeezed out any Excess air to prevent Freezer burn. And when you’re ready just Defrost, bake and serve with Your sides of choice
