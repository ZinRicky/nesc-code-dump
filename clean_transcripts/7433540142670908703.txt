um Liz I'll start with you and your reaction to what we heard from Donald uh there this claim that he will protect women whether they like it or not and I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not might be the most truthful thing that Donald has ever said Donald has created a new cast system in America where pregnant women have become the untouchables and this is not my opinion these are the words of an expert in the field Sarah Rosenbaum who's talked to Pro Publica for their stories that you shared in the previous segment who is saying that er doctors are refusing to touch these pregnant women and so what we have is not just a handful of women what we have is thousands of women not being treated in you know going through one of the most dangerous things that you can go through as a woman which is childbirth right childbirth is actually far more uh safe than getting an aborshhhh and we're not talking again about a few just in Texas alone where two women have died of these abortion bans we know that the amount of pregnant women who are dying in childbirth has increased by 56% and so these politicians are creating a new hierarchy where they're at the top and the women who birth them and the women who will birth the next generation of Americans are at the bottom
