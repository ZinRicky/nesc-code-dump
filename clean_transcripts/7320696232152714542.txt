so first of all despite the cute thing that my kids said I absolutely have yelled at my kids before I talked on here before about how respectful parenting wasn't always my method of parenting and I have found my way into it and have gotten better with it over time to the point now that me yelling is such a rare occurrence that they don't even remember that I've done it so how do you teach your kids emotional regulation honestly you teach yourself emotional regulation first and how do you go about that well you look at what triggers you the most and you ask why it triggers you the most and then you do a great deal of therapy and healing because there's always a why now beyond that because I know that probably sounds super um difficult to start doing that sort of journey um modeling emotional regulation is the best way to teach your kids how to emotionally regulate so when I get super overwhelmed which we all do I'm neurodivergent I'm a stay at home mom my kids are with me 24 7 we're going to get overwhelmed I model things like taking a little break doing some deep breaths just standing in my body and being like before reacting and when you model those behaviors those are what you're teaching your kids to do when you get overwhelmed which is why I get very angry at my husband who has less good emotional regulation skills and throws giant man tantrum sometimes but if yelling is something you wanna stop doing it's okay that it can still happen every now and then as long as you apologize to your kids you have a conversation about why it's not like the appropriate response to something and you commit to do better or try to do better in the future and then back it up it's okay for parents to be human but we also have to be compassionate I also highly recommend the book The Whole Brain Child it taught me a lot about child development and their even ability to have emotional regulation and what kind of ages those things come into play and the conversations you're gonna have about appropriate emotional responses is gonna be different for the age of your children but we have had ongoing and repetitive conversations about how tantrums and outburst and yelling is the body's way of getting rid of all of the yucky big feelings that you're feeling and trying to throw them out into the universe so you can get rid of them but it really just gives them to other people and expands them instead of gets them away you cannot give your anger to someone else and expect it to get smaller that's the conversation I have with my kids and you'll notice when you yell at your kids you're not getting rid of your frustration and angry you can almost watch it shut down the communication with your kid and watch the your kid become more angry or more sad which is just big feelings turned inward everyone gets overwhelmed everyone gets ragy everyone gets a short fuse every now and then but practicing and trying to do better each time you get in a situation where you feel that way is the best way to do it and the best way to get help in doing that is to search your own demons I hope this helps
