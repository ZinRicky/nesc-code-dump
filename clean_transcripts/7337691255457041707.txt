a man doesn't just wanna marry a woman for her looks you’re probably rolling your eyes and yes initially men are drawn to women by their looks visually it's built in their DNA however a man doesn't just want looks he wants a woman to be his peace looks will only take you so far but what a man really wants and needs is peace you need to be his peace okay a man's job is provide for you he's already dealing with stress with work the last thing he needs to deal with is toxic behavior in a relationship or in a woman he’s stressed from work trying to provide for you to keep you happy so the last thing he needs is to add more stress on top of that when he gets off work he needs to come home to a peaceful environment he needs you to be his peace you should be the one that melts all his stress away after a long day you can be the most beautiful girl in the world but if you're always drama and you have toxic behaviour your man is he's gonna get bored with you okay he's gonna run for the hills it's not gonna last a man finds out behaviour very boring let's face it, men do not have a taste for drama if you really want a long lasting love with your partner your man stop considering so much about your appearance and start thinking more about your behaviour really just focus on how you can be his peace make sure the house environment is nice and tidy there's food made make sure that when he gets home from work he's happy and he's happy being there don’t add to his stress we all know how that old saying goes, “looks eventually fade” let's face it, if looks are all you provide then I think you need to dig a little bit deeper into yourself
