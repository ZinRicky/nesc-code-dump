staying married because you have kids with somebody is literally the dumbest thing you can do and I'm gonna give you scientific research why so a lot of people will say well I'll stay for the kids and at least I'll at least stay until they turn 18 until like they start their own life but as you see that from Stanford the teen brain tunes in less to Mom's voice more to unfamiliar voices why is this important so as you can see the Stanford team previously found out that in the brains of children 12 and under hearing Mom's voice triggers an explosion of unique responses The Mother's Voice is the sound source that teaches young kids all about the social emotional world around age 13 kids brains no longer find their mom's voice uniquely rewarding and they tune into unfamiliar voices more this is coming from the Stanford School of medicine so not only are you deciding to give up your child's most formative years they only get one childhood you're gonna give up all those childhood years where the your child is tuned in to listen to you they know who you are they love you they're looking to you for guidance you're gonna choose those years to stay in an abusive marriage give most of your attention and energy to that one and then when your child they've they've they've kinda grown out of that moment that's when you're gonna choose to leave your marriage and then try to work on your relationship with your child it's completely fucking backwards you don't need to be married to be a good mother you don't need to stay in a relationship to provide for your children the world isn't as fucking scary as you think it is you can get out and you can make it and you need to if you wanna
