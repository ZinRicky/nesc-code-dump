to help extend the life of the filters you use with your CPAP machine if you place an air purifier right below it it's gonna clean the air that's getting fed straight into your CPAP machine so it's not like I'm trying to purify all the air in the whole entire room I'm just trying to make sure that where the CPAP is placed it's kind of like getting fed the cleanest air so that it's easier on the CPAP and other people on the internet have talked about this it really is helpful I got this one from the TikTok shop I really really like it it's really helpful it has a child lock so little fingers are not gonna come and accidentally turn it off and it has a timer so just right before you turn the C pop machine on you hit the timer button to make sure that it's only gonna run for the eight hours it's really quiet and it really does help the C pop machine at be as effective as it can be because it's not working hard to clean the air and the filter in here is only one little layer of Protection so this really does add another layer of Protection for breathing all night long like this is the air that's getting shoved down your airway all night long so I like to make sure it's as clean as possible cause it's for my daughter and she's you know
