I'm a stay at home mum in my 30s which means I'm balls deep in my homemade bread phase and once you make this focaccia you will be too because what else are you gonna do all day? and if you're a focaccia master stay to the end and tell me how I can make it more bubbly because I've tried and tried and this is as aerated as I can make my dough  mix tbsp of yeast with 420ml of warm water and a teaspoon of honey add a tbsp of olive oil 500 grams of bread flour and two teaspoons of salt give it a good mix until your dough starts to come together and at this point it's gonna be extremely sticky so don't be alarmed, it's totally normal cover it with a tea towel let it rest for 15 minutes and then start on your first round of stretch and folds with wet hands gently pull the dough up fold it in the middle and spin the bowl and I try and work my way around the bowl about three times let it rest under your tea towel for another 15 minutes and then perform another round of the stretch and folds now we wanna let it rest for about an hour and a half before transferring it to a tray lined with Parchment paper which I've also oiled give it a little stretch and then you wanna fold it back and on itself a bit like a burrito before flipping it over so that the smooth side is facing up she's gonna be a bit tired from all that exercise so leave her alone for another hour and a half cover it with oil then you wanna get your fingers in there and start making some dimples They don't have to be perfect but it is a vital step it's gonna expel some of that air and help make your crust beautiful and crispy the fun thing with focaccia is you can kinda top it with whatever you like so it's up to you if you wanna make it more simple or more intricate I'm going simple today cause in my house we all love this combination of Kelp salt and Rosemary and if you oil herbs before popping them on it's gonna help stop them from burning bake it on the lowest rack in your oven at 220 degrees C for about 20 minutes or until crispy and golden but fair warning once you make it once you're gonna start making it everyday and it's gonna completely consume your life
