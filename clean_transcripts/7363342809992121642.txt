and this is why it's important for women to continue to share our stories to continue to communicate with each other because it can take years for you to realise what you went through when you're with a toxic partner and when women have that pick me girl spirit and this competitiveness with each other that doesn't help you know what I mean it's when we come together and say yeah I've been in that place or whatever you know so thank you for sharing your story
