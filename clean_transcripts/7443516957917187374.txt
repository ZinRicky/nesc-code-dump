I'm sitting down to lesson plan for the week and I wanted to show you these 10 strings of boards that I am using they come with six 10 strings boards they have the numbers one through 10 on them and they come with three different sets of cards these are one to one correspondent so you can practice pushing just the number and tracing the number these are addition problems where you need to find the missing add in and these are word problems I'm gonna be using these this week to practice addition and subtracting my parents from word problems these are really great for homeschooling they're also really great if you are a classroom teacher working with small groups
