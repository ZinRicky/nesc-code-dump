How do we feel about our boyfriends fiancé’s/husbands having a girl best friend? my fiance absolutely has a girl best friend They do everything together they go out on weekends they hang out during the weekday they watch Netflix hang out on the couch They cuddle play board games They have a drink, eat their favorite snacks together They talk all the time texting, FaceTime even Snapchat You name it they're doing all of it They rarely go a day without ever speaking In fact I don't even think they've ever gone a day without speaking They even go on vacation together it's great because he has someone that he never gets tired of Always wants to be with they always wanna hang out never gets bored to hang out with her It’s great because that girl is me she is me I am her I'm his only girl best friend his only best friend
