much like the rest of them today is gonna be a sprint and a marathon I've just got the kids to school and I've got about 15 minutes before I need to be out the door myself because I'm currently running late for athletics day and I'm well aware of the fact that the day here is about to be ridiculous so I'm gonna put the Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Lift & Firm Cream makeup to the ultimate test it's perfect for these busy days because there’s actually anti-ageing technology within the makeup and it gives a lovely medium to full coverage while still feeling lightweight like it feels like I'm just wearing moisturiser and lately in an attempt to not look so exhausted all the time I've been loving popping a swipe of glitter over the eyelid from my daily look soft and neutral but definitely adds a little something I'm using one of Elizabeth Arden’s new eyeshadow quads in shade Profoundly Pink also have Oh So Neutral and Desert Nudes they're really nicely pigmented and they're definitely gonna be my go to for event season okay we had time for makeup definitely not hair cause I was meant to be there 3 minutes ago and my inner child really hates it whenever I'm late I cheered my girl on, popped past the bakery split lunch with my husband in the pool and quietly try not to freak out about all of the things that I need to then I got distracted by my garden and did some admin before picking the kids up even though I was running around hot and sweaty all day I feel like the makeup really held up there was minimal separation and no creasing and that's with no touch ups by the way and then finally I'm back where I belong
