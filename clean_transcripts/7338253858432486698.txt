can we just take a second to recognise how nice it is to have a man that takes care of everything I man that leads, takes control, and has the house in order you don't even have to use your brain you can just turn your brain off and then you can close your eyes and follow him blindly and you trust and know that wherever he leads you you'll be happy like you're good anything and everything is already taken care of for you he regularly plans date nights makes the reservations does all the planning you don't even have to think about anything he just tells you date time place what to wear and you're all set there's no stress or confusion because he did all the planning I don't have to worry about it even something as small as bringing me coffee in the morning pumping my gas he does these things without me even having to ask because he knows it makes me happy a man who is masculine a manly man a guy who takes charge I think that's one of the most attractive traits a man can have a man who you don't have to ask for energy towards you you don't have to ask him if he's gotten things done he's already done it you can turn off your brain close your eyes and follow him blindly he's got everything taken care of what's great about this is it allows us woman to be in our feminine energy because he's so masculine that we can go ahead and sit back and relax and be at peace we can compliment each other in our different roles so if you have a man like this make sure you recognise his good behaviour and show him appreciation
