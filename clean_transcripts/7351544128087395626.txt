Mioki. They replaced her cup and it's been amazing. It's a million times better than the other cup. The handle is soft. It makes it easier to hold. She can still drink from the straw the way I like, but it also has the mouthpiece. And she has been practicing drinking this way. Like, she's so excited with her cup. It's pink and it's sparkly. They reached out to me cause they felt really bad that she got her stupid other cup stolen. So now we don't worry about that cup. We have the Mioki Cup if you want to buy one. They're linked right here. It was very, very sweet of them to replace it with, like, pretty much way better version, so.
