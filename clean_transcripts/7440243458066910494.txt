All of you are so sweet. And here's a small update I had to pick up. She's not allowed to bring her computer and stuff home, so I had to. Since it's like a long weekend, I had to go pick it up. So I got to see her today and I was like, oh, my god, I'm so sorry that I got the dates wrong. But I remembered. I was like, the reason I got the dates wrong was cause I remembered that today was the day that the results were coming out. That's why Friday stuck out in my head. So that's why I was reaching out to her. And I do text her every day. So I did talk to her yesterday. I just didn't, like, specifically wish her well on the thing. And she still has a chance at getting apart. It was just callbacks so she could still be cast in. Maybe, like, a more minor role, I guess. Maybe. I don't know. But it wasn't the end of the world. And I did get to give her a big, like, multiple.
