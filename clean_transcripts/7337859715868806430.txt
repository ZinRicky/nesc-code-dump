pro choice activists have been saying this for a long time they are coming after IVF they are coming after birth control So here's what happened basically there are three couples whose frozen embryos were accidentally destroyed at a fertility clinic in Alabama which is obviously awful The Alabama Supreme Court took this as an opportunity to be like yeah well destroying frozen embryos is the same thing as murdering a child because frozen embryos are children for purposes of interpreting state law and then Justice Parker wrote separately and just went full theocracy like cited the Bible throughout his concurrence you need to understand that this opinion is part of a much broader anti choice effort to establish fetal personhood the goal of the fetal personhood movement is to get state and federal courts to declare that fetuses and embryos have constitutional rights just like you and I this is really strategic because the anti choice movement knows that the vast majority of Americans support abortion access so we're seeing a lot of ballot initiatives in states where citizens are going and voting to have abortion rights embedded in their state constitution and it's a major issue driving people to the polls to protect reproductive rates so think about it if anti abortion activist and the Republican Party can stack these courts and then they can get those courts to establish fetal personhood then any democratic measures by the people would be impossible to protect abortion rights because if your state constitution says that fetuses and embryos have constitutional rights just like every other alive person then you wouldn't be able to put in any legislation that like people can have abortions okay I digress there so let's back up so by stating that frozen embryos are children under the law the Alabama Supreme Court is effectively jeopardizing the future of IVF in the entire state how could any clinic operate in that state knowing that if any accident happens they might have homicide charges brought against them many couples who do IVF if they have leftover embryos they might donate them to other couples they might donate them to science and a lot of individuals end up discarding embryos which they now wouldn't be able to do and you know they're bringing these cases in other states to do everything they can to limit reproductive choice reproductive assistance and reproductive technology I'm the feminist lawyer put any questions that you might have in the comments
