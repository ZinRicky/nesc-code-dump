I'm happy to show you how I shape my nails I do it all at home myself because I'm a single mom and I don't wanna pay somebody to do something so simple and I do do it keep it very simple I just use a regular nail file and some cuticle oil the nail file is really rough on one side for the shaping like when they're really kinda out of shape and I need to get them down into shape and then the smoother side is for smoothing that out like after it's nice and shaped I can just go over it back and forth to smooth out the shape and really what I do is I pull my skin really tight to get the nail file really pressed up in the nail bed and that's where I do the shaping because that's where my nail is the weakest and that's where it hurts the most when it breaks so I just keep it pressed up against there and then I shape it again to keep it thin so that there's less of it to break they look long but there's really less hanging over to be able to break and then I smooth it out and then I always finish with cuticle oil and one tiny little drop is all you need and if you do end up getting a lot like that's a lot you can do that little bit with all of your nails and I do that before showers
