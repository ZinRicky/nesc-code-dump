okay let's go ahead and unpack this comment because you started it by calling my children in general spawn so you just wanted to humanize you even admit that it's derogatory but you don't care because you were a jerk who's happy being a jerk and that's fine I wanna touch on the second part of this conversation which is that um bad child behavior is an epidemic in this country and that teachers are even commenting it because I have also seen all those videos and I am also a parent within the community and I've seen all sorts of parenting and all sorts of the results of it so let's come have a conversation because I would agree that a lot of the what we're gonna call bad parenting that other people seem to believe creates bad behave children and I don't like using the word bad but just for the sake of this argument you know what I'm talking about it's usually permissive parenting because authoritarian parenting makes kids afraid of adults permissive parenting is a lack of boundaries and structure the path of least resistance those the parents that you see ignoring their children climbing the walls at an establishment and you're thinking don't they see this can't they do something about that but whereas teachers are making this content because they would like to provide a more conducive and safe learning environment for the children that are under their charge and a better work environment for themselves um you're just worried about your own individual comfort so we're not gonna worry about that because I don't care about your individual comfort what I do care about is children and parents and teachers because when we notice there's a problem when we acknowledge that there is an issue and that permissive parenting is probably the issue we have to look at the why if you actually wanna solve anything and be constructive so why is permissive parenting becoming such a big thing it's not that this is just a random group of individuals who just decided you know what I just don't care what my kids do whatever no it is because setting boundaries holding expectations of parenting thoughtfully has a an excessive amount of energy resources and effort needed to do that something that societally we do not make easy for parent most households right now are two working income parents which means parents are getting home at the end of the day already exhausted already depleted probably working more than they should for less than they're being paid for dealing with increasing behaviour problems because of access to technology and social media as well as a society that sets up absolutely no safety nets for our parents and children has no subsidized child care no government aid really for parents in the form of maternity paternity healthcare we also have school systems who are not equipped to follow things like 504 and IEPs correctly for kids that do have higher needs and then on top of it we have parents that are increasingly isolated we have communities that do not bond together that do not create a village what we have is a society that wants to shame and blame like you because what is good for parents what is good for children and what is good for society as a whole is for parents and children to be out in a social setting with the mentality of a collective village all looking out for these kids um but instead so that's a perfect storm it's a perfect storm of overworked underserved socially ostracized people with children and that's assuming two parent households of which we're not even acknowledging the immense amount of energy and exhaustion and work that is put on the shoulder of single parents so they take the path of least resistance but instead of making this an individualistic problem this is a one parent who's just a bad parent we could actually look at how we collectively handle children pregnancy families and make a society that would be conducive to collective parenting to respectful parenting to parenting with consciousness and effort cause the reality is parents can't do it alone they were never meant to and they definitely were never meant to do it under the strains of capitalism so if you really give a shit let's talk about the why
