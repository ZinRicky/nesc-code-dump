I hear you, I understand. And I super see the validity in that and I support you in that. And yeah, I get it. I super get it. That's. I'm not. I don't think it's wrong to do that. I just. That's why I just wanted to make it clear why I'm not doing that. But I super understand people who do say, that's just too much for me personally. For me, it's not too much. Cause I know I needed those people to still be in my life and I wouldn't be here without them. So I feel like it's my job to be one of those people. Like, that is my role. So love all, you know. My love to you.
