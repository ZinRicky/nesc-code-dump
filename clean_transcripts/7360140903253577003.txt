it's like 10:30 at night and my husband and I are both just staring into the abysses of our phone trying to unwind from the day with three kids and I think I realized something very significant just now and that is before having kids I thought that relaxed was just like a step on the way to tired like it went like alert awake relaxed tired and now as a parent and in my mid thirties I think I'm very well aware that you could be tired and not be relaxed at all
