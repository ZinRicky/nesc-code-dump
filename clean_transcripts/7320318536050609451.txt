You guys know how important hydration is for my skin, so I had to find products that do exactly that. One of them is this. MAC Hyperreal Ceramizer. Uses niacinamide to retextracize your skin while also strengthening your skin barrier. Then I layer on the Skin. Canvas Balm moisturizer, which is so hydrating and leaves me super moisturized. Uses hyaluronic acid to hydrate and smooth your skin. Then I used a cream blush and some lip gloss for my glowy look.
