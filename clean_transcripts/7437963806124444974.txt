If you're a mom and you want kid proof furniture, let me put you on to my favorite bar stools. I have four of these. I love them because they come in a lot of different colors. My favorite thing about them is that they look like their cloth, but it's kind of like a pleather. They are so easy to wash. My son spilled an entire cup of chocolate milk on this. It was so easy to clean and there's no smell. If you have kids, you know how hard it is to get anything out of a poster chairs, and these are so, so nice. Come as a set of two, and I have four of them. I absolutely love the quality of these.
