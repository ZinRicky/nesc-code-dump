It didn't even dawn on me to use this to chop down a Christmas tree. I have always wanted to do that Christmas tradition. And you're right. This is the perfect fucking tool for that. You can do both of the batteries. This the chainsaw. It's light. It's about the size of a lunch box. Oh, my god. Thank you for enlightening me. This is. That's adorable. Oh, my god. Imagine that. Mom takes them out to cut down the fucking Christmas tree myself. We don't need a man. What a good idea.
