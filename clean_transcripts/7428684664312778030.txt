one of the things I hear all the time from people who don't homeschool is I don't have the patience for them honey I don't either at least not every day and today was one of those days that my patients was very thin but now with everything just a certain we're playing the fidget game and for the first time ever my daughter did not struggle with any of the work but her counting and popping the popper almost did me it took her a solid 45 seconds to count to four and pop the popper after four or five rounds of that I couldn't play anymore it's a reading game and we spent more time trying to count the dang pop I couldn't do it we had to put it away well let's be a reminder to you that the lack of patience is not a reason not to homes because none of us are saints and none of us have that much patience we just get really good at switching tasks we don't lose it but usually I'm stopping a lesson to switch to a game not the other way around there's always a first for everything but besides that moment we had another productive day it was a math geography and Bible day so it was a really hands on day and we got to end it with homemade banana bread and quiet reading time
