I am 32 weeks pregnant and I am in furious nesting mode. I feel like I cannot get everything done in time for the baby to get here. So let's nest together. These are all of my out of season clothes. Closet in the bedroom is like jam packed with in season clothes. These are my out of season clothes, haha.
