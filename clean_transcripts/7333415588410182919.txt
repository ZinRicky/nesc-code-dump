um in the park in Melbourne was murdered I could go on and on about it that too many boyfriends like all these things to me it's just like um capsicum spray I've got to do all these things twice me twice this should be in the training in the RSA and liquor licencing laws etcetera that we have to do why were you wearing that I just think firstly and it's a survivor driven I have to make sure I've got my tracking app cause you're responsible for it um it's a responsive all of that just so that I can maybe have a chance um I mean that's just the I have to not leave the house after dark it's like the green washing of sexual assault industry you need to have your wits about you why weren't you carrying your rap whistle survivors having to like buy drink caps to put over their drinks then it becomes what's next creating these products oh you got the okay doesn't pass the vibe cheque I have to um um drink spiking caps aren't you a slutty woman why am I the one who then has to go and make these purchases you gotta be the perfect victim as a woman you know tracking apps I have to make sure that I don't wear revealing clothing I have had my drink spiked twice in my life you need to be careful people say happens and it doesn't actually happen or as potential victim survivors or as a women or queer people it's like it's not my fault that climate change is happening because if something does happen um but yeah our data or make sure I meet in a public place are you gonna be blamed for it so you can find it all online I have to wear makeup and not too much makeup so when I see more products designed to keep us safe this mining company isn't shit um not just about victim scrunchie um when a single man have never been reprimanded when this gas company isn't doing shit blah blah blah blah blah in court so if we have this like ever it's just this thing that you know um and I think that we need to be having a conversation it's not a preventative actual rape whistles make sure that I don't go back to someone's house it's like when who was it need to purchase with your money to fix this problem just so that everyone like one in 10 everyone who reported incidents at festivals skanky on social media I have to only drink three drinks the kind of like tip of the iceberg really I have to make sure I've got my rate whistle was it Eurydice Dixon just another thing like like talk about it that much anymore or think about it that much anymore and we found that of the festivals um because we wanted to ensure that we kind of lifted the veil on the data and also to give really practical steps for prevention um and so this is um why were you drunk I have to not post anything too um never ending kind of list of things that we have to do as victim survivors women need to be more careful I have to you know so why do I need to buy all these things to show that I'm sustainable she's a crowd why don't you do that 8% of those incidents involved drugging and drink spiking remember to use these objects when it plays out in my head you gotta be the perfect victim and even then it's hard of preventing this thing happening to me and like I just feel like it's one of those things where we don't even the thing for me is oh for prevention staffing to be trained to recognise drink spiking not a single man that spiked my drink or sexually assaulted me rather than fix this problem it's like a band aid like the monster myth and showed what survivors actually experienced in the night time economy has ever been reprimanded by the law or in any other way not have too many boyfriends it's like here's a product that you as an individual consumer I'll put in the link so for me what it's like the same it's like I live in a patriarchy digital rape whistles I am vulnerable venues should have to get accreditation around it survivor LED report by my company this is obviously absolutely disgusting and gross that uh around 50% of those incidents involve sexual assault why didn't you cover your drink if I forget to use the product or don't buy the product can say why did you go to his house I've got to make sure I've got my little drink we release Safe Spaces report around the Safe Spaces Summer campaign not just about by standard awareness and looking out for it it's just blown up in the media it's just not really the vibe so all of these things it's like and the police came out and said well and it could almost be one of those things that you think oh I think okay why didn't you keep yourself safe and yet I'm out here having to buy these products to keep myself safe um we found that it was very much prevalent and um we just released a report called Gender Safety in the Night Time Economy
