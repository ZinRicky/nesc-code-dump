I want better for us. I don't want hating your body to be one of the most universal experiences for women. This woman has lived a full life, and yet one of her biggest fears is looking at her body, seeing the number on the scale. This is why I continuously talk about unlearning your fatphobia. Because you don't wanna wake up when you're 70 and hate your body. Still hating your body. Nobody deserves that. This woman deserves to love herself and her body. She got to grow old. Do you understand what a privilege it is to grow old and yet to get to an old age and still feel like you're a stranger in your body, still feeling uncomfortable when you look at yourself? So many people will never understand the peace that comes with just being content in your own skin. And that is literally all I ever want for any of us. Because one day you will wake up and your life will have passed you by, and you will still wake up unhappy with yourself and unhappy with your body. We are consistently being marketed to, being told that we need to hate ourselves, hate our bodies, hate our size, become small. And unless you take active action, unless you take a moment to look at your body and just become comfortable to accept it, unless you do that, you will always be at odds with yourself. You will always be fighting yourself. Life Is difficult enough. You at least deserve to feel peace when you look at the mirror
