I would never normally post this, because so many people are going through a natural disaster right now, I just wanna remind you that we don't need comments like this. Just because your reality doesn't match someone else's doesn't mean it didn't happen. And so here is your reminder that if you have nothing nice to say, just keep scrolling. We don't need to comment things like this because it could be someone's worst nightmare.
