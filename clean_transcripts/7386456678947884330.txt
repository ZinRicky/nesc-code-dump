do people understand the likelihood of a national abortion ban in the next few years like even if Republicans don't control Congress there's a few different ways that this could play out let me explain first thing they're gonna try to use is the Comstock Act The Comstock Act is a law from the 1800s that prohibited you from mailing obscene matter including contraception and any tools that could be used to procure an abortion The Comstock act was the product of this weirdo narc named Anthony Comstock who was obsessed with trying to eradicate corn birth control and abortion throughout the United States we've really come full circle here cause that's also kind of the modern day Republican Party see the Comstock Act just kind of like floated into oblivion where it belongs it was never actually repealed so it's a law that's still on the books in the United States Republicans are currently trying to revive the Comstock Act particularly in the mifepristone litigation where they are arguing that abortion pills can't be sent through the mail because it's prohibited under the Comstock Act this is just the starting point for conservatives who are trying to find a court that will hold that this 150 year old law can be used to prohibit abortion pills today and that the law is constitutional given uphill battle because the law is pretty clearly unconstitutionally vague it bans sending any obscene matter through the US Postal Service which doesn't really give citizens any idea of what is and is not prohibited under the act but I've seen some really wild opinions by Trump appointed judges so you can really never be sure at this point If they succeed at finding a court that will rely on the Comstock Act they're gonna go in after birth control under the act and then they're going to try to eradicate abortion nationwide by relying on the act's provision that it prohibits any tools that are being sent through the mail to procure an abortion so they'll just try to start banning a bunch of medical tools remember this is a law that's already on the book so if Trump wins he wouldn't necessarily need Congress to help him affectuate this plan second thing they're gonna try to do is argue that the FDA and other federal agencies screwed up when they approved medication abortion and abortion procedures and it's actually just really unsafe for women and we're just really looking out for women to go watch my video on the Chevron doctrine to fully understand the intricacies of how this one will play out but basically earlier this week the Supreme Court gave a green light for courts to second guess federal agencies like the FDA so just as in the mifipristone litigation plaintiffs are arguing that look the FDA screwed up when it approved mifipristone a commonly used unsafe abortion medication which is safer than penicillin tylenol and Viagra and they're trying to find anti choice extremist judges to be like yeah I am wiser than the FDA the expert scientists and doctors at the FDA and I will second guess them and take mifepristone off the market if they succeed at that they'll try to start doing that for methods of birth control and other methods of procuring an abortion and the last option is that Republicans are just going to try to pass a national abortion ban depending on how much control they have of Congress and the presidency this whole idea like let's just leave it to the states yeah um they are lying to you they absolutely want a national abortion ban so yeah um not to scare everybody but this is the practical reality that we need to understand and plan for and fight against and I think a lot of people who live in blue states feel pretty safe like they don't feel like an abortion ban is gonna come to them but as I just explained there's multiple avenues that it may come to you and they're actively trying to affectuate them like yesterday this is everything I just described is already happening
