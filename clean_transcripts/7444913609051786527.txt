I screwed up last night I have really anxiety with me up in the middle of the night sometimes and then I get the doom loop going so I can go back to sleep and I use an audiobook to tune out my own thoughts and put myself back to sleep but last night I didn't have an audiobook prepared and so I at 3:00am just picked a book used an audible credit turns out it was a hockey romance if you read hockey romances you probably know where this is going it was a little too strong little too spicy for my 3:00am need to go back to sleep self mm hmm I'm awake now and I'm still uncomfortable about it I used an audible credit now what do I do
