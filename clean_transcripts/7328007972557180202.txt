okay I wanna use this comment as an opportunity to call in my fellow white people and again you don't have to consider me white cause I am Jewish but that's a whole another racial ethnic conversation because it's very easy to have blinders on and not consider yourself racist but have underlying racial bias and I'm saying that as somebody who wasn't always this socially aware or conscious or considerate not because I was a bad person but because I simply like didn't see the problem which is where I think a lot of this colored people stand why do you have to make everything about race why are you causing division what's the problem with a white woman being successful so let's talk about it for a second okay and I'm gonna say this in like a very kind and empathetic way because you don't know what you don't know and you can't do better until you know better um there's nothing wrong with a white person having a large account being successful etc but the fact that it is overwhelmingly a majority of accounts that are successful that are white and skinny and CIS het etc that is what's worth criticizing because you don't think there's enough black consumers of media to make a black woman the next ballerina farms the reason why that isn't the case is because of algorithms on platforms like TikTok and Instagram that are inherently racially biased there are far more people of color than there are white people okay let's let's just set that together but when it comes to media white faces are overwhelmingly the ones that are highlighted the ones that you see just look at the Oscars and you would never question it if you're also white because it's this reality of being the standard that you live within and it's not until you take a critical look at the why why is it mostly white people that you realize that there's a certain demographic of people that are being purposefully and methodically cut out of levels of success and influence I agree that people wanna follow people that remind them of a better version of themselves but that privilege should also extend to people in brown bodies in larger bodies in disabled bodies there's more of them then there are her paths they should be able to look to their black queen homesteader housewife luxury travel influencer style and beauty guru who is doing as well because there is a large enough market to support it and of course there are successful accounts that fall under those categories but not as many honestly black women have been saying this Latino women have been saying this brown women across social media have been saying this but the fact that I know that more people are willing to listen to me explain it then them makes the point
