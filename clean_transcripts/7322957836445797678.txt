this is gonna be controversial but if he wanted to he would isn't the feminist mantra that it claims to be sure if someone is passing it's encouraging women to leave relationships with inadequate men because men are hunters or whatever and so when they want something they go for it and so if they're not doing that with you it means that they don't want you well that might be true for some men it's not true for most men half of men are not securely attached just like women um which means that intimacy might be something that they want but not something that they have the capacity or the natural ability to practice men just like women are complex creatures and assuming that they operate based on a totally different human paradigm based on the fact that they like hunted Tiger Sabre tooth tigers 12,000 years ago is absurd is absurd but it doesn't just reduce men it disempowers women and actually makes women responsible for bad male behaviour it takes all of the reasons that you know a man might be acting the way that he is acting and putting it entirely on the woman as the reason that he's doing it actually reinforces the very codependent tendency that it's trying to you know make up for or repair by making the woman completely internalized and personalized male behaviour if he wanted to he would implies that if a woman was different her treatment would be different it implies that a woman is responsible for the way that a man treats her and that somehow the way that he treats her his his his actions are reflective of her value when we know that the way that a man treats a woman is always a reflection of how he treats himself that was the entire thesis of my book full of men um right I was so sick of of of hearing feminists and and women saying you know men hate women when men don't hate women their sexism reveals a deep hatred of themselves bad communication is assuming that you already know it's signing intentions to someone's behavior which is exactly what his expression does I get why we have expressions like that it gives us a sense of control right in a situation where you might be confused about someone's behavior to just say well I'm I know his intention I know why he's you know all of the reasons that explain his behaviour and so it gives us a sense of control it gives us a sense of being able to predict that something's gonna end um and and why it's gonna end we're trying to predict something that's completely unpredictable which is dating and relationships so get off your phone go on some dates don't take shit personally if you wanted to you would
