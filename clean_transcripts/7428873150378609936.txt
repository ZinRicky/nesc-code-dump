if I have to bake another cake anytime soon after this I may as well open a bakery and I feel like if I've said it once I've said it a thousand times but it's birthday season and today we're celebrating a special someone who's turning the big 15 we're going for a fluffy vanilla sponge with a berry coulis centre because their favourite colour is pink I first met them back in 2014 and we've had a lot of really good times together which mainly involved keeping the lights on and I don't know if you've ever tried to play a birthday game with a non physical entity before but musical chairs, pass the parcel and pin the electricity bolt on the mascot were all epic fails so it's a good thing Powershop have given us the birthday games this time the games are surprisingly addictive and there's a bunch of really cool prises up for grabs including free power and you don't even need to be a customer to play just head on over aim for a high score and you could win big
