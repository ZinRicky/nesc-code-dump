I think one of the pieces about the Tradwife content creator conversation that is really important to notice is that a lot of this content speaks to an anti feminism narrative I'm not saying that you can't be a homemaker and be a feminist I myself am but by painting this role of a subservient wife in this like golden rose color glasses way it's almost like the purpose of this type of content is to sell you a golden cage and tell you that freedom was the problem that making women work and go away from their children too early and having workplaces that are inhospitable to families and children and mothers is the fault of feminism and in fact it's the fault of a patriarchal society that never made true room for women a place of equity for women would be where our lives and livelihoods would not be affected by having children that choosing to stay home and be a homemaker would be just as valid of a career choice as going back to work with the same sorts of consequences financially and since we're not there yet so instead of having the conversation of how we get there we're being sold at a time where we had lack of choice was better
