so on all my videos about being a cycle breaking parent or a respectful parent there inevitably are comments from people who say well I don't know about you but my kids are scared of me and they act right or I got time out and I got beaten and I turned out just fine so here's my parenting hot take there are three general routes you can take with your style of parenting the easiest is permissive parenting you just ignore your child's bad behavior and make it everybody else's problem the second easiest in my opinion is authoritarian parenting because it is effective because if you threaten someone with physical violence they will a lot of the times submit to your rule that doesn't work for everyone however because there are types of people who would rather watch the world burn than submit to authoritarian methods and then the third and the most hard is gentle or respectful parenting however that is the most psychologically sound for the child being brought up now permissive parenting gets mistaken for gentle parenting all the time and I would agree a lack of boundaries and structure is not great for kids but the people who believe in authoritarian parenting that beating your kid or threatening them with time out to tell them to suck it up and stop crying is gonna somehow produce a better generation of people I would like to remind them that there are criminals and crazy people and bad eggs and absolutely average every generation including the generations who got their asses beat and I'm truly of the belief that you cannot beat the bad out of someone but you can absolutely beat the bad into somebody so although we do not threaten our kids with their physical safety I can assure you that they still can follow boundaries rules and are fabulous members of society because in my opinion if you threaten to spank your kid you're taking the easy way out
