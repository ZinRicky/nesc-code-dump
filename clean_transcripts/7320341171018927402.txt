This has been my favorite late night snack lately. It's actually past midnight. It's 12:43 and I was craving this so bad. It's just whipped cream with blackberries and raspberries on top. And some coconut sugar. I usually like homemade whipped cream, but you can do whatever. And the sugar on top is so good cause it's so crunchy. Yes! I grew up eating this and I forgot about it. I haven't had it in years. It's so yummy. Look at that.
