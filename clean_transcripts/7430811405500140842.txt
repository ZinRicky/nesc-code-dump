So, for everyone who saw my post, um, or has been on my page at all, knows that I highly recommend this book. Sorry. Uh, this book, it has helped me, and actually every female member of my family immensely. But did you know that there's a second book that is a guided journal to help you heal? Um, I just got this. I'm pretty sure it's going to ruin my day, but work is hard, you know? I'm gonna link the guided journal on this post, but I also have the original book in my Linktree in my Amazon storefront, because I recommend it to literally everyone.
