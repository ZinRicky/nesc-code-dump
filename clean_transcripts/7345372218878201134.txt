Hello. About to make lunch. I'm cooking up some black beans. Beans just in general always kind of give me a stomachache. I soaked overnight, and then I'm rinsing them every day until they got a little stem on them. If they're sprouted, and they're much easier to digest. Let's do this at the beach. I'm late. I am, too. I think it wasn't worth it.
