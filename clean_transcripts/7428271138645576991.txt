I got this cozy sweater on the TikTok shop. It's linked right here. And as someone who lives in Colorado, I highly recommend this sweater. Also love it. As a mom, this is truly like a blanket. If you're going out with your kids and it's like a festival or something, like a fall festival or like anything that you're going out to do, you know you're gonna have little ones in a stroller and you're like, fuck, I don't wanna pack too much but not have enough. This sweater could be like a sweater, a little blanket for them and their stroller. Like this thing is highly recommend.
