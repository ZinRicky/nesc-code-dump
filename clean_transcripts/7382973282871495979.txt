I gave some advice as a mom of three to a friendly acquaintance last night who had just had her second baby and I thought that somebody else might need to hear it we were having a conversation and she was talking about how she was doing she had just welcomed her second son not too long ago and you know how you can tell that somebody's like telling you that they're struggling but they're not telling you in like those words they're just asking the right kind of questions like how did you do it like does it get easier um you know we've been coping like those sorts of kind of like veiled language so I could tell like she was having a hard time and specifically this is another person who does content like specifically like super creative like aesthetic beautiful content that obviously takes a lot of her time and editing and and energy and I told her that it's just hard I think so often we try to pretend that everything is gonna be sunshine and rainbows and like we've got this mama you superhero what yeah go girl but in reality when someone struggling all they wanna know is that like it's okay that they're struggling so I basically just told her I was like it is this hard it's super fucking hard this is the chapter of hard um but it's a temporary chapter and it does get easier and you'll get through it and if you need to take a step back from things that are draining your energy or resources or time think that's okay because you're now in a different chapter it doesn't mean you're always gonna be here but I think the best advice you can give to a new mom who either has one kid or two kids or is going through that transition and is having a tough time is you're having a tough time because it is tough and the more you can like settle into the knowledge that it is hard and you're gonna struggle and and it it's okay it's it's okay to be having a hard time when when something's hard you have to like surrender to the chapter that you're in and look to your friends who have been through it because we're testaments to the fact that you're gonna make it through it too
