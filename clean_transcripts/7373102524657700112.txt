this room has put the pain in painting but because I put the mental in mental health and I don't know how to stop when I'm fixated on something so far I've tried five different colours first it was the mustard limoncello combination which actually sounds kinda delicious then we tried a soft terracotta then I gave up and we painted everything white before I tried again and thought maybe we'd go tonal with a deep brown a lot of people have commented telling me the orange wood is ugly and I just need to white wash it and a previous version of me might have to be honest but I actually like it! it's super retro has tons of character and it feels like the heart and soul of the home so I'm gonna challenge myself to make it work so I found some inspiration put together a mood board cause by the way that stone sample is actually gonna be my fireplace surrounds one day and filled with blind confidence cause you know I'm a big fan of positively gaslighting yourself I took off to Dulux and this might make you shake your head but I didn't even sample it I just fkn committed which is probably you know the sort of behaviour that got me into this situation in the first place but what even is life unless it's slightly spicy plus I had a really good feeling that this colour was gonna be the colour never mind the fact that I also had that feeling over the other five colours if you don't already know one thing you should know about this room is it's actually two rooms in one and one half a half that you can't see gets a shit ton of natural light and this half doesnâ€™t so I needed to find a blue that was blue enough that you could tell it was blue but dark enough that it was still Moody but not too dark that it just looks black you know and if you've watched any of my other renovation content you will know I'm a big fan of a deep green and a lot of people suggested painting this room green too and you're right it would look lovely especially with that orange wood But the room directly off this one is my dining room and I've already painted that one green and as much as I love green I don't want every room to be green do you know what I mean K not a word of a lie this next part had me sweating cause as much as I love the heritage wood I don't love it everywhere and there is a lot in the house so I got rid of some of it But it made this other half look more like a feature wall which I love up next we're cleaning this room within an inch of its life so come back for the update
