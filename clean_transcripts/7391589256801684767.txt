join us for a pool day at the property and a little house update a few years ago my in laws bought some property on the outskirts of town for all of us to live we lived in an RV there for 4 years while we saved her house and my husband built up his company just a few months ago we moved into a rental because I could not take it anymore my physical and mental health were going downhill fast in the RV anyway now for our house we spent all of last year dreaming planning designing our custom home we had everything planned and ready to go to start in January but unfortunately we have been stuck in permitting for the last seven months and that is where we still are stuck in permitting the amount of people who did not do their job correctly has been insane we thought by this point we would be getting ready to move into our dream home instead we still haven't started so whatever the reasons are for the delay I'm trusting in the lord's timing and know that it's going to happen when it's meant to happen
