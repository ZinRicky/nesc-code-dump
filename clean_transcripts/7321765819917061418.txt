to add some context to the previous video I made about not really yelling at my kids um I would like to inform all of you that I am an ADHD neurodivergent parent spoken on here about having sensory processing issues I have had ADHD diagnosis since I was in third grade and I currently have a third grader who also has sensory processing disorder in some ways having ADHD I think makes me a better parent for a child who has sensory processing issues because I remember the feeling of wanting to claw my own skin off if something didn't feel right and then the follow up video to that video I did explain that I have absolutely lost my shit on my kids I also had a large part of my parenting experience where I was suffering from postpartum anxiety which can absolutely trigger things like rage and control this hasn't been an easy journey for me but I post about it because I'm proud of myself and because this hasn't been an overnight journey this isn't something that comes naturally or easy to me some of the best respectful parenting creators on this app are Neurodivergent ADHD and autistic I'll tag them below
