yesterday I made a video about how I got a Zillow notification that property I had my eye on decrease his price sent to my husband convinced him that we should buy instead of building our dream home long story short he sent it to our realtor and it is in fact still like 100 k overpriced and he absolutely will not be moving into a 28 year old mobile home however there is a but he didn't say no he said he would not be purchasing it but I could purchase it with my own money I'm unemployed in fact I have a full time job that I do not get paid for am I delusion enough to believe I can make 900 k on TikTok maybe do you need to start dancing to bring in that cash cause it will maybe it could happen right
