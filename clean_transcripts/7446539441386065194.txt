I can't explain why, but every time December rolls around I start craving pavlovas. Baked them multiple times all throughout the month, but today it's my first. I start by whipping my egg whites until soft peaks form before gradually adding in my sugar. Once that all looks glossy, I add in my vanilla paste and let that go for another minute. This point I add in my cream of tartar and some cornstarch before folding that all in and transferring that over to a baking sheet. Make sure there's a good dip in the middle, and then put it in the oven at 3:50, but then immediately turn the heat down to 200. Let that bake for about an hour and a half while I get started on my cherry compote. While that's reducing, I make a quick whipped cream by combining some heavy cream, vanilla, and powdered sugar. Once that's all ready to go, I take out my cooled pavlova, spread the heavy cream on top and the cherry compote as well. I love a good orange zest in my cherry compote. Garnish it with some Rosemary and there we go!
