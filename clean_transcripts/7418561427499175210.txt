do a homeschool math lesson with us my kids are 8 and 6 and I do math and reading on different days so we can spend more time focusing on one subject so if you watch this and think dang that math lesson must have been an hour you would be right this activity included number line based 10 and place value I started with a blank number line I put a number in the 10 somewhere on the number line and they had to skip count forward and backwards by 10 to film the rest and then I would say something like this find the 60 and count backwards by seven you have to tell me that the number is 53 and then make it with number tiles and then show me the number with your base 10 block and then we do this over and over again counting forwards and backwards this is building a foundation for a lot of different math concept like running to the nearest whole number in two digit addition and subtraction so even though this might be easy for your child you wanna make sure you're giving them lots of exposure because you want it to still be easy when they're using it for harder skills my motto is practice until it's annoying that's when I know they're ready to do it on their after the numberline activity we worked on place value I really had no intention of doing this part but the kids wanted to and I just went with so they would build and read these numbers and then I would ask questions like what numbers in the 10th place or what place value is the 9 in and then I would repeat ones tens hundreds thousands we also talked about when we read a number we read from left to right but when we're doing additional subtraction we always start at the right in the ones place which is so confusing for kids
