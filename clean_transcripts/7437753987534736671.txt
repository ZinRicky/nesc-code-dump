Look at this super cute bodysuit. I haven't tried it on yet, but I understand why Poppy Lush is so popular. This is super thick, and the snaps are super strong. Like, you know, sometimes you wear a bodysuit, and then you can feel that shit unbutton, like in your little lamps. This one is not gonna come undone, so I get it. I get it. Stay tuned to see it on. It does have the cups. Oh, they're removable, so I really like cups, but I think they might help with this. Okay. Stay tuned to see me try it on. I will eventually. I just have to post this, like, right now.
