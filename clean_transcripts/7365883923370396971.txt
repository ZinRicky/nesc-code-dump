When did it become a man's responsibility to buy you anything in the dating phase? expect men to give them gifts take them out on expensive dates during the dating phase which makes absolute no sense a man is not responsible for buying you gifts or paying your bills if you're only dating you’re not his woman When you expect these things as a woman then you're dating for convoluted reasons men have responsibilities and bills too When dating someone it should really only ever be about if you like the person if you connect with them Not about how much of his money he can spend on you what he can give you it's about compatibility Mutual likeness, do you share the same values, do you have the same beliefs that's what dating should be about They say, @he needs to prove that he can afford me” NO. He doesn't. if you can't even afford yourself then why should he if you can't afford the way you're living or your lifestyle then maybe you should reconsider the way you're living Instead ask yourself are we able to connect, build together do we share the same values and beliefs? A real man takes care of a woman that is his woman Allow Men to give to you (without expecting it) If you expect it, than any man should(WILL) run for the hills You need to build a connection with them and earn their love then if you're lucky enough he will spoil you
