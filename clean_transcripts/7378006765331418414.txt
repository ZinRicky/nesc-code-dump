guess what I did tonight I went on a date we went to a concert and guess how many children I have four guess what I'm divorced and now I'm a single mom that means I take care of my children by myself that has nothing to do with who I sleep with or things I do in my private time I'm a single mom in that I singularly take care of all four of them children and I still have a happy life so this is just a reminder that you do not need to stay with somebody just because you had children with them you can leave you can find happiness and any man that tells you someone isn't gonna love you because you have children that's the kind of man that should have never become a father in the first place and wanted nothing to do with children in the first place because there are very normal men in this world who understand children are a part of life and now who cares we're all about that age that maybe kids are gonna be a deal like part of the deal so just make sure that you're happy
