Welcome to an episode of what my kids didn't eat in their Lunch Box. Because I see so many people saying what my kids eat in a day, but the real truth of it is what my kids didn't eat because my kids don't eat. So I just pack lunches for no reason, don't I? We've got shit. Okay, on her sandwich, we've got whole packet of these uneaten course. She actually ate her yoghurt today, some ham and cheese little pieces and two Oreos. So not bad. Yeah. So can we start being a little bit more honest with these what my kids eat in a day? Because be honest, your kids don't eat cause mine don't and I know yours don't either.
