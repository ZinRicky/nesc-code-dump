Me and Sharkboy have something to show you. I found this little set of eight trucks on the TikTok shop. And my shark loving, truck loving boy loves them. So can you tell us what they are? Mixer. Dump truck. Dump truck. Forklift. Crane. Accelerator. Uh, do you like to play with these? Yeah. Do you think other little kids would like to play with them too? Should they get some? Yeah. Yeah.
