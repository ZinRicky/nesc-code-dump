something that I did last year that I'm so excited to do again this year is learning journals Learning Journal is basically a place where you store all of the things you studied in one subject for the whole school year I primarily use these for science and history for a few reasons one because we do a ton of family style learning and this is a way that I can differentiate the activities for my kids because they are different ages and different levels other reason it is a great way to show academic progress because it is a place to store everything from the beginning of the school year till the end of the school year probably my most favorite reason is cause then I don't have to store loose leaf papers the entire school year I can just them right in here and I have everything saved so if you're gonna be doing any kind of family style learning with multiple ages I highly recommend you do some kind of learning journaling or notebooking
