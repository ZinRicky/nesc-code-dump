welcome back to fatties in film! I just watched this today I literally stumbled across literally love this is from the 80s with Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr I was just scrolling Tubi (underrated platform!!) and I came across it by chance this is such a cool like fat revenge movie like yes it is from the 80s so there definitely is like fat phobia for sure it is definitely white feministity but again for the time this is really cool basically Roseanne Barr's character and this guy are married Meryl Streep’s character is a romance novelist and the husband and wife are at his work party and she runs into Meryl Streep at the party and she spills her wine on her which introduces the two of them and they very quickly start an affair and at first like he's gaslighting her he's like I'm not cheating on you what do you mean da da da it’s professional like obviously she knows because he's not coming home at night so obviously she's upset eventually he leaves her goes to live with Meryl Streep does she crawl up into little pool of despair pity and sadness no she gets to work you know mean girls how Janice has like a list of things a list of things that she need to do to ruin Regina George that's basically what she does to her ex he says what's important to him is his home his family his job blah blah things like one by one she gets her sweet revenge she also has a glow up throughout the movie that does not consist at all of weight loss and I love that in the beginning of the movie her hair is frizzy she has a mole her makeup's not great her outfit's not good and we see as movie goes on she like starts doing things putting effort in her appearance and she has a glow up that has nothing to do with weight loss so that was really impressive for the 80 but yeah she gets her revenge on Meryl and the husband and it is a phenomenal fat film I would say that this is the invert of the movie Sugar Baby or ZukarBaby I prefer the German version but basically about a plus size woman who makes a ploy to like get this man into her and it is so beautifully shot I love the movie I made a video about it at some point early I think these two movies back to back would be a really good double feature or if you wanna watch this plus another fat revenge film I would watch piggy and that is like a fat slasher movie it’s a bit gory so I don't even know how much I can show of the poster but it's like a fat slasher thing very good and this was ZuckerBaby a German movie from the 80s I believe honestly the story is a good like you're so much more about how beautifully shot this was like this is such a beautiful image of a fat woman it just shot so like phenomenally with the such amazing lighting and set design also highly recommend but either would be a phenomenal double feature with she-devil anyway randomly stumbled upon this movie and I'm so glad cause I loved it
