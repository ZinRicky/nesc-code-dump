at Christmas time nothing screams I've got my life together quite like the smell of freshly baked gingerbread cookies and you and I both know that I'm barely hanging on by a thread but the people that are about to arrive at my house must never find out so instead today we're gonna work a little bit of Christmas magic with the Circa holiday range and I fell in love with this range last Christmas they've got three beautiful scents to choose from and the obvious choice for today is the gingerbread cookies it's a warm and inviting scent of ginger cosy cinnamon and a sweet mix of brown sugar and vanilla and hopefully it convinces everyone that I totally just made this gingerbread house from scratch top it with icing sugar to hide any sins and if anyone asks I was definitely going for rustic ok is it pretty? debateable but is it edible? also debateable but does my house smell like Martha Stewart's kitchen on Christmas morning? pretty sure it does before Snoop gets there at least I added some Circa minis which would make super cute festive favours and now I cosplay as somebody who definitely has time to make gingerbread houses from scratch
