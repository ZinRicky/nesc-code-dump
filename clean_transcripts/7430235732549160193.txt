the turn of events that happens this afternoon was not on any of my bingo cards but for right now I'm blissfully unaware of the minor inconvenience that awaits me I got up this morning at sparrows headed to the airport and flew to Australia for one night and one night only and I will never not be grateful for experiences like this was absolutely blown away when L'oreal Paris reached out and invited me to come and I don't know who needs to hear this but make those silly little TikToks girl cause you never know what might happen don't mind the chocolate on my top apparently even if I'm away from the children I'm still a hot fkn mess so I made it into my hotel room found some goodies and opened up my bag cause I wanted to find my swimsuit to go hang out with some of the girls at the pool and it was pretty hard to not notice the fact that my bag had completely shit itself Itâ€™s actually a wonder I didn't lose anything cause there was literally a gaping hole in my bag and once I unzipped it there was no way I was gonna be able to zip it back up again which is a bit of an issue cause we're leaving first thing in the morning but a quick Google search told me that this brand have a lifetime warranty on their bags so I jumped in an Uber with my broken bag lugged it through Sydney found the shop and they were so incredible they just replaced it on the spot and even though it was kind of annoying I was honestly just laughing the entire time because this is exactly the sort of shit that happens to me I'm not even surprised by the universe anymore but also I did need to pick myself up a bottle of wine because I was fizzing at that point and then I had to really hustle to get ready because all of that made me extremely late
