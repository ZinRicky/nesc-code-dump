I feel like I owe the whole entire nation of Fiji an apology I'm gonna cry I feel so bad little old me when I was 21 years old I went on a mission trip to Fiji I was like a devout Christian I mean like devout Christian this is my whole life Nandi to to proselytize and to convert them and and to let the people of Fiji know that they should be Christians and not you know whatever their their culture would have them to believe they did like they invited us into their their villages and the the children performed for us the pastor had us in his house for dinner I just wanna show like stranger spaces but they had us in their house there's the flag they had us in their house and like welcomed us with open I mean the food was delicious okay look another one the kids performing for us I got stuck in the rain with a woman and we had to like walk home this is like the most magical trip I went snort like I was like okay I remember even asking the pastor like this kind of feels like a fucking vacation because I'm having a great time uh you know what are we doing and he was like well we're gonna have to you know build it into the trip or whatever cause I since I'm a pastor this is the only way I really get vacations and so you know we just build it in but we're definitely working and I was like okay thing is we did actually work what we did go places and like try to convert people and tell them they should be Christian and we had like a little Christian pastor there that like the Jesus Bible based Christian and I remember one day we went into this like little square and these Fijian men were these men were dressed in their regalia for a ceremony like a really cool one and they had the leaves around their ankles and around their wrist and it was like stunning I was taking aback at how fucking cool it was to be like on their island and they're wearing their their stuff and they're getting ready to perform I felt like so honoured to be there cause we had been already a part of like a few little things and all the people I were with were like oh no that's evil we don't wanna support that like we're here to convert them and I was like oh oh like it click and I was like oh I guess you can't believe in that and this at the same time and I got it but that kind of sunk heavy in my heart and like to this day it's been 20 years 20 years 20 years I feel like I owe the whole entire nation of Fiji an apology for coming onto your beautiful island and trying to tell your people that your beautiful customs brought to tears because it's so beautiful your culture is so rich and amazing and like no one has a right to like come to your place and be like you're wrong for doing like your ancestral shit so just in case TikTok ever gets shut down and I never get the chance to make it back to Fiji I genuinely feel like I owe Fiji an apology so I hope your culture is bright is as bright and thriving as it's ever been and it is such an amazing magical place to this damn like I drink Fiji Water to be like yeah it's a Fiji it was beautiful so
