female founders are built different I'm Doctor Zoe I have a PhD in digital feminist activism I'm the founder of she's a crowd and I'm the director of raise the crowd we support female founders and diversity founders to achieve their business goals and dreams and grow organically and sustainably I'm gonna tell you the biggest mistake that I see female founders make when embarking on their businesses and when I coach them how I coach them away from making a mistake let's say for example you love smut and you wanna create a online store just for smut and it's like maybe a little bookstore as well maybe a little shopfront so you go out you build your website you buy all your stock you develop the business idea and the brand and then no one comes no one buys your books or let's say you've got the idea to develop Uber for cats you think it's a really good idea you think that cats really need Ubers to get from a to B better and you go out and you spend $100,000 building an app with all these different features for cats to use it and then no cats even wanna take Ubers who would have thought so the mistake you've made is not testing your biggest Assumption so people go and spend a lot of time and a lot of money building businesses that no one comes to they have forgotten to test whether or not the build business will work they've forgotten to get to know their audience and they haven't been able to grow organically as a result so in this case the big Assumption would be that cats need to get from a to B so you need to go and test that Assumption the second big Assumption would be they're not happy getting from a to B in the way that they currently do so you need to go test that Assumption then you need to test whether cats can physically use an app and if they would wanna pay to get from a to B so you need to find a way to go and test that Assumption for the smart library example you are assuming that women wanna read smart we know that they do you're assuming that they would then buy it from an independent seller and potentially pay a little bit more money to get it all in one place so you need to find the cheapest and easiest way to test your biggest Assumption and when you build that that's called the MVP the minimum viable product so you might build an Instagram and just start posting the things um that your business is all about and the type of brand and vibe and see how many followers you you might build a landing page with email addresses to collect and see how many email addresses you collect of people who wanna be on the waiting list for your first products you need to figure out who are my people and will they come and will they pay for it what is some low barrier ways that you can find that out now I obviously can't go into too much detail here cause I don't have time but this is the type of thing I flesh out with each of my clients when I'm doing business coaching with them how can we test the biggest Assumption you've made in building a business as early and as cheaply and as quickly and as easily as possible because if we find that actually cats don't really need Ubers and wouldn't pay for Ubers and can't use Ubers then we might decide that maybe we need to pivot and change before we waste a whole bunch of everyone's time and money trying to make Uber for cats so the idea is you are being lean it's the lean startup model you are testing often you are failing fast you're not building the whole thing with all the bells and whistles all the features all the fancy things you're building a Google form and you're asking people what they want and if they'd pay for it you're building a landing page and collecting email addresses you're validating quickly and failing quickly too that way when you do find the successful thing you build that little bit of it you test from there you grow from there you grow your audience along the way as you go and then you build the next little bit and then you you know you release one product at a time or you release to one little part of the market at a time you just build incrementally as you go you are responding to your audience rather than assuming that you know already all the little fancy things that you think that they'll want and then you waste all the time of money building something that no one wants for an audience you don't have cause I'm really passionate about making sure that diverse founders are thriving and can solve all the diverse problems we have in the world no more Mark Zuckerberg clones no more gatekeeping the industry this is what we're all about so if you're interested if you got a side hustle if you've got an idea if you wanna grow your business build your business attract funding market better any of it we develop personalized development plans for each founder that we work with and then we support you in really practical and specific ways to get where you need to go from a to B just like a cat in an Uber
