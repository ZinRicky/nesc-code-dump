Have you guys heard of soft guy era or drizzle drizzle it's a new trend or shall I say awakening happening amongst men Where they’re being more in tune with their emotions and I wouldn't say that they're more feminine but rather an adjacent where they now want special treatment too just like all the ladies They got bullied so much by woman that now they're letting go of their toxic masculinity not being aggressive they want soft guy era energy they want all the special treatment that women get they want doors opened for them They wanna be the passenger emperor They wanna be pampered they wanna be spoiled just like any other woman is. So you better be ready better be ready to apologize first pull out chairs for them the whole nine yards because guess what they deserve it and they want it They’re tired of being taken advantage of they want to be spoiled just like all the other women It’s crazy because it's actually working for them I don't think this movement is gonna end what do you think?
