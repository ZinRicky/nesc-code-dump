I was laying in bed about to go to sleep, and all I kept thinking about was this sweet, comforting dessert I used to have growing up called mishrice. Growing up, my German grandma would make this for me all the time. Essentially, it's just a rice pudding. I started by sweating down my rice and some butter, took it off the heat, poured in some milk, pinch of salt, some sugar and vanilla, let that come to a boil, and then simmer for about 35 minutes. In the meantime, I made a quick raspberry compote with some frozen raspberries, squeeze of lemon, and some sugar. After it simmered for a few minutes, I gradually added in my cornstarch slurry, and once it was thick enough, I let it simmer for a couple more minutes before taking it off the heat. One thing that's just an essential is cinnamon sugar on top of mesh rice. So I combined some cinnamon and sugar, plated my rice, sprinkled that on top, and then finished it off with some of my raspberry sauce. I like eating this while it's still piping hot. This was absolutely heavenly and exactly what I needed to go to sleep.
