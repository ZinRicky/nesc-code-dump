My mom. Imagine how I feel. So I always wear my hair up like this, and it's gray as fuck. And my oldest daughter went when Encanto came out. She wasn't at my home. She was a five day visit. I didn't see her, talk to her, nothing. And she watched the movie and she said, oh, Mommy, the mom in the movie is just like you. And I was like, well. And I saw it. Initially I was like, oh. But then she's like, no, listen to what she says, because her. I don't know, it just. I fucking love it. And it fills my heart that she loves me, like.
