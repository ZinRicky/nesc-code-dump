most people look at homeless people and say “oh they're junkies” I honestly hate when people say that because it doesn't make them any less human. I will never stop feeling remorse for people who are struggling Because I know what it's like to struggle I know that could be me or it could be you. hardships hit everyone.. sometimes it genuinely is out of their control or they just lose their path So next time you see a person struggling even if you can't help them financially Help them with a smile, help them with being kind Just treat people how you would like to be treated they're not any less human than you or I
