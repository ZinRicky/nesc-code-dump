my health is my top priority so the way that I pack for three weeks of travel is extremely important so you know I packed organic cotton panties and a basal body thermometer to track my cycle and of course my body lotion and hair care is all natural and then because I have such long and thick hair you know I need a ton of claw clips my organ supplements and Shilajit come with me everywhere along with an herbal coffee alternative laptop chargers obvious along with a drill gun and then for oral care I've got my bamboo toothbrushes and my Akamai tooth powder I can't go anywhere without tallow and my vitamin C serum Gua Sha and natural makeup are obvious must haves as well gelatin powder because I'm psycho and my grounding shoes are essential and I finally got to break out my hiking boot and I had to bring a pickleball duh and a sewing kit just in case
