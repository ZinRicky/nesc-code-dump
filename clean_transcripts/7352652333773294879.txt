it's really frustrating to care about the conversation of sustainability when existing in inherently capitalist society that does not care about the environment constantly like at odds at my you know desire to support the earth and you know understanding of you know climate changing global warming and all that and also fatigue from existing in society knowing that none of the actions that I take will actually matter because of not joking maybe like 100 people like for the rest of my life I will be subjected to straws that disintegrate in my mouth and that will still not outweigh the negative impact of a 30 minute flight that Taylor Swift takes from one end of a state to another and so it just it's it’s it’s frustrating and I'm like why does it matter I can do all the things I can do all the things that you know help the environment and I'm not gonna not do but it just feels so and it just makes it hard for me to care about conversations about sustainability because we're just we're we're doing minute change when we need to get to the root of the issue and I just I just I just feel this doomerism when it comes to sustainability and the conversation about that like literally makes me feel like a boomer but I honestly don't know how to reckon with that either I don't know anyways
