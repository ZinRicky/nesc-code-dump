around here we do not follow a public school calendar so even though our public schools are off this week we are not gonna take off Thursday and Friday and just have a normal beginning of the week I think it's an important time to remind you that you get to homeschool however you want during the holiday you can take time off you can continue homeschooling like normal you can ditch your curriculum and do a holiday themed unit study you can cut back on formal lessons to make time for seasonal activity you are going to be bombarded with a lot of things and ideas this holiday season but you get to choose what works and what is fulfilling to your family
