okay guys it's time to help the helpers I've partnered with Operation Olive Branch to help a family get themselves out of Gaza this is Naim he's been studying to be a doctor in Egypt and got trapped in Gaza when the fighting broke out and has not been able to escape with his family he has been volunteering tirelessly at different hospitals and medical clinics in order to help the injured people all around him including having the insufferable experience of having to treat his family members after an attack this gofundme would help not just him but his parents and siblings the youngest of whom is eight years old knowing that he's there trying to help in any way he can reminds me of that line from Mister Rogers that when terrible things are happening to look at the helpers because that's where you will find hope they're still shy of their goal so I'm hoping that we together can get them out of Gaza so he can go on to finish his medical degree and help more people the link is in my bio y'all know what to do
