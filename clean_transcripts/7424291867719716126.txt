The Hollywood reporter recently wrote an article about tribewives. It was interviewed for the article, and I absolutely love the quote that they chose. I wanted to be the mom I dreamed of instead of the wife he wanted. I was searching my soul into why motherhood, while it was something I had dreamed of since I could think, some might say I was groomed into this life, but that's another story. But why was I not finding the joy that I thought I was supposed to find in motherhood? Why did it seem like so much work? Why was I so tired? Why was I unable to, like, not lose my temper with my kids? why was. Why are two year olds able to get under my skin? You know what I mean? Like, what's going on here that I can't keep my cool? They're my children that I love. What's going on? That I'm so frustrated. I'm waking up at such anxiety and frustration levels. And when I did some soul searching, I realized I'm not able to mother them the way that I want. My focus as a tribe wife is my husband and how to keep him happy. And that means keep the kids quiet. And that means I don't get to mother them and enjoy them the way that I want. I'm looking for ways to escape and to leave the house and to do other things. And so I realized I had To pick. I got to that point. I had to pick my husband or my kids, and I chose my kids. I would rather my kids have the mother that they deserve because I brought them into the world. I owe that to them. Then cling to a failing relationship just because I brought kids into the world with him.
