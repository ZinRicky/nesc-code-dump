a permanent feature on the Mount Pleasant side of the Ravenelle Bridge is the USS Yorktown and me and my little family went there recently for our first trip for a homeschool field day we truly underestimated how much was going to be here the entire ship is a museum including inside and the top deck filled with history and real life war planes there was so much to explore that we became members I also think it has one of the best views in Charleston
