y'all know that I always do a winged liner look every day that I'm getting glammed up I'm doing a black winged liner and I exclusively use KVD Beauty as tattoo liner now they don't know I exist but you know who does know I exist Winky Luxe and they sent me their black eyeliner and I'm really excited to see if this is anywhere as good let's try it out already the applicator is a little bit different it's more like a felt tipped marker which I think could actually work really well moment of truth okay okay very much like a marker I really like the pigment too it is like an inky black oh okay so my big things are always gonna get that swoop right the tip is actually even sharper which is allowed me to get like really detailed I'm gonna have to wait to see what longevity and wear abilities like but this is a really good contender and maybe a new favourite
