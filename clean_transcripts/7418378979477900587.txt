something we do not talk about enough is the colossal scale of male violence men are the majority of perpetrators of nearly every single violent crime by a landslide— murder, SA, stalking, mass shootings —you name it and for some of these were talking like over 90% were committed by men but every year we spend all of our time and energy debating to what extent we should control women we call them murderers for their abortions we threaten them we demonize them and then you consider the fact that every year tens of thousands of these women who are seeking abortions are doing so because they have been a victim of a man's violent crime against her and then we have the audacity to label her murderer to make her take off work and fly to a safe state (and that's if she's lucky) at her own expense and if she can't do that she'll have to risk her health and life performing non consensual reproductive labor for her government it is like the crime just repeating itself the man takes her body and then the government just does the same and this collective focus on women and their abortions and what we should do about it is absolutely deliberate it is a projection of male violence it is gaslighting on a whole another level and it's a way to distract from where the pain and suffering in our communities is actually coming from
