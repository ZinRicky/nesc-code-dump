This has been my new favorite late night snack. I usually do sweet ones, but this is a little bit more savory. I roasted this purple sweet potato, and I love having it with kimchi, so this is what I do. I roasted my sweet potato for about 45 minutes, and then I got it out the oven, peeled it, and I made this kimchi a while ago, so I just been eating out of this big jar, and I love the combination of this sweet potato with savory kimchi, so I usually just take a little bit, I peel my sweet potato, put some kimchi on it, and just snack on this. It's way past my bedtime. I shouldn't even be up. It's past 12 right now, but I just needed a little midnight snack. My favorite pieces of kimchi are the ones that are the leafy ones, not the hard ones. Mm hmm. These are so sweet, they're almost caramelized.
