I cover my head for church and I get asked all the time how I tie my head coverings so today I'm gonna show you three of my favorite head covering styles first one uses a large square scarf as you can see it's pretty big I'm folding it triangular this scarf has a grippy bit so it doesn't slide put it on my head like this I pull the tails around and just tie one knot at the side of my neck and then I adjust the second one uses a small square scarf dry also fold into a triangle put on my head just like the other one and tie in a knot base of my neck super easy Bandana style last one uses a rectangular scarf this is not even a head covering scarf it's just a regular scarf I put it on my head like so and just wrap it around this is a very easy loose style that I do like when I'm walking to church and there you have it my three favorite ways to tie head coverings
