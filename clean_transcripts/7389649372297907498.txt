I’m sitting here realizing that I 100% catfish my husband now hear me out I used to drink I used to party I was a fun girl Also look nothing like how I look now insert a picture of what I used to look like that's me was probably 22 right before I met him Also me here always had a drink in my hand a drink in my hand every chance I got I catfish that man I don't go out I don't party don't drink I would prefer staying home I straight up catfish that man and honestly while I used to be fun and party I don't consider that fun anymore I’ll go out (maybe) for like dinner But no drinks I should probably ask him does he regret his choices
