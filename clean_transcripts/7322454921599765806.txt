some of the most harmful nasty comments I've gotten about mothering have come from other mothers this creator agrees as a working mom she says the worst comment she's gotten about her role as a mother and as a wife have come from stay at home moms shaming her and that's because we all have a little bit of this eternalized ideal of what a perfect mother is supposed to be generally that usually means selfless content and pleasant all the time which when it comes to reality is a pretty impossible standard to reach but both men and women have internalized this martyrdom of mothers and when we feel judged so harshly and in this competition a lot of women can be just as misogynistic as men in their tearing down of other women and especially other mothers like I hate to be a downer but sometimes it seems like the only way to be a perfect mother the only mothers who are perfect are dead ones the martyr because if you stay alive and you do your best someone's gonna tell you that you're doing it wrong and it'll usually be another mother
