this grapist that I went to school with was at this bar that I went to yesterday I was there for a birthday party no one knew who he was I was there with two other people who knew him from college and obviously I did not want to party with this person but absolutely no one would do anything about it so I had to handle it myself I went up to the bartenders and I was like hey there's a grapist here can you get rid of him they're like oh sorry can't do anything about it like yeah I was like but he's he's a grapist like he's a grapist in the bar like the the bar that I would go to the bar that I'm a regular at would never let him be there but I guess that's not the rule at every bar I talked to this other bartender that was there he's like I can't do anything I'm just trying to do my job sorry okay my bad I talked to like a bunch of guys around me they're like it's your word against him can't do anything about it finally I was like okay let me take it on into my own hand he was flirting with this girl I was like by the way you're talking to a rapist I look at him he looks at me he says nothing I walk away they don't budge they don't move I go back he's with his friends I'm like by the way do you know your friends a grapist the friend laughs awesome finally I said to his face I was like why are you here leave after that he finally left the fact that no one no one in that bar was gonna do anything about it makes me insane
