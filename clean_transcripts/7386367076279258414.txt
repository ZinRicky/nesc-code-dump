racist British people are constantly talking about how like brown people are taking over London and I've been here for like two hours and you wanna know who's taking over London not the brown people not the brown immigrants it's literally Americans I've heard more American accents here than I've heard British accents it seems as though we're colonizing them back we are the ones you should be afraid of racist white British people
