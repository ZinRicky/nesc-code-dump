so I'm homeschooling my kids and they started a co op this year which is brand new and completely different for us and although the co op is Monday and Tuesday and they have their own curriculum to supplement with on the other days I wanted to show you guys what I'm going to be supplementing on top of supplementing to make sure that my kids are getting a well rounded education and that they are staying at their level in progressing appropriately so we use the spectrum for language arts phonics and spelling last year I really liked their curriculum so this year we are doing writing spelling and phonics for my fourth grader and then my third grader is gonna be doing fourth grade phonics fourth grade spelling and I'm still waiting for his writing book to come in cause he's gonna do grade 3 in writing I love the who was and what were book series um right now where you're doing the Salem Witch trials I love to keep our unit studies especially with social studies kind of seasonal so we're gonna do Haunted Charleston the Salem Witch Trials and some other fun spooky stuff for the month of October and then we also are gonna be supplementing with art I just found these art therapy workbooks um my kids are actually doing emotional balance so social emotional learning with their co op and I thought this would be a really great way to both practice art and get like emotional communication skills both kids have expressed an interest in architecture we actually found a kit like for kids at the toy store the other day and they were very intrigued so we are gonna be starting a unit on architecture this one is age appropriate for I would say probably like second to fifth grade and we started these financial literacy books uh during the summer when we kind of had a break from our regular curriculum so they really enjoyed that we still are about I say we're about halfway through we've done a good amount of it but we're still gonna be working on these because I do like the completion of our units I know this seems like a lot of work but the co op doesn't actually assign them a ton of work for the Wednesday Thursday Friday days that they are not in person and in my opinion I think they can do more I think it would benefit them to do more and so we will be doing ELA on all three of those days and then they have some of their supplemental classes they do a Spanish immersion class they do math tutoring so I don't teach math at all and then we will also do one of those special subjects architecture financial literacy and social studies and one day a week and art therapy I'm gonna put all the books that I just mentioned in my Amazon storefront again other than the spectrum books these are all brand new to us uh the financial literacy one I can vouch for is great and stay tuned to see how we like the other ones
