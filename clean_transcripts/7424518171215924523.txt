how to get a woman to fall in love with you 101 I'm gonna put it in simple terms it's not very complicated Think of a woman as a feral cat Starting off with number one this should be a no brainer but be nice to her and act like you want her in your life No. 2 buy her food no girl can resist a giant burrito or French fries get her one or both three provide her safety and shelter all a girl really wants is somewhere she can be comfortable and safe at and somewhere she can loaf on a couch you provide her that and that will make her kitty purr.. If you know what I mean No. 4 give her forehead kisses okay this is every woman's kryptonite you do this and you'll have any woman falling in love with you so use with caution okay five which is arguably one of the most important ones okay be playful with her all women love playful banter she'll think you're flirting with her And if she can be playful with you she'll know that you are the one Six okay you don't have to be a huge romantic guy but compliment her every once in a while tell her her hair looks nice tell her makeup looks nice I don't know her outfit just compliment her every once in a while this isn't a deal breaker just make sure you do it occasionally women really are just feral cats so to put it simply you provide us food, water shelter and a little bit of compassion and we are falling head over heels for you. I hope this helps
