I actually thought this was a gym bag when I got it off the TikTok shop. I thought it was gonna be, like, a huge leather duffel bag and I could be, like, super cool. But then I realize it's, like a tiny little purse. But then I kind of like it, as I can be fancy with my purse. I normally have one of those, like, crossbody bags that I wear for all my stuff, and I love it. I love being hands free and shit. But sometimes I don't wanna look like a messenger a. A bike messenger guy, you know what I mean? Like, I need to look a little more like, hi, I'm. Hi. I'm an adult person more so I like this one, you know what I mean?
