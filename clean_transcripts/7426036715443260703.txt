I had therapy this morning and I have a major breakthrough in the last couple of weeks that I didn't even realize I had because it was such a normal thing that it didn't register to me that it was a breakthrough I love PTSD and childhood trauma around alcohol and like just being around it the smell of it causes a lot of triggers anxiety panic attacks and nightmares so I really want the amount of time I sit around people who are drinking just to kind of like eliminate the triggers for me it was in therapy we were talking about like just the last couple weeks and like the move and I was talking about how my brother in law and his girlfriend and their friends are over here drinking and helping us with moving and all of the stuff that we had going on and she's like wait a minute wait wait wait a minute we can't skip over this like you had drinking in your home and it didn't trigger a pain attack it didn't trigger nightmares like this is a huge huge step for you and it was just such a normal experience that I didn't even think about it and that is huge for me because normally their drinking caused me a lot of anxiety and it's usually a trigger for a nightmare that night and the fact that I was able to one buy the alcohol which is huge but two like have them drinking at my home and feel comfortable and safe and not be so like anxiety written that I couldn't function that was like a turning point that has not happened in basically my whole life and was huge like I can finally see how I am re processing some of the memories and having able to have a normal experience
