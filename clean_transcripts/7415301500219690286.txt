I got asked the other day “how do I feel about my man having a girl best friend?” he absolutely does have a girl best friend he does everything with her They go out to dinner together on weekends weeknights it doesn't matter They hang out at home watch Netflix play board games and cuddle on the couch Not only that they talk all the time text Snapchat you name it Facetime they're doing it all the time they even go on vacations together just them I personally think it's great that he has someone in his life that he never gets bored of he always wants to see her hang out with her Because.. that girl is me I am his only girl best friend
