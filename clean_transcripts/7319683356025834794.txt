so as we go into the New Year and some of you are gonna be like oh my god my relationship is the one thing I'm gonna work on I'm gonna make sure that we go to therapy and we get everything right um hear me loud and hear me clear when I say a lot of times uh narcissist will use the therapy to fuck with you even worse they know how to put on a mask and put on a show for the therapist and then they'll get the therapist involved in kinda making you the problem and you just feel even fucking crazier so before you go jumping into some couples counselling and shit trying to work on shit start some individual therapy make sure you got your shit unlocked make sure you know who the fuck you are what the fuck you got going on do you know what I mean before you go to some couples counselling where Homeboy is gonna be on his best behaviour to begin with playing up a show for the therapist who's meeting all of you for the first time so they're making their impressions and they're gonna go along with this like I mean I don't know like you only see a therapist for 30 45 maybe 60 minutes a week it's real easy to put on a show and it's real easy for them to be pushing your buttons leading up to those appointments so that when you get there you're a little bit on edge and you're not able to think clearly speak clearly and and express yourself correctly and they're nice and fucking cool calm and collected and they got that mask on tight so before you start some couples counseling cause you're gonna work on your relationship this year work on yourself first work on yourself first work on yourself first a building is made above of bricks individual bricks that what that's what makes the whole fucking building right you are one brick in the building that is your relationship so make sure that foundation is solid and that foundation is you make sure your salad don't get mine fucked in some bullshit and and get this year off on some crazy shit you wanna work on that relationship that starts with you you are half of that relationship get your shit straight and then you could go to some couples counseling
