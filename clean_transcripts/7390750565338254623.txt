Men and women are not the same. And that is a blessing. He provides and protects, I multiply. He is the head of the family, I am the heart. He provides the shelter, I give it a heartbeat. He provides the ingredients, I make the meal. He provides the house, I make it into a home. He takes care of my outer world, I take care of his inner world. He gave me love, I gave him life. Our roles compliment rather than compete. Where god created two from one, two became one in marriage. Equal value, equal honour. Equally needed for the family.
