one of the things that's making it hard for you to do it is that you're mentally beating yourself up about it it feels so ridiculous to me that you're feeling this way no it shouldn't feel ridiculous to you give yourself the Grace that you would want someone else to give you do you know what I mean be the first kind voice to talk to yourself so the way you can reframe that to yourself is I'm feeling a lot of anxiety about doing things by myself but that's a normal and natural feeling and I'm just gonna continue thinking about it until I get ready to do it and start small go to get a coffee by yourself like instead of going through the drive through park and go into the coffee shop order your coffee and then walk out maybe y'all must have the energy to like sit down and drink your coffee by yourself for a minute when you first start doing it always have something to keep yourself busy like be on your phone people throw shit fits because oh when we're together with people who are on our phone but when you're fucking by yourself what else you gonna do be on your phone so go enjoy your fucking dinner read some articles on your phone that you've wanted to do cause it does feel nice to be in a room with other people you're not alone at least you're you're there among company people are probably gonna think you're and you know what you do in your mind put give off the energy think to yourself I am a wealthy business owner that's why I'm having dinner by myself later I'm meeting up with my amazing group of business associates to talk about all my fucking money and amazing shit even if it's not true just like tell yourself the story pretend it's fucking Halloween and cosplay for the night as somebody that's fucking confident confidence is all fucking made up you fake it till you make it and you you act like you're supposed to be somewhere act like you're allowed to be doing something and people will be like oh okay okay so I'm cheering you on and you need to start cheering yourself on and be gentle to yourself
