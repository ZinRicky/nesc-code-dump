have you ever noticed that people with the highest walls have the deepest love women out there who have their guard up who don't easily let people in unless they're worth it have the deepest love these women have the biggest hearts and honestly men are like this too you see men out there that have these tough exteriors but behind closed doors they're lovey dovey and they let you in they're the sweetest most lovable people people have their walls up for a multitude of reasons maybe it was the way they were raised or maybe just people wronged them in the past people treated them poorly so they learn to build their guard up they learn to build their walls not let just anybody in ever if you're patient enough and fortunate enough to break down their walls then you get to experience that deep love because they don't just let anybody in their lives so next time you meet someone who is guarded or maybe has a tough exterior consider that their love isn't easy to earn but it is 100% worth it
