remember when people said that the Barbie movie was too basic and that our world wasn't that sexist every movie was a test um we failed while the highest grossing movie of the year did get a nomination for Best Picture the woman who was responsible for pulling off that great feat didn't the only explanation for Greta growing being left out of a category in which she overperformed in is that the Academy Award voters um believe that Barbie directed itself like you know um the dishwasher just unloaded itself or um the kids were raised by themselves you know that the entire way that we invisibleize the belly burner society in our economy but Gerwig wasn't the only woman whose labour went unrecognised margorabi who actually fought for the movie to exist um convincing executives they would have mass appeal also got shut out at this point you're wondering well I guess Ryan Gosling didn't get a nomination either if everyone's getting shut out no he did you sure did people are saying that the Academy lost the plot of the movie but actually they just brought it to life according to their own data the Oscars are the motordojo casa house without the lazy boys 67% of the voting members are male and 81% are white which makes the Oscars one of the most biased institutions in history for every one female director there have been 59 male directors nominated to quote America Ferreira who did earn a nomination thank god we have to always be extraordinary but somehow we're always doing it wrong it's literally impossible to be a woman and while this is painful this is not an embarrassing moment for women it's an embarrassing moment for the Academy Awards they are not proving the revalence of Barbie they are only cementing their own I've said it as a reward and I'm gonna say it about the Academy Awards institutions only have the legitimacy that we get them when they do stuff that's not in line with the people that they're supposed to serve they get served the Oscars is losing viewers every single year um and you know who could be like really good um to help you um with increasing viewership the two women who broke historical records Greta Gerwick and Margot Robbie single handedly revived a dying business like got people to go to the movies not just go to the movies but like dress up to go to the movies so if the Oscars wanna remain relevant maybe they can start by not shutting out the two women who would give them a shot at doing that
