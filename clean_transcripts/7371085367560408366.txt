Maturing is realizing that I would 100% rather be at home doing what I love maybe it's gardening cooking a good recipe, hanging out with my husband or my cats over going to a club or bar any day we don't have time for that if you're someone who likes to go out and party and drink but I promise you just stayed home and smelled the roses a little I guarantee your life would become 100% more valuable and will be better
