I got it from the TikTok shop. You can get one if you want one. I am so fucking excited to face the fucking world. You know who the fuck I is, bitch? I may be a millennial, but I'm a happy, kind one. I'm gonna be nice and friendly and fun. Shut up. I love this sweater. I love it. It's not shitty like you would think, you know what I mean? Just cause you got it on the TikTok shop, there's nothing shady or weird about it. This shit is cute. So happy to wrap for rainbow bright.
