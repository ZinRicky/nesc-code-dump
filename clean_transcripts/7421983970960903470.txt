Fall and winter are basically non existent where I live in Southwest Florida, so I am very, very picky about the clothes I purchased for cold weather season because I only get to pick, like, one or two things because I just don't wear a whole lot. And I saw this real life fleece shirt from Outdoor Nation, and I knew I had to have it. It is a microfiber fleece. It's really warm. This is gonna be, like, my only staple item that I wear all fall and winter long. It has snaps, so, like, if you live in the cold weather, you can easily layer this, but I can wear it as, like, my outer layer jacket. Super comfy, super cozy. For me, this is a size small. It has nice coverage. It has these pockets, and everything is snaps, which I really, really like because sometimes zippers get stuck. This is a really cute piece. You can layer it or wear it as another jacket. Super, super comfy. And I cannot wait for our cool days that we do get to rock this.
