love is not blind does anyone actually believe that it is genuinely curious because I genuinely believe love is not blind and that TV show Love Is Blind only proves my point it's just not okay men are initially driven by looks visually and they stay for personality or intelligence typically it's about looks for men okay they don't know you they don't know your personality or if you're funny all they care about is if you look good like understanding personality and character to them it's beyond them initially okay they don't care about that they care about looks that's why this show is love is blind is so hilarious to me and they're all like oh I'm looking for love I don't care about looks and then they see their partner or who they fell in love with and they're all shocked no brainer there love is not blind okay you fall for someone or you're interested in them for their looks at first, and then you fall in love with their personality and character y'all have second thoughts after and okay some do end up working but I'm just saying for majority love is not blind mmm mmm but come on you can't tell me love is blind no
