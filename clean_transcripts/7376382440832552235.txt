My husband's birthday is coming up, so I decided to surprise him by cooking him an Italian inspired dinner tonight. Started by making some mozzarella cheese for my tomato and mozzarella salad. Combine some milk with citric acid and some run it before slicing it up and returning it back to the heat. Once all the way separates from the curds, spoon them into my cheese cloth and let them drain before returning them to some hot water and shaping my mozzarella. Once that was done, I moved on to deflating my focaccia dough that had been rising for about four hours. I turned it out and let that rise for another hour while I got started on my pasta dough. This was very simple. It was just some flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt. I needed that until it was smooth and then wrapped it up in plastic wrap. One night I threw together this random fennel and leak pasta, and ever since then, my husband has been asking me to make it again. So today was the day I finally sliced up some leak and fennel. For setting that aside this point, my focaccia dough was ready to get dimpled and popped in the oven. So I opted to make a cumin seed and lemon focaccia. I put that in the oven and then got started on shaping my pasta. We went for a simple fettuccine shape today, and I put all of my pasta on my drying Rack to dry before I prepped my salad. I used some heirloom tomatoes, the mozzarella I made earlier, a drizzle of olive oil, salt, pepper, and basil. I sliced up my focaccia and plated that before I moved on to finishing my pasta. Sauteed my leek and fennel with some garlic and a splash of white wine before adding my pasta into my sauce and slowly ladling that pasta water and Parmesan cheese in to make a sauce before plating it all up and finishing it with some Parmesan cheese on top.
