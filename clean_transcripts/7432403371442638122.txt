hey guys so I talk about abortion every day often on this app and I find that people have a hard time grasping or like believing me when I talk about the dangers of the fetal personhood movement which is conservatives movement to give fetuses constitutional rights equal to the woman or anyone else walking around I'm just putting this comments out here remind you guys that these people exist they're trying to like create this alternate reality and convince people that it's not really a woman growing a fetus with her body it's not her body it's this completely independent human being that just like happens to be inside of her we should talk about the dangers of the fetal personhood movement right like you will see pregnancy criminalization levels that you've never seen we're already seeing stories of people being criminalized for their miscarriage because states are saying what wasn't actually a miscarriage we think it was a self induced abortion consider addicts who get pregnant right so right now you know we want we don't want to criminalize addicts who get pregnant because we want them to go to the doctor we want them to seek help obviously they won't do that because if you're an addict and you get pregnant you will know that you're not only facing potential negligence charges but you might even be facing murder charges which again they won't seek medical care so it will have disastrous health outcomes for everyone involved certainly not hope the fetus I don't see where pregnancy criminalization in a fetal personhood world ends so I mean you could be doing anything maybe um you harm your fetus because you were texting and driving and you got in an accident where um you had a bad diet like you did anything that harmed the fetus you're potentially facing jail time now and again we are already seeing this please vote blue in the selection
