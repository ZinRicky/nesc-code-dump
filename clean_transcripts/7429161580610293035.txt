okay so imagine this like alternate universe and in this alternate universe weÂ haveÂ neverÂ hadÂ aÂ maleÂ president!!Â ğŸ¤¯ right all 45 women. not a single man. finally we start having some male nominees right if that was the case the most unhinged possible thing women could start saying would be â€¦.you really shouldn't vote for somebody just based off their gender but in this universe where that is happening that's literally what they're saying to us like that's again that's the most unhinged possible stupid thing you could possibly say like are you sure you're the person who gets to be lecturing on that who not only only voted for men for being men but you also only allowed men to vote and your god is a man and he had a son and his son had 12 male best friends but yeah you should like really not just follow people for their genders
