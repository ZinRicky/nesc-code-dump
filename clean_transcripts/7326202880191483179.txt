hey besties my last video that went viral is now got 2 million views about me at the food stamps office by the way my food stamps did get approved I did find out in that meeting that they got approved the phone lines were down which was why I had to go in um but anyway after that video went viral Buzzfeed reached out to me and was like hey can we write an article about chadwives and your experience as a traditional life and how you know what it ended up looking like in the end and I was like yeah of course and then this huge podcaster was like hey would you like to be on my podcast you know to talk about that as well and I was like yeah and then when I start getting all that attention um it becomes really overwhelming and I go hide a little bit and so that's what I've been doing I've been posting here and there but also just hiding hiding from the internet and from people because people are mean and scary even though not too many people have been mean and scary in that video um there's still some mean and nasties even you know whatever so I'm back I'm inching my way back out of my little bubble cause I do miss all my friends I love you I miss you um so yeah otherwise I'm doing really good but I just I get really intimidated by the internet ha ha
