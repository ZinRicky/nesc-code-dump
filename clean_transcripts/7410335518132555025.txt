if you're hanging on by a thread might I suggest popping on some 90s rap and waterblasting the absolute fkn shit out of your house and sure there might be some other more pressing jobs that I should be doing such as I don't know watering that plant but it's recently come to my attention that the front of my house is not looking very demuretsy it's looking like we squat here it's giving I've never cleaned a day in my life PS not sure if I'm very early for Christmas decorations or 8 months late at taking them down and I'd really like to blame winter for the state of all of this so I will. it's because of winter anyway even though I should probably be finishing at least one of my many half finished projects I haven't been able to sleep at night because I've been thinking about this and I think what set me off was over the weekend I was still cleaning one of my kids bedrooms and I was doing the windows and doing the blinds and it was pretty hard to ignore the fact that outside it was absolute carnage and then I realised that sometimes people come to my house and they will look at that and I'm pretty sure they will judge me Itâ€™s ok, even I'm judging me anyway halfway point and I'm pretty sure all of that dirt has transferred itself from the house and on to me and we've talked before about the sheer amount of admin that comes with being an adult human let alone being an adult human with tiny humans in tow and the irony is certainly not lost on me that we have to literally clean our houses inside and out over and over forever and ever until we die so one question I had while cleaning all of this is do I have a spider problem? cause I was fkn horrified - for lack of a bit of term over the omnipresence of the webs because they were everywhere over every window over every weather board all over the soffits are they called soffits? my cute little overhang thing anyway once I power washed everything I hooked up a universal cleaner through my water blaster and made it all soapy then I power washed it again and I'm really hoping that that's gonna put a dampener on my spider problem by the way if you do think the house is infested with spiders can you please just tell me it's not? cause that will make me feel much better at least they're not poisonous though cause I'm not Australian Anyway onto to the least aesthetic stairs to ever exist and if you don't already know we're part way through renovating a beautiful big mid century home which is just gagging for some TLC some areas are still kinda ugly but that's okay cause I don't mind if it's ugly so long as it's clean which is a sentence I say to my husband a few times a week I finished with the frontage and it's looking less dero and more demure although the weather's closed in so it's gonna look messy again by the morning I'd imagine and I did have grand plans to do up a nice little pot by the front door with some new plants I bought today but I'm currently freezing soaking and over it so check back tomorrow for the update
