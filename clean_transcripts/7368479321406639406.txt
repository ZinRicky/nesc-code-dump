this is so valid because you want your friends to like your partner at the end of the day there's a line and if they cross that line you know when your girls are looking at your man in a different way or complimenting him or talking about him like chill you're not his friend you're my friend I had a friend once who when I showed them my partner who like drooling over the picture I was showing him and I was like yeah I know he's hot and weird you know what happened she ended up being shady as hell that's why I have trust issues with friends I'm like by adios do not have time for it do not cross that line with me
