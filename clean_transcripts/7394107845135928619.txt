we're gonna talk about this because this makes me so mad this was not an unavoidable accidental death this was a choice there has been a heat advisory for a while couple weeks now in certain places it was 120 degrees there is no way that that baby had any business being outside for hours you learn so much before you have your first child about a kid's ability to um temperature regulate you learn how to get them to make sure that they're warm when they're sleeping even though you need a fan on for air circulation every single baby monitor checks the temperature of the room that they're in why do you think they do that because infants cannot regulate their body temperature the way an adult can and not only that those adults were regulating their body temperature by jumping into the water to cool off now my take on this is the idea that parents are supposed to and have to prioritize the well being of their children before themselves at least I don't know through childhood I am so sick to death of seeing videos of parents going to ride uh like Universal Studios roller coasters and leaving their babies in fucking public areas in strollers because they wanna go ride a ride or parents deciding to take take their child into dangerous hazardous conditions because they don't wanna miss out on 4th of July you miss out you miss out when you prioritize your child above your wants and wishes and that's okay it's a chapter of life it goes by relatively quickly and it's what you're supposed to do I wouldn't even bring my dog onto a boat where they couldn't get off and couldn't drink water and couldn't regulate their temperature for a day on the boat like that and that's and that's my dog your life will change your priorities have to change when you bring a child into this earth they cannot protect themselves that is your job that is your job this was avoidable and it is just negligence hundred percent
