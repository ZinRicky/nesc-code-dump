It's Sunday, which means it is football day. And around here we are house divided. We do not root for the same teams. But today our teams are playing a different times. So I am playing the supportive wife role and I am supporting his favorite teams. Colors, if you know. You know, it is giving off those vibes. Teal and orange, it is perfect. I can be the supportive wife, cheer on his team without cheering on his team. You know, I love this shirt. It is lightweight, it is super soft, perfect for fall. And it comes in a lot of different colors. So if you want to be a supportive wife, get yourself one of these shirts. And if you don't like football and you don't wanna be a supportive wife, check out the other colors because they are amazing.
