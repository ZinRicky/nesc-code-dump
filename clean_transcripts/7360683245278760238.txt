Iâ€™ve said this before and I'll say it again expecting a man to lead and you're not listening is absolutely bonkers it's not that serious just listen women who let their partners lead are generally happier if you want to be a feminist go for it But most women don't want to wear the pants in the relationship so listen, listen to your man but also you should choose the right partner where you do trust to let them lead you can't just do this with anybody but when you do find the right person life is so easy you have life on easy mode You don't have to worry about as much you can walk out with him close your eyes, turn off your brain because guess what he's taking care of everything he's making sure you don't get ran over girls you get it because sometimes we be walking around not even looking around your guy is there being like hold on babe and you listen don't say what?? we listen most people don't get this but when you do a light bulb just switches on your brain and you're so much happier When you're letting your man lead the relationship He can be your king and you can be his queenðŸ©µ
