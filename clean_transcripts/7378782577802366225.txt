I think I just cracked the code for the quickest easiest and most flavoursome weeknight burgers and I'm gonna go ahead and assume that your weeknights are about as crazy as mine as we've got kids activities four out of five nights of the week and on those nights we get home late with tired hungry children and they want food and they want it now and fair enough cause same but also at this point in the day I've run out of capacity so I just wanna put something together that tastes good and doesn't stress me I started by putting the new limited edition Angel Bay Smoky Barbeque Beef Patties in a pan and Angel Bay will always live rent free in my freezer cause you can just cook them from frozen and the quality is really good then I got started on a quick caramelised red onion and when I say quick I mean quick just saute add brown sugar and balsamic vinegar and you are good to go but I wanted to make it cause I felt like it would perfectly complement the flavours in the Patty they made from beef, caramelised onions gherkins, whole grain mustard blackout rub and natural smoke and then I made a little ‘build your own’ burger station because I like when dinner's interactive and I like giving my kids freedom of choice we've got lettuce from the garden tomatoes cucumber gherkins Swiss cheese those caramelised red onions toasted brioche buns and tomato sauce mayonnaise and mustard which is a flavour combination made in heaven and you can't convince me otherwise the new smoky barbeque flavour sensation has been made in collaboration with Olympian Dame Lisa Carrington and $1 from every packet sold goes to the Save the Kiwi charity I'm the sort of person who always gets down on a good burger but I'm also kind of fussy like it's gotta actually taste good and not a word of a lie this was insane
