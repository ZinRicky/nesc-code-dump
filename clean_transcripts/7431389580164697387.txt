Once it clicks that you can make anything you want from scratch, yes, including Snickers, you'll never go back to buying the ultra processed junk again. I started by making my new got first by whipping egg white until stiff peaks formed, then cooking the unrefined natural sugars into a thick caramel at 200 2 degrees Fahrenheit. I slowly drizzled this hot syrup into the whipped egg white, but quickly moved it to a bowl with a hand mixer, which worked much better. This was like marshmallow fluff, it was so smooth and satiny. I poured the fluff into a butter dish, although I would use Parchment paper next time, then move that to the fridge to firm up for a few hours. Then I got to making the caramel filling with butter, coconut sugar, water and cream. I chopped up some almonds and added those into the thick caramel and then spread this on top of my chilled newgot. While that firmed up in the fridge, I made my dark chocolate. A very quick process. Lastly, I cut the newgot and caramel nut filling into small pieces, dipped each piece in the chocolate, then placed in the fridge to firm up for a few minutes. Afterwards, I dunked each Snickers again for an extra thick double dunked candy. I can't tell you how good these were. They're actually drool worthy and if I keep making them, I'll get better at the shape. I can confidently say I feel good About feeding my kids a Snickers bar. As long as it's homemade with real ingredients.
