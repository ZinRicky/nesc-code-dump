has there ever been a point in your life where you thought that you are a better Christian or a better person or more loved by god because of the rules that you followed or the dress code that you followed because that was me for 20 years of my life I believed that I was more loved and better than other Christians because of what I did or did not do something that I've been realising the last few months is that my performance issues have not just been about people but they've also been about god and his view of me in the way that I believed for so long that he viewed me I think that I really viewed god more as a mean boss in the sky just waiting for me to fail instead of a loving father who is excited to welcome me home anytime I mess up or fail because he knows I'm not perfect and he wants to perfect me in his Grace and in his I want to live a life that honours and pleases the Lord in all that I do not to earn my salvation or somehow earn God's love but out of the joy of my salvation and all the peace that comes with knowing him
