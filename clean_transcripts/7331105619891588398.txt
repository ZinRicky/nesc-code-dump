Here's everything I eat in a day. As someone that loves to cook but is also 30 weeks pregnant, I hate the taste of water so I always need to add stuff to it. Today it was cucumber and mint. I also wake up craving fresh orange juice everyday. So today I made a grapefruit orange juice. Got started on making some wild blueberry compote to go alongside my cassava flour waffles. These are so easy to make and they always turn out so crispy but chewy in the middle. They're my favorite thing, so I ended up having two of those with my blueberry compote. So good! And then for a midday beverage, you guys know I always need to have one. I made a vanilla blueberry iced tea, started on making some lunch, and chopped up some green onions and lemongrass to go inside my Vietnamese pork lemongrass meatballs. I seared those off and then got started on making my vermicelli salad. I Julian some carrots and some cucumber, made a nok chom dressing, and then assembled it all with some fresh herbs. Don't forget the mint, my meatballs, the noodles! This was so refreshing but feeling at the same time in the afternoon. Needed a little sweet pick me up. So I made a lime whipped cream to go inside of my papaya. Dinner was something easy and quick so made a roast chicken. I spatchcock my chicken and then made a little gochujang marinade to go All over it. Love a roast chicken because you can just make it pop in the oven and forget about it for a few hours. And I cut up some root vegetables, toss them in the leftover marinade, and then laid my chicken on top of some onion and garlic. I added some chicken stock to my cast iron and put that in the oven. That was almost done. I made a garlic yuzu spinach, and then I pulled out my beautiful chicken, carved myself up a piece, and that was my dinner. I love something comforting to end my day.
