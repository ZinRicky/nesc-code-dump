so my posts are gonna be all over the place this week um life is continuing as normal here in Charleston and I'm gonna be posting some of my regular stuff but on the back of my mind constantly is what's going on in North Carolina and how I can help Matt and I are going on a trip this weekend to Utah like my kids still have school and activities it's the Jewish New Year this weekend so life for us is continuing on pretty much as normal but I've just posted a comprehensive list of places that you can donate to help the relief efforts for Western North Carolina on top of that I am starting to collect supplies me and Matt are planning to go up early next week grocery stores are already low on stuff things around Charleston are starting to get low um I saw Costco and Walmart in Mount Pleasant already out of water I think everyone's anticipating either another Hurricane realizing how unprepared we are and anticipating the longshoreman strike so if you're local to the Charleston area make sure that you are prepared for a storm event if you have anything extra you can donate to bring up to North Carolina you can message me or there are lots of neighborhoods that are collecting items right now that you can donate to as well things like gas batteries blankets baby items so like formula diapers baby wipes water is a big one water and gasoline I think are the biggest ones but honestly anything that y'all can donate um I know it doesn't feel like enough but every little bit is going to help so along with my regularly scheduled content I will be posting as many updates as I can about Western North Carolina from friends and loved ones who I get information from from other resources from Facebook groups etc I just heard today actually a big announcement that I forty is open I forty East is open from Asheville and they're saying that there are supplies in Hickory and east of that as well I forty West is still closed but the North Carolina dot is saying that it should be reopening soon and I got that information from North Carolina's weather authority which is a Facebook group that I have been receiving updates on the situation in North Carolina if you wanna follow along go ahead and check them out as well it seems to be the best place to get the most up to date information about the relief efforts
