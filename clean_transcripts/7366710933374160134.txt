I wanna uh present a petition today signed by Canadians across the country. Uh, these things are concerned about the nearly hundred thousand preborn children who die every year uh since the mortgage mortgage decision. Canada is only one of two uh nations in the world that has zero uh laws protecting the preborn. Uh they they also note that uh Charles heartbeat begins when the child is uh 6 weeks old and they are calling on the government of Canada and this place to strengthen the protections for the preborn in Canada. Thank you Mister Speaker. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. The federal conservatives have attempted for many years to open up a debate on abortion in Canada by sneaking in legislation or motions or like the petition from yesterday. Abortion is healthcare. It's as simple as that. We don't legislate prostate exams or erectile dysfunction treatment or breast exams or MRI's or any other healthcare procedures because it's healthcare. So don't get LED into a false sense of security about abortion access here in Canada. The federal conservatives are trying everything they can to legislate our healthcare and they've been attempting to do so for years. So now is not the time to be complacent or to let our guard down as I have said for many years and as the federal conservatives have repeatedly shown us given the chance will attempt to limit access to abortion or attempt an outright ban on abortion. In Canada. So every opportunity that you have, call out the conservatives and use your voice when it's time to vote.
