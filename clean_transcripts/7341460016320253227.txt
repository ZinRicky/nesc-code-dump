I just saw a video from a mom who her narcissistic co parent is not allowing her to see her oldest child on his birthday it's his weekend so sucks to suck WAP WAP you don't get to see the kid today and I've been there and it does hurt and I just wanted to give you some perspective there's you know there's three pieces to this conflict that's going on the other parent the child and you the other parent is doing this just to hurt you there's no consideration for the child whatsoever cause obviously a child is gonna want all the people they love to be present at big events so this has everything to do with you and nothing to do with the child whatever big Celebration or whatever the fuck he did for the kid that is not for the kid that is to try to rub shit in your face the reason he's doing it is to fucking hurt you to ruin your day to make you cry so you know what I started to to started to do instead on my children's birthday I celebrate me if they're not with me I gave birth that was a big fucking day for me too and I'm gonna I'm gonna have cake on my kid's birthday I I always do this if I don't have them on their birthday I buy a cake and I celebrate them myself I celebrate myself for having the child and I celebrate my child and I make sure to save a piece of that cake when they come home and then we have their birthday cake together and the kids know what's going on they fully understand cause they probably ask is mom gonna be here and when dad looks him in the face and says no or whatever bullshit they are go like you're an adult you were able to look back on your childhood and shake out what was true what wasn't who was a dick who wasn't your kid is gonna do the same so don't give the ex the satisfaction of having it ruin your day fuck you you know what I gave birth today and you know what on that birthday I was so fucking tired and exhausted when I gave birth to my kid I'm happy to have a day to celebrate myself make myself feel good and when I see my baby they're gonna be happy to see mommy anyway we're gonna celebrate he's not taking anything from you he's being a petty little prick and in the end you will win so in the meantime just know that uh you did the right thing he's just trying to punish you and just don't accept that punishment I love you
