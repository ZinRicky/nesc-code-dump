Let's bottle this kombucha and make a new batch. For this batch, I decided to add lavender and lemon. I've been on a real lavender kick lately, and I think it's the spring summer feels. It's just so yummy. So all I did was add lavender tea and squeeze two lemons and then just add it to the bottle to kombucha. Some comments that I got is that this has a lot of sugar. It has three fourths cups of sugar in a gallon. But the kombucha eats the sugar as it ferments. It has to have something to feed on. I set the bottled kombucha on my counter to carbonate for two days, and we're ready for another batch.
