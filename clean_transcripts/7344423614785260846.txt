Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's not that they're avoiding the problem or they're not listening to you, they just need a minute they're processing it at their rate. so don't attack them if they're not processing it quickly, or how you'd like them to; let them think/process. No. 3- men are single focused beings meaning if you interrupt him while he's busy, he will either take longer to process what you just said, or he might not even hear what you said at all. so let them stop what they're doing, wait until they're not busy before you try to communicate with them. #4- men are wired to protect and provide so if he sees you as something valuable then he's gonna want to protect and provide for you men naturally want to provide for you and your family so if he does you should appreciate him for doing so allow him to provide No.5- men are visual creatures and feel most connected to you during physical intimacy they won't necessarily feel closer to you, when YOU wanna talk about your feelings, it's just not how they operate. since they are visual creatures, make sure you're taking care of yourself to keep that romance alive!
