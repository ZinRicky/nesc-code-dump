Like clockwork. As soon as the relationship starts taking a dive, what happens? They're expecting their first child. This toxic little prick knows that. She's getting wise to his shit. He already tried the religion spin and committed we can't get a divorce. God, sins, blah blah, blah. That didn't work. She was probably still considering divorce. And now they're having a baby. Awesome. Guarantee they're gonna be divorced in three years. She's gonna be a happy little single mom to a two year old baby. Guaranteed. You fucking Mark my words.
