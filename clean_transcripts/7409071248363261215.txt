I am here to tell you, if you're miserable in your marriage, you do not need to stay just because you have kids. You can leave, you can start a whole new life. You can get to play with makeup again and go to concerts and do all kinds of fun shit. So whoever the fuck is telling you that you need to stay in that marriage, that's what you decided. You decided to be a mother and this is your life now. They could all shove it. Cause I promise you, you only have one fucking life and you either live it or. Or what? Or what?
