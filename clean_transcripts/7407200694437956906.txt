so we're in the middle of reorganizing our entire house we have literally moved the furniture from almost every room to a different room and now every room has a different function mostly because we wanted to get our sectional couch up to the playroom so the kids could have it and make it more of a TV room and we moved our toddler upstairs because he was in a downstairs bedroom and now he's old enough to go up and downstairs by themselves and all the kids stuff being upstairs just works better for us so I already showed y'all our new home school room but one of the things I'm doing is reorganizing my office because it became the storage room for everybody else's crap so this is where we are right now it is still in an absolute state of chaos my husband just built this rack for my loungefly backpacks and I'm gonna show you the closet once it's all done um but I have the kids back to school stuff I've got to get together I've got to organise all their memory boxes I have never had a place to put my kids my mementos and stuff like that so they're just all over the house they're in different rubber maids like they're not organised so one big project I'm gonna do is organise every single thing that I have for them and I'm gonna show you the whole process in another video because I have a really cool like organizational hack and I'm not an organized person okay I can go into like manic episodes of organizing um but if I don't have a system in place it's not gonna happen so we're getting a system
