come with me to have lunch at tiffins and Animal Kingdom this was our first time at Tiffins and we were so excited to try it we have gone to the Nomad Lounge a ton of times and that is located right next door right off the bat you could tell that this was a fancier experience it is a bit of a higher price point for dining in Disney so we also had high expectations hostess explain that all the art is supposed to be observed gallery style so go walk around the rooms and enjoy the art we started off with a couple of cocktails and then immediately got the bread service and the octopus appetizers the bread service was 10 out of 10 incredible and the octopus was fork tender which if you know how to cook octopus that is difficult next we have the living off the land salad and the duo of pork it was so fun to eat the lettuces that we saw growing at our behind the seed store and they were especially delicious we both agreed that this is one of our new favourite restaurants and we will be coming back from the service to the food this was by far one of our best Disney dining experiences and as always at Disney there is a kids menu if your kids are kind of picky eaters they can still get regular things like chicken fingers or Mac and cheese let me know in the comments if you've ever eaten at tiffins what your experience was and what your favourite Walt Disney World restaurant is if you haven't tried tiffins it's time to go
