There's nothing better than a snack fixation in a comfy outfit to go along with it. The material on this set is so soft, I do not wanna take it off, and I won't for a while. So let's start with a cold Honey Crisp apple. It has to be cold and it has to be Honey Crisp. I made this date caramel yesterday with some soaked dates and coconut milk. I put that in a little glass bowl and there you go. This is so good. It's just apple and caramel. I cannot get enough of it.
