Okay. So many people have asked me what's going on in Charleston with Debbie. Um, at least for me, cannot also. Yeah, we're. We're getting ready for bed. We're trying something new. Um, nothing's happening at my house. We've had a moderately rainy day. I've run errands. It's like it hasn't been much. And we live on, um, like a tidal creek, so I kind of expect. Expected at least a little bit of flooding. I know it's worse in other places, and I know downtown is flooded. Downtown always floods. Um, so I hope everybody is safe and hunkering down. But as for us, we're good.
