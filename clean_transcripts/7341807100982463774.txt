Timothee Chalamet is experiencing fatphobia? if I heard that literally any other point in time I simply wouldn't have believed anyone saying that because this man is what 100 pounds soaking wet and I kept seeing people talk about it I was like this is that's not happening this isn't real there's no way that people are being fatphobic to Timothee Chalamet and I'm like what's going on and then I saw it I saw it with my own two eyes people are sad that he's gaining weight this first of all he's still skinny like this man is still skinny he's just now an adult like I I literally would not have believed you if I had not seen it with my own two eyes but like literally what is wrong with you people like ah are you guys like not capable of being normal to people about their weights like like you guys are so weird about people's bodies and the way you guys talk about people who gain weight it's like do you guys actually like these people or are they just kind of like vessels for you to project your fantasies onto and then when you realize a real life human beings and like real life human beings gain weight and lose weight and gain weight and lose weight and like like bodies change and it's okay and like again he's still thin like it's very skinny he's a very thin small man and I like the way that you guys are talking about it you would have guessed that like motherfucker looks like me he does it he doesn't like he gained what maybe 20 pounds what is wrong with you people I'm mmm like I would just love it if you guys could be normal about people's bodies cause like the way that y'all feel so comfortable commenting on other people's bodies is just not normal you know y'all place people's value in the way they look and then you wonder why so many people hate their bodies and are obsessed with their bodies and have eating disorders and like and this is also happening to someone who is thin conventionally attractive well loved like if he is experiencing this level of fatphobia like think about what it's like for actually fat people like I don't know I just think the world would be better if we stopped commenting on people's bodies and people's weight gain like let people just living is hard enough and I'm not saying like oh life is like so hard for Timothee Chalamet it's just like it's just weird it's weird to watch just stop talking about people's bodies that's it
