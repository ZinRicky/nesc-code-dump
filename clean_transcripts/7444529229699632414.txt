twice a year I do a heavy metals and parasite detox and it is that time this is a no way medical advice and I do this under this revision of a doctor so if you are concerned about parasites or heavy metals in your body talk to your healthcare provider but I'm using a paraguard for parasites and it's 30 drops three times a day and like about that much is three drops I just put my mouth it's not great and then I'm doing touchstone essentials for heavy metals four sprays three times a day and this one my topper broke but it is four drops three times a day the worst is a pear it just has like an herbal taste not my favorite but it's also not terrible and I just chug water flush it through my system
