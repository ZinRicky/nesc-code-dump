I have to say I have the utmost respect for women who say let me ask my husband first or men who say let me run it by the way first see what people don't understand is of course they can make decisions on their own when you're in a relationship where you value the person so much you don't make decisions on your own good relationship is not about being exclusive it's about being inclusive
