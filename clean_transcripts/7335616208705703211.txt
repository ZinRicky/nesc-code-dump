okay I'm not I know I'm not the only one who has seen these but are you seeing these like sponsored posts just like dedicated to like my man my man my man on TikTok today like what the fuck ah I just feel like if you feel the need to like pay to sponsor a post on TikTok announcing your relationship with some man I wonder if you're doing that truly to tell your man that you love him or if you're just trying to get the word out that he's taken cause maybe he's not that faithful and you're trying to like do these big grand gestures of love so that he could love you back but you're really just like spinning a wheel cause he's probably cheating with somebody else because I'm seeing the men in these like sponsored posts like dedications to their man cause I click on it cause you can understand if you understand the thing like they're not trying to sell anything so if this has sponsored that means somebody paid to have their TikTok pushed in front of people so you go to check their page and it's a page where the person's got like 1,000 followers then this really is they're just posting like this is my car this is my food today they're not like creating content they're just using the app and and having fun and posting like which is what makes it which is why it's weird that they're sponsoring posts like is that your Valentine to him I don't I'm not judging and I'm not being mean I'm just wondering where the heart behind that is do you know what I'm saying
