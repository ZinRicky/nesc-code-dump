yeah you know you either want time with your grandchildren or you want to do a power play if somebody asking for a couple days or even a couple weeks home to bond and heal with their Newborn makes you want to use your grandparental babysitting as a tool to use against them that's pretty heinous because it shows that you look at babysitting as a chore or a favor for the parents not an opportunity to bond or spend time with your grandchild even when I have gone through rough patches with my own in laws they have never not wanted to see their grandchildren and honestly the fact that they love and care and want to see their grandchildren that much is one of the reasons we've been able to get over some of our difficult patches in our own relationship you wanna see a baby so bad that you wanna be in the delivery room you definitely will still probably wanna see that baby that bad two weeks later all I can guess with the comment like this is that it's not actually about seeing the kid or having a relationship it's much more about your ego and her feelings word to the wise too soon to be future grandparents don't be like Ed here and you'll do just fine
