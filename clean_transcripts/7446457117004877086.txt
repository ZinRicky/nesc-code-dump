it is Monday we had a super busy weekend this weekend I did not get any lesson planning done we are tired and overstimulated we need a day to just chill and relax now before you come at me and tell me that put my kids in school because I'm not giving them a good education let me just remind you I'm a former teacher and I promise you there is nothing academic happening in schools right now it is like hurting cats teachers are in survival mode they are just trying to get to Christmas break so I promise my kids are fine their academics are fine and taking a day off is just what we need
