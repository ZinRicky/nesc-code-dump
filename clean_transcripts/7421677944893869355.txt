You all have been asking for baby content, and I met up with one of my sweet followers, Brenna, the other day, and she gave me so many hand me downs for Baby Jane. So I wanted to look at some of them and show you guys some of the adorable baby clothes today. A little sweater. Another little sweater. How adorable. Look at the detail. Hmm. Oh, and a blue sweater. And, of course, a baby bonnet. Oh, this is too precious. No, this is not for you, buddy. This adorable little dress. I can't. It's so cute. I love this, even though it's sad base. So cute. Oh, my goodness. Wow. She gave me this gorgeous ring sling. I mean, look at that. Does that not look like me? More bones! Thank you, Brenna. I'm so excited. Oh, my goodness. We're having a baby!
