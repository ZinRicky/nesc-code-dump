Thing about this little planter is because it's hanging in front of my window. Like, it's hanging looking at me. The little thing is growing towards the. Towards the sunlight. And it looks like it's got like, a funny little. Funny little ponytail on top of its head. This thing just brings me absolute. So much joy.
