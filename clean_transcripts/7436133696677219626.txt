I made a rookie homeschool mistake I forgot to lesson plan this weekend and start our Monday off with no plan it's not an ideal way to start the week but also not the end of the world while the kids did morning work I got my stuff together luckily I do look ahead so I had a good idea what we were gonna do today I just didn't have everything prepared so I had to wait honestly sometimes those lessons work out better than the ones I have fully prepared so for the last week I've been working on the ng confident team with math I just have to say I am struggling I have the hardest time making the ng sound by itself I don't know how to do it without putting too much emphasis on the G but when you use it in ng ng on your own you don't over emphasize the G I am just on the struggle bus I need someone to teach me how to make the ng sound and because I just can't do it I taught it as a word family to make matters worse Maverick has a little country twang to it and he never says the G at the end of a word so I'm over emphasizing and he's skipping it all together we are just the dynamic duo over here
