I think this comment is 1,000% spot on and that's why when I try and talk about my marriage especially because I am so happily married I definitely express that it is the exception to the rule I think it's important that we all take like a really realistic look at ourselves and at the people in the relationships around us and realise that like the happily ever after version of marriage is much more the exception than the role and I say this is somebody who is like enamored with my husband and happily married but these ideas or these ideals for women being a wife being a mother have always been seen as the natural progression of a woman's life and I think we need to start really talking about these things as options because if somebody is to ask me if marriage is worth it I can only say it's worth it for me same thing with motherhood it's worth it for me and a lot of those circumstances come from luck and in motherhood a lot of those circumstances come from privilege I share my happiness in my marriage and in my motherhood journey because it is a reality for me but I'm very aware very aware of it not being the reality for a lot of people
