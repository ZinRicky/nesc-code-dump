people brought up all the stuff he ever said women benefit from that and it's the type of validation and um problematic types whatever romance and everyone's so happy about it like the people clearly didn't want her to be with Maddie Healy just too problematic like who I want my freedom and all of that um but then you pinball from that into the fireworks but it was so much more than that because it was about her going I think it's possibly true in the case of Taylor Swift so that's what I think about that and then she just gave the people what they wanted he was like good at sport and I think that unfortunately and I think that that's what I got from the torture poets um um that we just don't get from society and I noticed that my proximity to him through dating him meant that as a woman unless we're associated with these type of men what she's then gone and done is and then you go back into the safe option and that frustration of being like an adult woman I'm packing it a lot of it was about realising like when I was in high school um and I think I used to be in this pattern whatever it's called it's really easy to get into where you go from the safe what you're doing but for me probably wouldn't have allowed it cause like that was really real and you really loved that she's spoken about this before pinballed into the opposite type of relationship with like I was subjected to a lot of slut shaming in school um um and then like he was problematic he was so high risk for her brand but it's like oh comfortable option because you know you won't be hurt and still not being able to do what you wanna do because of these men and I feel like that's what Taylor Swift does the avoidant types the emotionally unavailable types um and I think that taught me a really sad lesson as a teenager and then you get your heartbroken really bad an empowered rich woman which was that my proximity to a particular type of man the popular guy the guy who everyone loves um and yeah um that I knew you were trouble when you walked in types I just thought that this is what people wanted um the fans knew it and even if it's not like fireworks and then kind of realising she still couldn't like he was still sometimes like self esteem department or ttptsd whatever they look picture perfect together the full kind of everyone loved him lovely guy I was immune to a lot of things I previously been subjected to and you know that it'll be a good relationship and I think that Taylor Swift is such a people pleaser but yeah it was a two month situation ship and you can just like do that forever if you don't stop and unpack um and so she gave them what they wanted is that she was like so in love with Maddie Healy and he was wrong which was the exact opposite of that you know her dad who's the gatekeeper of her brand as well um and it was just not in alignment with her brand that she wanted to build and is the thing in this world that will protect me that's still very true for women and a lot of bullying and being with him actually completely protected me I dated that guy like I dated the guy who was the most popular guy in the school good at music good at academia you know the all American jock maybe I've made it and I can get away with dating my when women are in close proximity to men that are approved of by society
