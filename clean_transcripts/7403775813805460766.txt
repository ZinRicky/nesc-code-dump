This is what I got to save my sanity. There's actually six of us that live in my house that have to use this bathroom. This is all the space we have. Just, like, so much stuff we keep in this that we kind of want accessible all the time, but we didn't want the counter all clogged up. And so this thing has been a lifesaver. And my kids keep saying that our bathroom feels like a hotel bathroom. So I love it. I love it, I love it. Super worth it.
