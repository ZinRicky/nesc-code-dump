I ditched the USA to go to this biohacking retreat in Sayulita, Mexico for one week and on our first day we sat in Temazcal a traditional Mexican sweat lodge it was treated like a psychedelic experience facilitated by a Mexican native the whole retreat felt like a ceremony in itself a container where I was able to meet other like minded women unlike anywhere else and this time I was able to bring my favourite human during this week long adventure I kept saying to myself you know you're lucky if you meet even one incredible person every five years and that's if you're lucky but in this case it's like meeting a lifetime of your brothers and sisters from previous lives because everyone is already vetted everyone already knows what's going on in the world and everyone's health is their number one priority most of these people also heal themselves from chronic illness because the medical system failed them at one point most of these people were probably vegan the main things we all have in common is the entrepreneurial drive for freedom and the desire to have more like minded people in our lives and this retreat was the perfect container to facilitate that
