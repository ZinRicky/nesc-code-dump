so many people said this so let's get into it and please excuse my voice I'm getting sick apparently I cannot speak for everyone situation so I'm gonna tell you about mine I have always been a stay at home mom but that is because my husband is a business owner a lot of the posts I make about mother's day are coming from the perspective of who I was when I had two under two which was slapping my kids to two sets of parents houses for the whole day exhausted sticky not really feeling like the day had anything to do with me at all I now have a 9 8 and two year old and it is a much different situation number one I only have my mother who lives close by I have since been able to vocalize like what I wanna do most of the time on Mother's Day so I like seeing my mom I just would rather see my mom without my kids around so we can actually like have a conversation so that has evolved but also to this comment me and my husband share equally a lot of the work mental load and labor of running our life I definitely have more of the kids stuff on my plate because that is my job I'm a stay at home mom and I homeschool but my husband is a business owner so he is never not working and even when he's not working and he's home he is a super involved partner so we're in the trenches together and just as he doesn't go out and golf or go out and boat or like go do the whole like typical dad thing leave me alone with the kids every weekend I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that to him either so although I'm better at taking time for myself than I ever used to be it's never gonna be like a whole random day to just like go fuck off by myself because he wouldn't do that to me so Mother's Day is like a perfect excuse to like do that for the whole day although I also wanna add in that last year for Christmas he got me an overnight stay at a hotel and a spa package just for like Christmas it's the best thing ever so he's great but he's also like we've been married for 11 years so this is this is an old conversation for us so the young moms who aren't getting what they need have the conversation evolve make sure if you're in the trenches you're not sitting there alone you got like a co captain because me and my husband may be overwhelmed but we're overwhelmed together
