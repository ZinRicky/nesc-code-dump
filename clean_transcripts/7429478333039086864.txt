it's 2:42 and I've just spent three hours in this bathroom which is an embarrassingly long time and a fact I’d prefer to omit but I'm currently in that one magical window a woman sometimes gets gifted which means I need to fit a months worth of motivation into the next Day or so. cause I don't know what's going on with my cycle at the moment but I swear it's fkn with me anyway I probably don't need to worry about that for another 2 weeks so today I'm just gonna enjoy the fact that I woke up with motivation also mum if you're watching I did go see the doctor recently so you don't need to worry once I finished with the bathroom I took a break to put dinner on low and slow so I could avoid standing in the kitchen later by standing in the kitchen now make it make sense by the way I started voicing this TikTok yesterday and I've come back to finish it now and in that time I've got sick apparently so please excuse the extra husky voice but the aim of the game is still to get this house clean and I'm kinda kicking myself cause I literally could have done the whole house In the time that it took me to just do the bathroom and now I'm kinda tired so we're just gonna boost through the next part once I’d done the kitchen and the dining room I had to physically fight myself to get back up out of this bed and then I had to face the consequences of a busy couple days and avoiding unpacking my bag and it's not sheet washing day and also I've run out of fks to give so making the bed is gonna have to do I vacuumed and mopped the floors before politely asking my children to please evacuate the lounge space And they’re definitely my children because the incentive was if they hopped off the couch they can hop back on it in a minute and it will be all fluffy and fresh ready for them to destroy and spoiler alert but that is exactly what they did but it's okay cause I tried my best and it was reset for a minute there but I'm about to Shirk all my responsibilities and run away to Australia for a night and I wanted the house to feel clean and fresh for everybody I guess it's a love language thing but also it makes me feel like I'm in a much better headspace if my house is clean anyway after all of that I think we're done and I'm pretty sure I would have hit my steps for the day except my phone's been on my tripod so I literally have no idea and now my health app is just silently judging me
