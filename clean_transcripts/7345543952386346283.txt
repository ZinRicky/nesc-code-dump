My gym just increases prices. So I got this new home wave home gym. It has all these attachments. This thing is basically a push up board and you can put it in the different color coded spots to condition in different areas, like for chest or for more shoulders or triceps or whatever. So you have all these different options. It also comes with a sheet so you can see what exercises you can do. And there's no fear when you're doing the exercises because all the little carabiners have safety latches so it's not gonna come undone. It feels really safe and secure. I am really excited to kind of have my own little home gym set up because I'm not trying to pay the prices for the gym and I never have the time to make it. If you want one for yourself, the link is right here. I highly recommend and I absolutely love this thing.
