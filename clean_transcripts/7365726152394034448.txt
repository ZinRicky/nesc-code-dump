men being the providers and protectors I need and want the admiration and Protection of men and let's just keep like redefining what strength means dominant group than you that you need it women might want a man who's gonna hold the door open for him Protection is the facade and the veneer that a lot of men who say these things but moving on I wanna talk about it I got paid to do it before you go to my comments on this app this idea is often really simplified down to the idea of a pick me need to keep women feeling unsafe in order to not make themselves redundant but it's all about control I am all for women I love women entitled to protect and dictate the terms I'm Doctor Zoe I have a PhD in feminism and yes define that for us and tell us what we need and at the end of the day and there's a difference between wanting Protection just remember that it makes you look really silly if you argue about my PhD where they are navigating and negotiating who doesn't wanna feel valued things like that and that's because the system isn't exactly in our favour why do women want men who are an at all hold doors open so this is where we get to benevolent sexism and unfortunately what chivalry means what relationships and love look like on our own terms in order to thrive in order to feel safe and protect themselves and their family but on men's terms so here's the thing I wanna protect women we protect you a lot of this is about power protect them and a gentle with kids and with women it's really understandable that at different times and not have others try to put that on us security status what would you do without us within existing powerdynamics in society I actually think that that is really sad and offered quite true for women which is like the sneaky cousin of outright misogyny it looks really nice on the surface there's nothing wrong with wanting those things let's talk about patriarchal bargaining again either that or there's an issue with some comprehension level how you turn something so lovely into something so awful because I fear that I might not have made myself clear in my last video not about Protection we're just the good ones who doesn't wanna feel safe but there's a difference between wanting something and needing something so acts of love acts of service are not in themselves bad hide behind and then we're supposed to feel grateful for it this is patriarchy at work so this navigation sometimes women just have to do in order to survive and I've learnt that that's the only way that I'm gonna survive as a woman and the biggest mistruth of all about patriarchy a self fulfilling prophecy because of patriarchy and therefore by their own description so patriarchal bargaining is when women make choices cause it's all about like men earning more and men being protectors of us and really pick me is about saying whereby men get to become the protectors of a world that is unsafe why do women want these things but go back and watch my previous video on benevolent sexism between the genders they are navigating within the confines of a patriarchy but it's that we're told that we need them and will be incomplete without them where it keeps men in the position of power true chivalry should be about true respect and a genuine act of service it keeps women in need of Protection but here's where it gets spicy and being told by a more powerful and if we question it we're told we're just trying to be the nice guys women are going to really desire the Protection from associating with men because it does afford a level of Protection within patriarchy because you're incapable of providing it for yourself we know that so firstly who doesn't wanna feel cared for but they're trying to make choices that elevate their safety chivalry is not a leash unfortunately it's weaponized and it makes you look really insecure of that and then turn around and say we should be grateful okay so my friend Andrew here has asked
