What on earth am I wearing right now? What is this sorcery? How did I go from a stay at home mom covered in poop all day to this? Okay, this is the dress for the ladies who want to keep it classy but are still a little bit sassy, okay? Because. Okay, well, the booty. The booty is still there. I hate y'all. I hate sweater dresses with a passion. Everyone knows this about me. Because if you're a little thick or curvy or just had a baby like me, we don't want the added inches. They add, like, two extra inches to your already curvy body. This is like a suede, and it looks knit, but it's not. It's like a suede. Really light, really comfortable. I get claustrophobic. This is not claustrophobic whatsoever, y'all. $15 if you wanna feel like a woman tonight. Thank me later. The link is right there.
