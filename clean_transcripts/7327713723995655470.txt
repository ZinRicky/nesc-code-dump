there has been a really great conversation started by a creator on this app about the account Ballerina Farms please don't mind my hair by the way it's still wet and I have so many thoughts about this account but I I've gotta break this up into a couple videos so this is gonna be part 1 first and foremost trad wife accounts trad wife social media trends would not exist without white supremacy now I'm not calling ballerina pharma white supremacist so don't come for me I'm not accusing her of anything but if you wanna be a responsible consumer of media you have to look with a critical eye who these trad wife accounts are are overwhelmingly they are thin beautiful white women privileged wealthy white women and that is not an accident I follow plenty of homemaking accounts on this app that are women of color Latino women black women those accounts do not have the reach of these white homemaker account because when you talk about traditional housewives the optics of that is always a privileged white woman and the ideology of only a specific looking type of family Cishet white Christian is the ideal is a problem
