hey guys check this out I really enjoy puzzles but I've always complained to my wife of how much I hate building a puzzle on uneven surfaces or if you like you run out of time and it sits on the counter for a week it drives me nuts so my wife surprised me with this one day and let me tell you what this thing is awesome it has four different drawers two on each side to keep things separated for your OCD people and a nice smooth surface that is always easy to build on and easy to store
