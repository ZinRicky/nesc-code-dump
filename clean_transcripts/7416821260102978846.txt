we don't do backpacks around here we do bag bags for one simple reason because kids are nasty and they are a lot easier to clean I don't know what my son is doing wrong but his lunch box leaks every week and because I always pack them a ton of fresh fruit because their school's outside these bags are starting to smell like rotten fruit I have been trying to track down the source of the smell for the last couple of days and today I finally realized it was coming from these but the best part is it only took me less than five minutes to clean these things out I sprayed them with some all purpose cleaner wiped them with a rag and hose them down and I was I don't know about you but I think cleaning a backpack is a hack if you are on the go a lot or carting around smelly sports equipment get yourself one or two of these they are so worth it
