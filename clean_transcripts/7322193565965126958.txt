this is one thing that I am very happy with the way that I did it so we were not living together at the time he chose to move out to go live with some friends like to give me my space and I was like thank you much appreciated cause he was magically doing all the things that I wanted him to do now all of a sudden so when I asked him be at the house at Sunday morning at 9:00am you're gonna help me get the kids ready we're gonna go have breakfast as a family one last time we're not gonna tell them shit until we get home of course magically he was there on time dressed and blah blah blah help me with the kids with no problem everything was like it was the the fucking Sunday morning that I had always wished and dreamed we could have and it's only came once I'm threatening that I'm gonna leave so I was like okay I see I see what the fuck is going on here for the last fucking time I gotta get to my width end for you to fucking show up for me no I'm good like you know that fucking weekend song sing my mind cause baby I would die for you I don't need you to fucking die for me I need you to show up on time for me do you know what I mean that fucking song drives me fucking crazy but anyway in the last ditch effort Homie was doing everything I needed him to do so we took the kids out to breakfast to a little diner and I was like order whatever you want whatever you want we're just gonna have a good day we're you know whatever they were like can we get pancakes I was like yes pancakes double if you want eggs and pancakes like there's no money restrictions like just enjoy yourself we're just gonna have fun you know school is starting soon cause we did it in the summer I was like school starting soon we're just gonna have one fun last little morning together and that's what we did they were like what like and I took a picture right when they realized how fun of a morning it was and they were like what what orange juice and hot chocolate what what I took a picture of them because I was like I just wanted to capture that moment of of innocence that I knew was soon gonna be changed for them their life is not fucking over just a little bit different and in my opinion better and in their opinion now five years later they're good with it so as soon as we came home we said hey guys before we kind of disperse and go about our day and start playing and stuff we just wanna have a small conversation we had the conversation where we explained you know we're mommy and daddy here you know just like how boyfriends and girlfriends have relationships mommy and daddy are kinda like a boyfriend and girlfriend we just also have kids so we're like boyfriend and girlfriend but also family and so the family part doesn't change but the boyfriend girlfriend part is the part we wanna like just kinda separate a little bit so daddy's gonna live somewhere else Mommy's gonna live somewhere else and we're all you know we're still your mommy and daddy we're still gonna you know everything's gonna be okay okay like that's of course the story we told them I wish that is how it remains but whatever that's another story if you wanna hear the story in even greater detail I do have a podcast it's called Emerging Motherhood it's available literally everywhere podcasts are available it's usually about 30 minute long episodes but I knew if I told my kids we were getting a divorce I would never go back on them like that was the final straw like that for me that was a line it could not cross I can't look at my children and lie to them I cannot break their little hearts and then be like just kidding so he knew and I knew like there's lines that I don't cross and I had never told the kids before that we were gonna get separated so um for me that was a big step and that really solidified it in my heart but then on purpose I was like we are moving on and now I'm gonna go on a date you're gonna watch the kids and I'm gonna like go out and I like stuck to my motherfucking guns because if I didn't put myself in those positions I knew I would end up falling back so I had to like cross some lines that like even I had do you know what I mean like I knew if I go on a date while I'm married like this marriage means nothing we like one of us has stepped out of the marriage even though that person was me like so I did start dating like as I was married not healthy not great don't recommend it I did a lot of shit wrong but I did need to just kinda get just shake him off you know what I mean so I wish you all the luck in the world sending you so much love
