if you are a new mom or about to become a new mom please listen to this before I became a mom I wish somebody would have told me these things number one starting out with whoever you decide is going to be a part of your birth space please don't let the opinions of others um change out for you or make like other people making you feel bad for not including them in your birthplace this is your time you are about to birth a baby it is your decision on who has to be there or not don't let anyone else tell you otherwise number two is don't let anybody convince you that you need to leave your baby um when I was postpartum people were like you gotta leave your baby like let's go here like no ma'am first of all I breastfed exclusively breastfed so that wasn't even an option and I didn't wanna do that anyways um so don't let anybody convince you that you gotta leave your baby I feel like the first year um it is completely normal to be on your baby 24 7 and totally good as well so don't anybody tell you otherwise don't let anyone tell you that you're holding your baby too much because it's completely normal it is completely um good for you good for them for like hold your baby and another thing that goes into that too is people always feel entitled to hold your baby those first few months if you don't want people to hold you baby you don't have to let them I'm just letting you know you don't have to let them like you could be the one what I did is I baby war um and do did all those things to avoid people asking to hold my baby because I didn't wanna do that um those first few months like you just wanna like breastfeed your baby you want your baby on you you wanna be skin to skin you wanna be doing contact now also your baby doesn't want a stranger holding them they just don't so yeah I just wanna post this as a reminder because when you're postpartum people and you're when you're pregnant you feel kinda vulnerable and people kinda like take advantage of that to try to get you to you know now hold your boundaries so keep holding those boundaries and keep doing what you think is best because at the end of the day you carry that baby and that's your baby and you just you can hold the boundaries and you can say no and yeah
