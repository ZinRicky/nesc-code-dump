he didn't really give me a straight answer and I think it's because I was kinda like it's in six months I'm not even gonna really start thinking about it right now anyway I just know that when my lease is up I'm definitely moving definitely not gonna live with the roommate I have now and things are gonna change and then I did also make it clear like since I've invited you to move in with me and we spend all of our time together anyway if you choose not to move in with me that's fine but I'm definitely not gonna do like this sleepovers at your house anymore cause that shit is exhausting I do it now cause I don't really love being here when my kids aren't here cause I just have a shitty roommate that I don't really like like used to be kinda cool shit kinda just fell apart he's going through some life shit he's you know he's got all kinds of shit going on that I'm like cool dude this just means like when Lisa's up we go our separate ways so yeah I don't know it didn't really give me a straight answer and I don't really wanna ask again or bring it up cause I genuinely think he's thinking about it uh this is one of the first he he came out of a really long relationship so this is one of the first times he's lived alone in a long time so I think he's enjoying that too so I don't know a lot of shits up in the and it is like six months away so I think it was I did kind of like soft ball throw it to him so we'll see
