prenups and should your woman sign one my answer may surprise you my name is Hallie and as you all know I am a traditional wife and stay at home mother but I also used to work in financial advising and I still dabble in it here and there on the side if you are marrying a man who comes from a legacy a family that has built an empire or a trust fund and it was his grandfather's money or his father's money absolutely yes I do think you should try a prenup without any qualm you don't have to be insulted by it because it wasn't his money it was his family and if it was my son I would expect the same damn thing no matter who he loved or who he chose to marry I would say there needs to be a prenup in place because it's not his money it is theirs and remember guys these prenups have contingencies they they there's a lot of breath to the subject a prenup can include and disclude many many things it's not just hey if we divorce you get nothing that's absolutely not a prenup is so before you ask these questions definitely research the the breath of this topic second if you are his second wife or third wife and he has a family with five kids hundred percent you should sign the damn prenup and not ask questions well obviously ask questions read the contract but you don't have to be offended at it because he has a family with someone else he has an empire that he already built most likely I laugh when men wanna talk about prenups when nine out of 10 times they have no business even talking about them because they don't make that much honey you're talking the elite 10% and we live in 2024 honey there are a lot of amazing women there who have built empires and businesses and they're successful and they may want you to sign a prenup and that's acceptable as well but regarding men at the end of the day oh that was my Insta pot I'm just gonna let it finish doing its thing back to my point I see a lot of men that are no doubt still sleeping on their mama's couches that are watching the far side of the atmosphere YouTube videos like fresh and fit podcast her like every woman needs to shine to sign a prenup because they're sweeping the court floors with men nowadays honey sit your ass back down you don't have anything I get it we overcompensated from modern feminism there is now a far right side I don't even know if you can call it right side but side of the manosphere where some of these men are just angry and bitter and resentful and I don't blame it we've had a lot of women that were like that in the past two but we've overcompensated and we swung too far and now we gotta find a balance but my point is don't be throwing out words like prenup when you don't have anything if you are in your first marriage it's your first like relationship y'all are young you're building from scratch there's no reason to even consider or even think about things like prenup unless of course you really just do wanna make the possibility of divorce easier which obviously I don't really promote my husband and I have built everything together and I mean he's built the business while I have taken care of what I need to hear so that he could focus on that fully but I wasn't his second wife he didn't already have an existing family and he wasn't a trust fund baby so there was no need for talk like Prina questions kill me because I think people talk about something they have no knowledge about but yeah those are my thoughts it's very circumstantial every couple is different I don't promote making divorce easier but there is a time and a place for a prenup for both men and women thank you for joining my late night talk
