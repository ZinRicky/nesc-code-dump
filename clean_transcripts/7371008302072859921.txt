the women who have had the most diabolical lies told to you how many of you are sitting here now this is a message for the Kansas City Chiefs PR team so if you're not the Kansas City Chiefs you can keep scrolling when are you gonna come out with a statement about Harrison Bucker's commencement address because all I'm hearing is silence and we all know that silence is complicity so are the Kansas City Chiefs happy to sit complicit in this sentence do they agree with the statements that but commade do you agree that women should be relegated to the home rather than pursue their careers and their aspirations as a priority or they just happy to profit handsomely off of women who have not only pursued their dreams and aspirations but have done so to be the top of their game not because of but in spite of their association with men and continue to profit off of said aspirational woman or would you have preferred that Taylor Swift herself have been relegated to the home because now you got a whole bunch of new fans and you got a whole bunch more eyes on you and that means you have a new responsibility and time is ticking and I haven't heard anything from you about how you're gonna address this new responsibility you have because you now have a whole bunch of new fans and majority of your new fans are women and they deserve to feel safe and included in the fandom if you want them that's great but it comes with responsibility and if you wanna come at me about why bring Taylor Swift into this I was the one who did that he did it he decided to quote her out of context I'm guessing without permission calling her someone's girlfriend quoting her words as if it's not the most ironic thing ever to quote the most arguably successful woman in the world right in the same breath as you're telling women everywhere to sit down be quiet and go back to the kitchen so this is what I'm gonna say we the women believe that Harrison Butler needs to be disciplined for what he said because what he said was hate speech it was hate speech against the LGBTQA+ community and it was misogynistic it was misogynism at play that is how misogyny presents it presents in contextually inappropriate declarations paternalistic declarations talking down to people who are celebrating what might be one of the most important days of their entire life separating out women in that moment as a special group that you need to speak down not acknowledging your privilege or the fact that as a man as a white man as a white straight man well not sure how straight he really is as a white closeted man as a white closeted man from the religious community with a lot of money and a lot of power in a public profile you're choosing to use and abuse that power to speak down to a group of people who you will never understand who you will never understand their struggle it is embarrassing and it is hateful and you deserve to be punished so Kansas City Chiefs I would love you to consider speaking out making a statement and disciplining the man who's put us all through it over the last few day
