she may be thin but to me wicked will always be fat representation and what I mean by that is if you changed green skin with fatness would this still work and in my opinion absolutely yes obviously spoilers ahead this story to me is just so relatable because Elphabas biggest plight is her green skin it is the first thing people see when they see her it is the way that they judge her so there's two instances where she meets people for the first time and she sees their their looks at her with like shock or disgust she goes no I'm not seasick yes I've always been green no I didn't eat grass as a child already like explaining the questions that she gets regularly because of her outer appearance and it felt so painfully relatable to me as a fat person having to justify and explain my fatness where I say yes I've always been fat yes I've tried to diet no I'm not eating 10,000 calories a day and I'm I'm doing this thing where I'm like explaining and justifying my body size and watching that on screen it was like yeah that's done I've done that I'm not that girl where she's watching the guy that she loves like walk away because he's in love with the thin blonde girl you know you like I'm I'm not that girl I'm never gonna be that girl and as a fat person like and even if there's like a connection you're like I'm never gonna be that girl again so painfully relatable but just in general her entire storyline of like her skin is the only thing people ever see of her and obviously again this could be I think any person who is on the outside can relate to just her her storyline about like all she's ever wanted she dreams of meeting the wizard so that he can degreenify her me I used to pray to god every night that he would make me thin every single night I used to pray that I would wake up in a different body in elphabas song the wizard and I she's excited to be the wizard because he's going to degreenify her and she said what I've waited for since since birth to not be green anymore he'll he's gonna grant that to her and she goes by my looks he won't be blinded and then she says he'll say to me I see who you truly are my whole life will change this desire to be like truly truly seen for who you are not just on the outside but on the inside and hoping that something magical can just come here and change your outside so that people can actually see your inside like that that I believe is a quintessential fat experience you know to me that that song is is always like painful and cathartic to listen to because it's just it's just so relatable because I used to pray I'm like I'm a good person I'm kind if people just got to know me if they weren't so small minded and they look past my size and they actually got to know me they would see that I'm I'm a good person you know so yes like her plight is being green mine is being fat but it just it feels so relatable and in the movie the add scenes with young Elphaba um and beginning when she getting bullied by some kids and like shitty relationship with her parents again like all very relatable but when she sing Defying Gravity she's like falling down and there's like kind of a mirror down the the building and she's she's falling and she sees the younger version of herself and she reaches out and in to me that was her like finally accepting herself and like you know her greenness and I have such a connection to my younger self and a lot of things that I do now are for my younger self who was so unhappy and uncomfortable in her body and thought that all she needs to do is change to be accepted and then getting to a point where you realize I'm actually okay the way that I am and either I will be or I won't be accepted but I'm good my greatest dream is no longer to change what I look like on the outside um so obviously every time I watch Defying Gravity oh violent violent tears um anyways this story will always mean so so much to me she might not be fat but to me this truly is phenomenal fat representation um and I feel really represented when I see her on screen um and I'm really excited that this film exists and we're gonna have a movie to watch it I don't have to go to Broadway to see the story (I recommend going at least once though!) and I loved it and I can't wait for part two
