okay so I'm not trying to accuse Kate of anything but every time I see one of these videos and she's like pouring a pound of salt all over the frozen like chicken noodle soup or fish and chips it makes me think about how before no fault divorce which in America they're trying to take away no fault divorce before no fault divorce when a woman could not get a divorce she would just slowly poison her husband cause you know she was cooking all his meals so she would just slowly poison him just like slowly kill him and um I'm not trying to accuse Kate of anything I'm sure she's a lovely woman she works very hard to feed her blue collar husband but I don't know makes me think of that
