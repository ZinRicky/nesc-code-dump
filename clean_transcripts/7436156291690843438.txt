how is misogyny different than the patriarchy and how are those different from sexism and let's also talk about Shrek the patriarchy women are subordinate to men there's like a gendered hierarchy just like how in Shrek the fairy tale creatures are subordinate to the human like characters misogyny is the mechanism it's like the tools that we use to sustain the patriarchy it's how we keep people in line in Shrek and in real life they're using laws they're using policies to enforce this subordination social stigma and pressures and policing is also another mechanism to ensure that people are acting according to their gender or fairytale creature characterness and sexism is the belief that is justifying the misogyny and the patriarchy belief that ogres are just naturally smelly they are naturally less than they naturally belong in swamps weâ€™re using that belief system to justify keeping them in the swamps and treating them differently keep in mind that the misogyny that you face as a fairy tale creature may look very different depending on what type of fairy tale creature you are I don't know I'm still going on with this analogy basically women are not treated monolithically so the type of misogyny that you face is going to look very different if you are a white woman or a woman of color or you have a disability or based on your class or based on your sexual orientation things like that and feminism is an ideology that pursues the Equality of the sexes
