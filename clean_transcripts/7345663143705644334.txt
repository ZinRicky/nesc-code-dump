When I recently found out that my husband's favourite pie is lemon meringue, I knew that I had to make him one. With only a few lemons left on my tree, I got to work immediately. I started by making a crust using an all purpose eincorn flour that's bursting with nutrients and flavor since it hasn't been stripped to stay soft stable. There's just nothing like a flaky, buttery crust. Which is why I won't be using a freshly milled 100% whole grain ironcorn for this one. I got two Crestwell Freeze one for another pie. My chickens are laying eggs again and you're not going to believe how orange the yolks are. Which comes my commitment to raise them on fresh pasta aka new backyard grass daily. I don't use cornstarch in my kitchen. Instead, the all purpose ironcorn thickened up the lemon custard perfectly. After tempering the egg yolks with the lemon custard, I finished my pie crust by baking it with a layer of Parchment foil and beans to keep from collapsing during the pre bake. The last step was to make my merengue, which was really fun to do and I'm actually a new fan of meringue. This entire pie was very lightly sweetened with maple sugar and all of the ingredients are nutrient dense, mostly from my land. So when my husband took a bite his first words were oh my gosh, this is the best one yet, honey!
