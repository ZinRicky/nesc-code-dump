the thing is I don't care if I'm actually delusional I spent my entire childhood hating myself my entire adolescence hating myself I spent my entire life basically um not being okay in my body and thinking that I there was nothing wrong with me because I was fat and now I literally I'm bare faced minus this gloss and I genuinely look at the mirror and I'm like this is I'm so beautiful like what do you mean I'm just this I'm just I'm so beautiful I'm sunburned I haven't showered in two days and I'm looking myself and I'm like wow I am so beautiful and I am going to allow myself to feel that way and I don't really care if it's true or delusion because I got a good pair of yitties I got a nice face I got good lips I got beautiful hair like I have good style I am allowing myself to feel good and comfortable and confident because I spent so many years not feeling that way and now I'm gonna make up for it you know I'm gonna make up for all the time that I didn't like myself by being so utterly obsessed with myself it makes people angry that is my goal and nobody can tell me shit sorry sorry
