I thought I was so organized and planned so well for today but I failed my son has speech therapy at 10:00am on Mondays so I thought okay if I do an 8:00am doctor's appointment I would get that out of the way and then speech therapy and then we can start our homeschool and have a normal week like start our week off really well my children are on vacation so therefore there is no speech therapy I could have slept in but instead I booked a freaking 8:00am on a Monday morning appointment who does that
