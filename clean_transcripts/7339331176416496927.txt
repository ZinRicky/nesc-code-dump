the broader implications of this ruling is not something that most people understand and it's not even something that most journalists are reporting on I'm the feminist lawyer I'm a litigator and reproductive justice expert and I wanna talk about what this has to do with fetal personhood, the law, and pregnancy criminalization. The fetal personhood movement wants to establish that fetuses and embryos have their own individual constitutional rights. during his presidency Trump put literally hundreds of Christian right wing judges on district court And appellate benches. anti choice activists and organizations have been bringing these cases in front of these judges some of who have embraced fetal personhood type language or in the case of the Alabama Supreme Court have completely adopted it we're all seeing in real time the consequences of a fetal personhood future so like how do you have IVF if all embryos and fetuses have constitutional rights clinics can't operate knowing that they might have homicide charges brought against them if something happens to some of the embryos and couples often discard embryos they don't end up using it gets a lot worse so if they're successful bringing this to other states or god forbid at a federal level there would be no exception I mean it would be a complete outright abortion ban in all of the United States because of a fetus or an embryo has constitutional rights there is no situation in which you could obtain an abortion Now stick with me here this is all a part of a much broader effort to end democratic measures around reproductive rights what I mean by that is that most Americans support abortion access it is driving a lot of voters to the poll and in a lot of states even red states were seeing very successful ballot initiatives to protect abortion in their state constitutions now Republicans in the anti choice movement know this so they wanna make sure that this is an issue that we can keep out of the people's hands so if they were to able to get say the United States Supreme Court to rule that under the Constitution fetuses and embryos have constitutional rights there would be nothing that um Congress couldn't you know enact legislation protecting abortion because that would then be in violation of the Constitution so if more states enact fetal personhood legislation or courts adopt fetal personhood we're gonna see skyrocketing of pregnancy criminalization which is already a phenomenon in the United States even right now there are women who are imprisoned because of their miscarriages because the prosecutor argued that she caused her own miscarriage would become so much more prevalent in a fetal personhood future where prosecutors would argue that women violated their embryos and fetuses constitutional rights she was you know an addict during pregnancy she had a poor diet she didn't exercise enough you know maybe she had a stillborn or miscarriage in the same argument that we're seeing right now that she did something to cause it it wasn't a miscarriage it was an abortion and all of this is a part of a much broader effort to ensure that women cannot participate equally in society and democracy it is an effort for the patriarchy to try to take back more control over reproduction to ensure that women cannot decide when they become pregnant how they become pregnant and if they remain pregnant which is why we're seeing increased attacks and contraception right now and recreational seggs but I need to pause here so I'll save that for another video let me know in the comments if you have any questions and what your thoughts are
