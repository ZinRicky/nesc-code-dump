okay so I don't really know if there's like a very big um religious or spiritual leftist side of TikTok but I wanna know from people who might have like um I don't know some kind of like knowledge about the universe and why it is the way it is like I am wondering if there are any like spiritual explanations behind why everything is so bad like the horrors we all know what's going on in the world right now I don't need to list it um for fear of getting censored but yeah like it doesn't even have to be explicitly religious or spiritual maybe it's a more philosophical thing um and I think there's a lot of explanation as to what we should do about it like what our obligation is as people in the world um like what we should do in the face of evil but what are the explanations behind why there is so much evil like on a spiritual level you know like we can call it god we can call it the universe like how is it that this is all just like fucking allowed to happen
