you know I've never fully understood why women dangle intimacy time to their partners to get what they want in fact I kind of find it controlling Donâ€™t get me wrong, I get it in a joking way like oh take out the garbage, clean the house, and then we can play. But don't you wanna live in the moment and give to your partner freely, and not just dangle it as a reward? Not only that, maybe they would do those chores for you without you even having to ask.
