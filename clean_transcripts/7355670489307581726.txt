My kids aren't picky eaters at all, but they do love chicken, so I decided to make them one of their favorite meals for dinner, roast chicken. I wasn't about to make a grocery trip, so to elevate this simple go to meal, I decided to make some homemade sourdough croutons with the cabbage and dipping I had chopped a few days before when the salad and dressing were prepped. I pop the salad back in the fridge to make sure it would be cold and crisp when I serve it, since my husband loves it like that. I then got started with the croutons by chopping a several day old sourdough sandwich bread loaf into 1 to 2 inch cubes and topping them with olive oil, salt, thyme, and oregano. There's for about 20 minutes and then I finished by slicing the chicken, which literally was falling off the bone because it had been slow cooked all day. I reserved the nutrient rich broth for soups and cooking. Grains are like yams. While my family waited at the dinner table, I toss the salad with hot croutons and a pineapple vinaigrette and serve dinner with a side of purple sauerkraut that I'd allowed to ferment for about one month. This dinner was easy and very delicious.
