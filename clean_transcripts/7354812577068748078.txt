If you wanna be a good friend then you should never make this mistake. If your friend is going through some troubles with their man or woman and they're opening up to you about it. Then here's what you should never do. You should never tell them to break up with said partner. You are there as a friend to let them feel comfortable and open up to you. But you're not a marriage counselor. So you truly don't know the extent of their relationship. One thing I've learned is, it doesn't matter how bad the relationship is your friend needs to make that decision for themself. Not only that half the time they're not gonna listen to you. How many of your friends or yourself have you seen go back to their ex? or make excuses for them and go back? You shouldn't get mad at your friend for making their mistakes. Maybe it's not a mistake Maybe those two people can really grow. At the end of the day if you wanna be a good friend you should never tell your friends what to do. You should just be there for support and my god just stop telling them to break up and run the first time they have troubles because that's not how relationships work.
