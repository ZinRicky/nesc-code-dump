I grew up most of my life living by this one cardinal rule and I was under the impression that everybody followed this rule I thought that everybody's mom taught them this The one cardinal rule is “if you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say it at all” I'm kind of shocked either some people weren't raised this way or they're just forgetting the basic manners of life it doesn’t feel good to be mean does it? What does that really say about yourself Momma always told me Anything someone says that's mean to you is just a projection of themselves it doesn't reflect who you are, but them. This world is absolutely crazy and unhinged, why on earth would you try to spread more hate? Anybody who's truly happy in life doesn't have energy to waste on being negative and if they don't have anything nice to say they skip, they filter what they take in Maturing is realizing that you do not have to react to every little thing Listen to your mama y'all if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it at all🫶🏼
