I'm already ready for bed but I wanted to answer this the rest of this comment reads how do you prepare children for a world that won't change for them this is such a unique example because I was also somebody who froze in conflict the difference was I was screamed at as a kid so I don't necessarily think that being screamed at prepares you for arguing because generally parents that scream at the kids are not allowing conversation dialogue or arguments coming back their direction and the reality is yeah my kids are gonna come up against people who treat them badly in life I don't expect that coaches teachers employers friends bosses etcetera are gonna treat them like their mom but I'm also not gonna scream at them or bully them in order for them to get practice with that my kids are actually way better at arguing than I ever was as a kid because I allow them to challenge my decisions and come up with the reasons why they wanna make their point logical arguments will always be heard in my house and I think that will prepare them well for the future
