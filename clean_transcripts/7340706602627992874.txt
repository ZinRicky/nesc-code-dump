one thing people are conflating is a stay at home mom and trad wife those are two different things a trad wife is fucking trapped and they are living these traditional gender roles that are assigned from the Lord God himself so when you don't cook that dinner you're not just disappointing your family you're letting down your god you know what I mean a stay at home mom has a loving partner the two of you have come to this decision and have set some boundaries and rules and it's like your own little thing that you guys are doing because this works for your family you're like hey I'm willing to stay at home and take care of the kids while you can go and work but we're gonna have these things in place to live that life a tribe wife is a fucking slave by design from your Lord and Saviour they're very different very fucking different
