so I've started making these videos about anti Semitism from a progressive and Liberal standpoint because I think it could bridge the gap in understanding between people who are super far left who are very pro Palestine um and people who are just literally trying to exist as Jewish people now no community is a monolith and the way I feel about my Jewishness and and Judaism in general and the state of Israel is not gonna be the way that every Jewish person feels about it so I'm not speaking for the entire community but I am speaking for myself um and for a lot of progressive Jewish people this sort of commentary and you can click this comment and go back and see kind of like the thread there's a couple statements that are commonly made 1 why is everything anti Semitic 2 um this person said the word anti Semitism has lost all of its meaning because it's being overused to describe things that are not anti Semitic however those things that are not anti Semitic are being called not anti Semitic by people who are not Jewish people and when we're talking about bigotry it is very often um important to let the people in the marginalized communities decide what does harm to the community and what doesn't because we are just a much more uh into an insensitive to it and we are much more well versed in the historical significance of a lot of these like common tropes stereotypes I started talking about them in the video that this comment was made from some of the commentary I'm getting back from people who are willfully unwilling to hear this perspective is that anti Semitism is becoming a bigger issue because of Jewish people and the long and short of it is anti Semitism is a form of bigotry that has been around since like biblical times this is not new and anti Semitism didn't become a problem for the Jewish community with the inception of the state of Israel nor with the current goings on in the Middle East but much like the conversations about racism in the United States need to start off with a baseline understanding that our entire system is racist and most people have inherent bias just because of the way that our country and western civilization was based on colorism it's very important to understand that conversations about antisemitism have to have a foundational understanding of how nefarious and widespread antisemitism has always been within culture especially popular culture it is a long history it is a nuanced history but it is the baseline for having modern and impactful conversations
