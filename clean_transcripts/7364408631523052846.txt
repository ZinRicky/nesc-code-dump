Today, in attempting to avoid the responsible things that I have to do, I decided to replant pots. There's plenty of other things I should be doing. I have four kids I need to provide and work for, but I decided to replant. Possible account. They say, like, this big guy, he was falling over. This little guy just needed a bigger pot because he's growing. This guy needed to get out of the water he was propagating in. And the pot is already too small, but it better than water. And this guy was also falling over. And there's my computer where I should be working. But we have plants.
