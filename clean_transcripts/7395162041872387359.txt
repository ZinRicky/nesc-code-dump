brothers and sisters my heart's desire and prayer to god concerning them is for their salvation for everyone who calls in the name of the Lord will be saved in the book of Romans we see that the Israelites are still ignorant to the righteousness of god they're still working hard to keep the law of Moses to gain righteousness and save themselves but here's the thing the law our good works doing all the right things it was never going to save us because our righteousness our redemption our salvation is through Jesus Christ alone his work on the cross was the perfect fulfillment the only victory we have of our sin and death his perfect life allows us to have salvation through faith alone we're gonna screw up we're gonna fail we are imperfect humans but Christ is perfect and because of him we have salvation
