The other day, when my husband and I were talking about our childhood favorite candies, he mentioned that he was obsessed with Jolly Ranchers, but he hasn't had them in a while, so I decided to make him some today. His favorite flavors are apple and watermelon, so that's what we went with. I started by combining some water, sugar, and corn syrup. Brought that to 310 degrees, and then I added in my watermelon extract, some malic acid, some pink color. This is the stage where I had to work very quickly because my mixture began to harden. So I poured that into my silicone molds before moving on to my second flavor, which was green apple. So I added some apple extract, malic acid, and green color this time before pouring it into my remaining molds. After about an hour and a half to two hours, my Jolly Ranchers had hardened, so I popped them out and transferred them over to a bowl. These are so nostalgic to him, so I was really excited for him to try. I ended up preferring the apple ones where he preferred the watermelon ones, but before the day was over, the bowl was gone.
