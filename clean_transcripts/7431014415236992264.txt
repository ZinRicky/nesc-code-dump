most important thing in people's lives and their greatest accomplishment should not be their children Chloe and I agree but let's talk about why the idea that especially for women your greatest accomplishment in life should be your children is outdated my mom raised me to know that she was a woman first and a mother second she would tell me you're not my greatest achievement never mess me up or offended me I understood that she was just tryna raise us girls to understand that even if we didn't have children we weren't missing out we weren't not fulfilling our best selves or not we we weren't purposeless that we could go and do anything and having children might be one of those things might be one really amazing thing and it might not be and she never wanted us to feel limited but that's what that kind of sentiment does it does limit women I'm gonna explain why I'm Doctor Zoe I have a PhD in feminism and I really wanna talk about this women are expected to say that having children is their biggest accomplishment in life and we have these Women's weekends every year in my family and the women like share their biggest accomplishments we do cards we do like d and m's and the women always say like my biggest accomplishment's my children my mom's always said like mine isn't and everyone in the room's always kind of a bit like did you really say that especially back in the day you know it was a shocking thing to say but what is an amazing profound experience I imagine I mean I have my fur baby so I can imagine uh it is not the Beal and endor but people rarely tell men that their greatest accomplishment in life should be having a child has anyone ever asked you if your greatest accomplishment in life should be having a child no ha ha when we continue to normalise this statement what we're doing is perpetuating this limited idea of womanhood that unless you do experience being a mother that you will not achieve your biggest uh I guess you won't be a fulfilled complete person do you feel like you were your mom's greatest achievement no are you offended by the content of this TikTok as a man no no
