I just stopped a near parenting disaster okay I'm dropping my kids off for their math class and my daughter has a water bottle and I look at it and I see her crawling out of the car out of the corner of my eye and I was like huh what water bottle is that and she shows me which one it is and I was like oh no baby you can't take that you can use it at home can't take it to a place with other children or other adults this is the water bottle can you imagine the questions or the call I would have gotten if she had taken that in with her oh my god
