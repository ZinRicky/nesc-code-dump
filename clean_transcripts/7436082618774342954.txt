I'm obviously extremely disappointed in the results but it is clear that there will be a second Trump presidency it is really uh on my heart this morning to say that as a man but more importantly as a black man that this country does not deserve black women or black people but specifically black women this morning I woke up and I just gave my wife a hug because I know how heavy this is weighing on black women and they have carried this country and save this country too many times and continue to be the most disrespected human beings on the planet and it quite frankly it disgusts me I'm thinking about the world that we're going to bring outdoor into in a few months and I want the vice president to know uh that her and her team did everything right in the right way but the unfortunate reality is that this country is still steeped in racism sexism and misogyny I am personally proud of her and I know that so many others are the same we appreciate her tenacity her focus her decency and how she handle herself throughout this campaign and I don't wanna hear anybody saying that they should have been something different she should have been running longer the fact is is that they did everything that a campaign can do and more but we as a country really had a lot of have a lot of soul searching to do and that's really what I wanna say about that today but I want black women to hear from me to know that as a black man I'm gonna triple my efforts to lift them up to make sure that they're supported to make sure that they're seen and to make sure that other folks are challenging to understanding that they alone can't be the soul of this democracy and that they alone can't save us from ourselves time and time again they alone can be the people they show up in and show up in such a way that folks who are voting against their own best interest uh that they are saved as well they can't do it anymore and we have to be there to understand that reality and lift them up
