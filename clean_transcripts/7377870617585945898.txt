Never carry in your purse. Wanna wear a dress this summer, but need a secure place to carry and for your cellphone? I wear dresses all summer long, and I actually hate carrying a purse. These shorts may hit perfect to have my cellphone on me at all times. And when I need to carry, I can securely carry. Even when I'm sitting down, I can still grab things out of my shorts. Now I have these shorts to wear under all my dresses. I don't have to only wear dresses with pockets.
