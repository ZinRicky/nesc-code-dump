along with us to see how a day with dad looks like Madison and I are actually very similar in the way that we think we get distracted way too easily on the simplest of decks so as you can see here we did a lot more than just a haircut we actually arrived 30 minutes before the haircut place even opened so we decided to kill some time we decided to walk around Target Bells and Petco all purchasing things that we didn't actually need at any of those stores but we had fun doing it anyway Maverick was actually obsessed with one piece of artwork from bells that he wanted me to buy it was a sparkly pink cowboy boot stomping on the earth super strange but finally we actually made it to sports clip and because men are creatures of habit we always go to the same sports clip and get the same girls and yes Mavericks girl finally decided to talk him into getting a real Mohawk and he is so proud of that dang thing I'm pretty sure he's actually gonna go to bed with gel still in his hair um but that's okay so the kids had fun with dad and all before the 1:00 football game
