women have been lied to, and the worst part is it's .coming from other women The belief that “if he wanted to he would” that's actually the worst advice We hear it all the time and it's literally a joke at this point. so I asked my dad, uncle, and brother what they thought about this, and their response genuinely surprised me. Their response was it's simply not true because most of the time they literally don't know. Unless you're direct and communicate your needs, they don't understand this, half the time they don't understand how to meet your needs Not only that some men have never been given examples of how to treat a woman properly they're figuring out life just like we are The saying should really go “if you want him to, you should tell him” Directly, and I mean directly as possible You want him to text you “good morning beautiful”? TELL HIM to! if you want him to get you flowers, tell him to! if you want him to grab you coffee in the morning or just surprise you in general, tell him to! want him to pump your gas? then tell him directly and tell them your needs Don’t wait later down the road and compare your relationship with other people for all you know they're probably just really good at communicating their wants and needs How do we expect them to know if we don't tell them? Take initiative and speak directly if you want your man to surprise you with gifts, flowers, or do pleasant things for you. If you want your needs met, speak directly, communicate, it's that simple.
