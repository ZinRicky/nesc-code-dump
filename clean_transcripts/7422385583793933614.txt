we just moved into our new house and I have a lot of unpacking to do so I'm going to pop on an audiobook and get myself motivated to do this but I like my books a little smutty and I have little ears around so I am going to pop in my open your headphones I really like these because I can listen to my audiobook and still have an ear out for the kids but they do not hear what I am listening to these go around the ear they fit really nicely and they sit on top of your ear instead of going in like normal earbuds they're really comfy great audio so now I can enjoy my Smut and listen to the kids and my audiobook at the same time
