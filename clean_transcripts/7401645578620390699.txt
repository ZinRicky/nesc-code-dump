Why is nobody talking about this? Men are better at golf than women for this one simple reason. Women cannot find golf balls to save their lives. As soon as it's in the air, it's as good as gone. Meanwhile, men can somehow track their golf ball that they hit over 200 yards. Just say what you want, disagree if you want. Men are just better at golf.
