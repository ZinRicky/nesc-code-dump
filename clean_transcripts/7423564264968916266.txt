as of the 6:00 Hurricane update the Hurricane has shifted south and that means we are going to be getting more storm search than we had originally planned my husband owns a marine construction company and so we do like docks and book lists and they moved the barges like downriver farther so it was could withstand the 4 to 6 feet storm surge we were going to get but now we're predicted like 6 to 12 feet so it cannot withstand that so my husband had to go and get the barges out of the water it's 8 o'clock at night there's obviously no lights very not great conditions but the wind is supposed to pick up tomorrow morning which makes it even more unsafe so tonight was the only option so he had to pause bookshelf building to go take care of work stuff but kids and I are here and now I'm stress cleaning my whole house I can't handle this part of the Hurricane prep
