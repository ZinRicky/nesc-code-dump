I do not organise activities when my friends have playdates over and apparently this is a controversial motherhood take my daughter has a friend over today and I'm just letting them do their thing free rein you know the rules like you're almost 10 you're you're good you're on your own I'll make lunch I'll make snacks I'll help you open things um but I'm not producing the fun but apparently I'm the only one like when I send my kids to other people's houses they're like yeah we made model robots and we went to the zoo the playdates the activity I must have missed a whole chapter in mom lessons or something because I thought the whole point of having another kid over is so that they would like just play with their stuff and entertain each other don't get me wrong I love that for the other moms you wanna bake cookies with my kid with like 5 other kids over have a blast I'm like usually using that time to catch up on chores and laundry I don't know where do you follow this discussion like when your kids have friends over do you have preset activities that you know that you're gonna like bring out for them to do or do you just let them like be kids and have free rein of the house and like their toys let me know in the comments because if I'm the only one who just lets them do it I'm gonna start coming up with like an itinerary
