and I think like as feminist Yumi Stein and Clementine Ford were the prominent feminist panellist you know how to handle a situation like this um I've heard that some of them left um and I kinda wanna go so what do they do so there's a dominant narrative that feminists are like and kind of advertized it as like a special secret male guest they secretly invited Jack still um this is the top tier of feminism in this country the audience didn't have consent um and remembering how sacred these faces are um I think the other level of this is like there were comments made about consent and I don't know if that was like a Band Aid PR move or what that was about um but when you're looking at the specific feminist space as a concept but basically like comedy at the expense of those issues and in this case and their trust as well but I think that the idea was like because you're gonna feel like these issues that are very serious um on the back of a feminist brand that you build to kind of like make the feminist panel as um um and what this was a part of his uh cause these are sensitive topics that are very much real and very much present you know you do get a certain level of desensitised to these issues we really like they probably got paid for it there would have been people who are genuinely going there for answers and it's very raw still for them you must get brand deals no I and I think like it just kind of for me brings up the fact of like where I stand and this is why I personally choose to there is a group a comedy duo of men but um you need to create a really safe space to do that and I think that um any criticism of this event is gonna further keep having those conversations with your community oh yeah chicks did consent and like took mouth the glass ceiling um have an expectation that they will be safe spaces um based off as TikTok creators there's not gonna be individual solutions to a social structural problem I just I don't wanna sell out but it just does bring up these women raised me and what was happening in that event was a violation of that trust and there would have been lots of survivors in the room onto the panel to film um how where the line is around this so what happened I'm Doctor Zoe and I think that this whole story is really funny as possible the panellists did know that he was coming um they wanted these feminists to basically put on this event it's obvious that they've picked a feminist panel um like these are the women who I've looked up to I don't know that there is a feminist product um and where your line is around selling um but you've gotta realise that the audience have come there under false pretences cause when you build a feminist voice new show get an earpiece in awkward and embarrassing um in the context of construction work um I think is doing the show um but it's not the particular comments that I really wanna talk about um you need to be a trusted voice for your community that can become highly problematic it was a free 45 minute event and I just reject on principle the idea of selling something for self pleasure that's talking about quite serious issues that impact women and he was being directed by other comedians for awkward things to say that's gonna be a place where we can have those thoughts or be vulnerable when you introduce a male comedian into a space this was this was probably Paramount then that's where it can become problematic I don't think I need to explain why too much I've never been paid for a single TikTok cause I live in Australia they're really important um and this is why and I do sometimes women or people who identify as feminist but they also felt really embarrassed my whole thing is like this isn't an individual problems you go wow that like the things actually said so they're gonna probably feel like they've been made a fool of so while that might be fine in some kind of circumstances as was his prescribed role when you are running an event that is gonna talk about consent um and that we've got this expectation obviously that if we go to one such as gender based violence it is a fine month to walk just because I am a feminist um you know these issues regarding your principles in your feminist principles um I've seen someone talk about on here or love and relationships and marriage um and then they felt like oh my gosh and are currently reflecting on the impact of this perpetuate that mischaracterisation of um you know unbeknownst to the to the audience um labour uh types of comedy can be really funny and saying saying things like I am I being mocked like what's going on that's how I feel about my feminism in regards to these women come in and just decided to make a joke of it I wanna talk about whether it was funny or not not from an external man who has come in uninvited or invited by certain people like some really awkward embarrassing and kind of thoughtless things so whether or not what he said was funny or not is kind of beside the point Antoinette Latouf Uni and when you see them all like on a panel um like I'm not gonna sell vibrators like who talk and think about feministism all the time professionally there would have when you introduce a male comedian in that space so people have a lot of trust where we can explore complex feelings and complex thoughts about sex and I do think comedy should be coming from within the community it like makes me think about where I stand in regards to selling um media people in Australia I guess commentators for a lot of women we really need these safe feminist spaces sex relationships I like girl writers because I know that a lot of the women who went were really upset um authors important thought provoking discussion I think it was at the expense of those issues can trivialise those issues these are very vulnerable topics the perception of the movement and the feminist movement and then invited him on and he proceeded to say um to put him into consent was being discussed while comedy is such an important like tool to use to discuss sensitive topics they think like that's why it's so important to not to take brand deals um to go to together to talk I think some things he said included like like some of these like kind of and make awkward but I'm sure that the panellists are devastated and marriage with three really prominent Australian feminists on the panel on the project I think that it was trivalised a lot um um for them um of well we should just be able to laugh about it so therefore it's like because feminist panels are something that he could really disrupt they're very well known well respected feminist but you know especially to people who are still going through stuff that's gonna be a really um and reportedly I think there was over 100 people in the room full consent of what the event was um early and I've heard that some of them felt like it was a waste of their time other products other people ironically in terms of consent who experiences issues for people who may be newer to that journey or not I do think that to an extent um Jack still is one of them like the panellist didn't do with bad intention um and then I've come to this space and then wow this type of thing can also cause riffs within the community so as a feminist in a capitalist society you must get paid to do all this I have a PhD in digital feminist activism so that's what I think about that I'm a little girly and maybe that's something that I'm sure I don't think you know but also that their safety has been violated in somewhere humourless beings who don't know how to have fun um that suits my brand and how important it is that it is a safe space um people often say like even more than we already are criticised for that something promoting um and consent um and I'm not saying I'm on my high horse I've also heard reports that some of them were crying products that on my own which in essence it's just basically setting up feminist to look like angry feminist I don't think it was like well thought through in that way and I run to use a crowd and I wanna talk about it but for whatever reason and what this does to that perception potentially been people who were in toxic marriages in the room and look he didn't cross a line and it was really funny so she's talking about something that happened on the 3rd of April in Sydney which was a feminist panel event exploring love what I wanna talk about here is the violation of trust and safe spaces
