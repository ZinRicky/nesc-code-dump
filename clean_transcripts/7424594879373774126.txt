I am a homeschool mom and my daughter hates reading it kills me a little bit inside but I'm always looking for hands on reading activities to make learning more fun for her so I got this popcorn game which is a fun way to practice reading skills this game practices two different skills CBCC and CCBC skills there's two different levels one where you just find the vowel in the middle and another one where you have to find the blend and the consonant let me show you an example both of these cards are west in this one we just have to find the middle vowel and in this one we have to find the beginning consonant and the end blend it comes with a marker so they can write right on these cards west and they can pop it just like that I really like this because it is one game that you can use with multiple ages or grades and you can practice different skills like what is the missing vowel sound what is the initial constant what is the ending blend things like that there's a lot of different ways that you can use it and you can keep using it for multiple grades so it is something you can use year after year
