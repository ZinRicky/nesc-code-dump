I am not trying to throw any shade at all I just feel like this needs to be talked about cause I don't see it being talked about anywhere the people that are taking these hormones and doing these things to transition to other genders whether it's a man or a woman when you're taking drugs to shut down the natural production of your hormones that your specific gender your physiologic design is meant to produce because men and women have to totally different biological and physiologic designs and hormonal structures and when you forcibly shut that down and then take synthetic hormones instead you're enacting war on your body like full blown enacting war on your body and you can see it you see it in how rapidly these people age and like it the same goes for women that are doing all cause like people that are transitioning and a lot of women are getting the same procedures done ah injections um hormone replacement to be birth control too because birth control also shuts down the natural production of your hormones and replaces it when with synthetic ones that are actually proven to cause cancer autoimmunity all kinds of very detrimental things to your health and physiologic design but like when you get all these things injected you get all these procedures done you get implants that are foreign objects in your body again like even that aside from the hormone like replacing your endocrine systems natural um part in the ecosystem that is your body because you are an entire ecosystem every single component has a very important role to play in the balance and flow of your entire system when that falls out of balance or you actually remove an entire piece like your endocrine system is a very important aspect to your body's function and so when you shut that down and then replace it with chemicals synthetic chemicals um you're causing a lot of health issues and I don't see that aspect being talked about like all the moral and philosophical ideology and opposing views and whatever put that aside and let's just talk about the health component and how destructive it is to your body and how unnatural it is and how hard it is on your body and then what that subsequently does not just like the dysphoria or like whatever mental illness is associated with that shift but just the health aspect like we already know that birth control and hormone replacement causes depression and increase like 80% up like increase in an uptick of being prescribed antidepressants and adolescents like there's so much research and data that already shows how destructive replacing these hormones are in the body and then you add in the mental illness component of like feeling like you're in the wrong body like never do we ever affirm that in someone who has like body dysmorphia with you know they think they're fat but they're actually like terribly skinny and like a really unhealthy depleted state of malnutrition the same goes here like it totally goes here too and it's I'm just gonna say like it's impossible for someone that's doing this to their body to be healthy and to be in a healthy state of mind because of how unnatural and against nature it goes whether you think it's right or wrong or whether you think that it's normal or okay to be born in the wrong body a we're not talking about the health repercussions nor are we asking why no one's asking why this happens people therapist everyone's just going Whoo and then conversy on the other two people were just going like it's unnatural it's against god I'm on the side with god but I'm also on the side of like we need to give them help gender affirming care is not help it's not help it's actually like both sides are completely missing a really important component in my opinion which is why are you this way and what can we do to support you in the root cause of why I totally believe that societal conditioning is is a giant role to play like we shouldn't be telling people that like little boys and people that are dressing up as girls like we shouldn't just jump to be like oh my gosh you must be a girl no like it's okay to like want to dress up in other clothes or whatever parental um guidance you think there was or lack thereof like whatever you wanna call it like saying that like just affirming that you were born in the wrong body is not help that is not care that is not health care that is actually that should be like illegal if I'm being completely honest with you because I know so many people that were like abused as children smexually verbally physically there are so many times where you don't wanna be in your body as children as a woman there are so many times where our circumstances make us not wanna be us right that's why people end their lives that's why people run away that's why people dress or dye their armpit hair or cuddle their hair off or um harden their shell there's so many symptoms and so many areas where it's so blatantly clear that people are just hurting it doesn't mean that we need to run away from this body that is just a symptom that dissociation I grew up in so much trauma smexual trauma like as a child abandonment betrayal death um not feeling safe there are so many times where I felt like I didn't wanna be me and like it wasn't safe to be me and I've seen so many children and women that are the product and men too little boys as well that are products of trauma and not feeling safe and I feel like it's a cry to feel safe to finally feel belonging to finally feel in control so I just wanna go why not it's wrong you're the devil like that's not help and that's not the answer I understand that we're in a war of good versus evil light versus dark god versus the devil like I'm not questioning that that is so evident in so many components of our of our lives right now in the media in the way the governments ran in social media in the news like there's so many areas where it's so clear that it's good versus evil but the division is how we're controlled it's there's so much great area there's so much nuance and it's so unfair and such an injustice to just be like you're just evil you have to ask why why is this happening that's just because conditioning does to predators child predators trauma societal conditioning and then we have to go how do we fix this how do we support the people that feel like they're in the wrong body don't just affirm them don't just applaud them don't just hand them drugs and surgery on a silver platter that's not care no and neither is telling them that they are like against the Bible and against god neither of those offer a real solution to see them and to validate them and to meet them where they're at and offer them the support that they actually need
