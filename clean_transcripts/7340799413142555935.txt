going to explain the Comstock Act why Republicans want to revive it and how it could diminish abortion access in the United States so this is Anthony Comstock he was known for being a village nuisance and a chronic casterbatur in the late 1800s Comstock became obsessed with being the morality police he was against anything and everything that he viewed as being immoral because he thought these immoralities were poisoning society so he was against gambling prostitution birth control abortion anything seggsually explicit even nude art no I'm digressing here a little bit but like the people even in the 1800s were just dragging Anthony Comstock so like we got these unreal comics of him so here he is um being offended by mannequins and here he's chasing a neked cat see how the other cat has clothes on and here the top right is my favorite they're like joking about how he probably bathes with his clothes on eventually this weirdo goes to Congress and explains that all of these immoralities are poisoning American society and that he has an idea to stop it that we should start monitoring materials that are going through the US Postal Service The Comstock Act was born which banned certain materials obscene materials passing through the US Postal Service that are intended for the prevention of conceptions like birth control or procuring of abortion somehow gets Congress to agree to make him a special agent of the Postal Service with police level powers including the right to a weapon so he starts going around personally inspecting the mail he personally seized and destroyed 15 tons of books 4 million pictures and claimed that books are feeders for brothels one of his victims was idecratic who ended up unaliving herself before being sent to federal prison and and her on a living note specifically condemned Comstock do you think it's bad for somebody to blame you and their on a living note oh no of his 4,000 arrests 14 other people said that he specifically drove them to doing that naturally 150 years later Republicans would like to revive this man's work thing is that the Comstock Act is still a law it was never explicitly repealed it's just over the last 150 years it kind of just went into oblivion and became obsolete as it should until now Republicans wanna bring back the enforcement of the construct act because they're saying we already have a law in the books that prohibits mailing of abortion pills beauty of this for them is that they don't need to get the votes and Congress to pass a law this crazy it's already on the books they would need as a Republican president who would lead an administration namely the department of justice that would be amenable and open to enforcing this act already making these arguments so in the mifipristone case coming for the Supreme Court this term anti choice activists are already making arguments that mailing mifipristone in the mail violates the Comstock Act upheld in court it would not only outlaw medication abortion which is the most common form of abortion so hoping to use it to stop surgical abortions by pointing to language in the act saying that it bans any article or thing designed adapted or intended for producing abortion so they're trying to say that you also can't mail any medical equipment that would be used to procure an abortion far from a slam dunk as you're probably anticipating there are so many legal hurdles with trying to enforce a law like this for now I'm gonna pause if you want me to talk about those legal hurdles let me know in the comments and let me know what you think
