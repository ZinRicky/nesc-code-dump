Good morning. So we are here at the dairy. We're giving a tour to a Brazilian group that also has a dairy, and they're selling into 80 milk which will be selling. What are you doing? You know, when we were in Brazil is really when Dan and I both started becoming more and more passionate about agriculture. Because it wasn't a lot of, um, like milk. For instance, when I'd go to the grocery store, all they would have was, um, shelf stable milk, and it gave me a stomachache every time I drink it. And so in Brazil, I, who's always trying to find these little farms which were prevalent, are prevalent there. There's still a lot of rural areas, and so I was finding these little farms to get raw milk from and fresh milk. And so we started hanging out with these farmers and people that were living off the land or supporting their communities. That's really when we fell in love with agriculture and we were like, okay, when we go back to the United States, this is what we wanna do. You know, we wanna, um, get into farming, Wanna support our family. We don't just wanna do like a hobby farm, we want it to be like our livelihood. And so, um. Yeah, that's really where it all blossomed was when we were living in Brazil. We were in San Paulo, and, um. Yeah. So it's so cool seeing this family here. They've been Farming for a lot of years, but now are marketing an a to a to raw milk and fresh milk to super mercados at grocery stores and also direct consumer. So it's very, very cool.
