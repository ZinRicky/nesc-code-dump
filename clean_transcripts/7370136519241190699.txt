I have like a violent amount of makeup like drugstore to like very fancy and out of all of them the best one for my skin tone and like the most beautiful and natural and all the ones I go to the most is this Colourpop Blush stix in cool it like I have used almost all this is all that's left and this is genuinely my favorite blush to this day because it's so like natural and gives me like the perfect flush for my face and for the longest like this is for example another version like this is great and all but it's like really pinky so you have to blend it out much more and I'm very heavy handed right so this one is like the perfect like tone for my skin because I don't have to do much of the blending and I used to buy like the most pigmented like Pussy Pop pink blush and then like spend like so long trying to blend into my skin where I was like oh I can just have something like this is like more subtle and more appropriate to my skin tone and then like I don't do all that work blending I just tap it out a little bit on the edges and that's it and that's I'm done anyways I know again other people have probably realized this but as someone who's always gone very heavy handed with makeup because I don't want it to look like I'm not wearing any of that makes sense like I want people I won't wanna wear makeup approval to know that I'm wearing makeup but now I'm like learning how to do a little bit more subtle makeup um and I don't know I just I love this blush and it's my favorite
