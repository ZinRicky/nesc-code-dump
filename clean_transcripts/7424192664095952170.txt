Hurricane is over and we are very very fortunate not to have any damage I know that's not the case for everybody but I feel like I can finally breathe it has been the most chaotic like two and a half three weeks ever the day before Hurricane Helene we closed on a house moved in before the Hurricane hit and then had a bunch of tornado damage to clean up we have been trying to move into this house get settled and then the anticipation of Hurricane Milton it has just been so chaotic I feel just mentally and physically exhausted from the like emotional roller coaster the last couple of weeks have been I finally feel like I can take a deep breath and we can focus on getting settled into our new home making it feel like a home getting back into a normal home school routine with the kids I just like finally just feel like okay we are safe we are good okay
