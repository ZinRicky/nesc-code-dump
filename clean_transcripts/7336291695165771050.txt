if she doesn't dress up for you yet she's going out to girls night and getting all dolled up she's not your girl! Mmm mm I'm sorry, so sorry but she's not now I'm not saying that she has to dress up for you every minute of the day when you're at home she can be comfortable in her own clothes but if you take her out on a date and she's not getting dressed up for you she's not your girl meanwhile when you see her getting ready for girls night she's getting all dolled up dressed to the nines putting in effort.. she's not your girl argue with me all you want but give me an explanation that makes this make sense to you
