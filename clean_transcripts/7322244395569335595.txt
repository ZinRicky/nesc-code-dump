Texas continues to take issue with its basic requirement to save women's lives here's the latest Texas is suing the department of health and Human Services over what you might think is non controversial guidance from the department of health and Human Services but no so Texas is suing over this guidance if a physician believes that a pregnant patient comes to the er with an emergent medical condition and an abortion would stabilize that patient's condition then the physician must provide the treatment oh no no no no says Texas here's what's going on there's a federal law from the 90s called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act: EMTALA EMTALA basically tells hospitals that look if a patient comes to your hospital into the er you need to screen them and if they have an emergency condition you either need to transfer them to an appropriate hospital or you need to stabilize them so after Dobbs came out the department of health and Human Services had a sneaking suspicion that red states were going to start denying pregnant women life saving care so they sent out this guidance basically being like hey red states like we see your total abortion bans but we're just trying to remind you that you have certain federal obligations to save women's lives so if a woman comes in and an abortion would stabilize her when she has an emergency medical condition you have federal obligations to do that so Texas sue is over that because it doesn't want to have to comply with that guidance it wants its state abortion law to control because its state abortion law is much narrower than that guidance and I'm gonna save you the legal nitty gritty unless you want it then tell me in the comments but basically the 5th Circuit agreed with Texas meaning that if a pregnant Texan woman shows up to the emergency room and an abortion is what she needs to stabilize her care that is not allowed in Texas and we're seeing the same litigation out of Idaho and I just want to make clear how dehumanizing and humiliating it is to have states debating if and when they have to save our lives like I feel so gross disgusted and humiliated reading these pleadings so at the bare minimum I just wanna make sure that women understand and know that this is litigation that is going on states in the United States are actively arguing about when they have to save your life or provide stabilizing care for you because they don't want to
