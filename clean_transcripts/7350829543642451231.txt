why is it women shouldnâ€™t be on their phone when they're walking outside they shouldn't be wearing headphones they should be aware of their surroundings and not men shouldn't be randomly punching women in the face women are constantly being told what to do to not get assault but men are never told to not assault women I literally feel like I'm going crazy
