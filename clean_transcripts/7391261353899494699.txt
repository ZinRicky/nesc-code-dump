Joke. Donald Trump today was speaking at his rally. Oh, my goodness. Guys, whether you like Trump or not, surviving an assassination attempt has been incredible for voter approval and turnout. Whoever shot ex president Trump almost absolutely guaranteed him to win president. This is absolutely crazy. Do you guys see him with his hand up, or do y'all think that Trump's team staged that? That was staged. That would be an all time low for Trump. Either way, this is some super juicy stuff, and I can't wait to find out more about who actually tried to shoot Trump.
