Ron  Desantis is threatening to prosecute TV station that air pro choice ads that he doesn't like as if the First Amendment doesn't apply to him first and most importantly let's watch the ad that he's trying to ban my first thought was am I gonna be able to see my daughter again the doctors knew if I did not in my pregnancy I would lose my baby I would lose my life and my daughter would lose her mom Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine amendment for is gonna protect women like me we have to vote yes the ad is encouraging voters to vote for amendment for which would untried abortion rights into the state constitution and Republicans know that abortion access is overwhelmingly popular even among Republicans so they don't like ballot initiatives because they generally need to keep the issue of abortion out of voters hands every time abortion has been on the ballot even in red states voters have come out and said that they want abortion access so Desantis is doing everything possible to try to get in the way he's spending taxpayer dollars to fight the amendment he is sending out election police to interrogate and intimidate residents and apparently now he is threatening to prosecute TV stations that run ads to promote the amendment the letter um claims that the ad spreads false dangerous information because Florida's six week abortion ban actually does not pose any health risks to women I oh my god forcing women to carry unwanted pregnancies is incredibly dangerous maternal mortality in abortion ban states is skyrocketing see what the letter is saying is no actually see we have these exceptions for to save the life of the woman or if she's at serious risk of substantial irreversible physical impairment as I and physicians all over the country have explained is you can't legislate on healthcare you can't say well you can treat someone if they're on you know if it's to save their life it's like what what point is that do we need to wait until women go into organ failure do we need to wait until they go into septic shock do we have to try organ transplants first like this doesn't make any sense and in Florida if a doctor gets it wrong they face five years in prison physicians are understandably reluctant to provide care in the state of Florida because they are risking prosecution and having the state disagree with their medical judgment the state basically saying well she wasn't sick enough yet to qualify for the exception every time I explain this I'm like this is so insane what really makes me wanna just send myself to the moon is in this letter they're like you know because of your ad women may believe that treatments are available in Florida so they might travel out of state and not get care here oh my god oh my god you guys are threatening physicians with five years in prison if they provide an abortion that you don't like you are the reason that Florida residents are in danger their life is in danger and that they are being sent out of state for care before I digress even further um in the United States we have something called the First Amendment the government doesn't get to pick and choose and regulate speech it doesn't like Rhonda Santos doesn't get to threaten to prosecute TV stations for running ads he doesn't like Republican efforts to keep the issue of abortion out of voters hands and doing things like this threatening to prosecute um speech that it doesn't like all of this is emblematic of how attacks on abortion are attacks on democracy if you wanna learn more about this I cannot recommend Jessica Valentie enough and her new book is out on abortion I highly recommend getting it there's so much more I could say about this um but for now let me know what questions that you have I'm the feminist lawyer follow me if you enjoy being miserable
