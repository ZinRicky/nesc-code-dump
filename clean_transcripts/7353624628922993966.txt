It’s absolutely insane how much women expect from a man that they're only dating. Men in the early dating stages do not owe you anything. The only thing a man owes you is, connection, compatibility, little bit of attention, but you're not his woman yet. Why does he have to pay your bills, Buy you gifts, take you out on expensive dates? To prove that he can earn your love? That's absolutely wild how some women act in the early dating stages. Men don't owe you anything, they have other responsibilities, bills as well. However, if you're his woman then he can spoil you. But you should never expect it. I'm just saying, women have a convoluted idea of how dating should be, and what dating actually is about. It’s absolutely wild. It’s absolutely insane. Men don't owe you anything while dating.
