okay yes and no to this sentiment first of all I don't need a new husband mine's great but in this conversation where we're talking about dads figuring out their own way to parent and their own way to take care of their babies this is not really a realistic or helpful because the reason dads are not prepared to be caretakers is because societally there's zero expectation for them to develop those although it may not seem like it all the time this is actually changing in a positive direction in 1982 which is around the generation that like millennials were born 43% of dads had said that they never changed a diaper by the year 2000 that was just 3% we are just getting to a place now in our social history where raising children and participating in the home and domestic labour is not simply seen as women's work millennial deaths are actually doing better than any other generation of fathers before we add a place of fifty fifty equity within the home and within child raising absolutely not and we absolutely should be doing better and expecting more but the way to solve that problem isn't to tell women to pick better men to continually raise the bar of expectations for each generation and to have these conversations about equity within domestic labour before you have a kid in my thought process this is a two prompt problem an individual problem between a couple and then also a systemic and sociological problem and the more we talk about it the better
