it's another day of homeschool at the Hollies and today we're starting with speech therapy today we tried something new and went live during our math lessons and we had a blast I really love sharing our homeschool days and I am so passionate about helping and teaching other parents how to homeschool too you get little snippets of that here and there and these voice overs but going live was just a whole another level it was like giving you a front seat into our classroom basically you got to see a real unedited school which was so cool is to encourage other parents who are either new to homeschooling or on the fence about homeschooling that you can do it too it also give you all a chance to ask questions about what I'm teaching why I'm teaching different teaching methods different curriculums all of the things and those are the things I absolutely love having conversations about I will say it was a bit of a distraction and kind of hard to do both at the same time so I'm not gonna do it all the time but I would love to do this more often if it's something that you would find beneficial so if there's like a specific topic or subject that you need help teaching and kind of want me to teach you how I would teach it let me know in the comments maybe we'll start like a TikTok live trading where I teach you how to teach your own kids so we can all be homeschooling together the requirements would be a cozy blanket coffee and lots of snack now that sounds like a teacher trading I could get into
