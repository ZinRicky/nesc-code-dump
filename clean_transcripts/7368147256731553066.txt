I'm with you in that. Like, my house is a fucking mess, my kitchen is a mess. Everything's a mess. But I'm happy my kids are here and nobody fucking ignored me today. I didn't have some piece of shit man make me feel like shit and somehow be thankful for that. So I hope you're all enjoying your mother's day as much as I am.
