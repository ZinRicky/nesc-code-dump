I ended the day looking like this but I'm only telling you that cause Jump scare for the entirety of this video I look like absolute shit but we're heading out later which means that my in laws are currently on their way cause bless them they kindly volunteered to babysit and I wanna get the pins out later so I'm marinating in fake tan and it's a different brand to my usual and I'll tell you the developer is intense and I have such a small window to sort this house out but I work well under pressure and nothing will motivate me quite like the threat of people coming over my husband always teases me cleaning like this whenever we need to go out he doesn't see the point because I don't get to enjoy it and it'll probably be messy by the time we get back but I think that “setting the vibes” needs to be formally recognised as an official love language because I know exactly what needs to be done to this house to make it feel good and if it feels good when my in laws walk in then they'll feel good and if they feel good here while they're babysitting then maybe they wanna come back and do it again do you see where I'm going with this and also even though we've been married coming up to 13 years horrific I know I still want them to think that their boy is in good hands okay although I do believe that they've discovered my TikTok now so they probably already know that I'm actually insane but my final and probably most compelling argument to cleaning before you go out is you do not wanna wake up dusty, in a filthy house anyway you know how we’re heavily focused on our pool renovation at the moment every minute of sunshine we get we're spending outside but the weather where I live is about as Moody as I am we honestly get four seasons in one day but today we're just getting one season and it's the rainy season so it's actually the perfect time to clean my house I kinda due an inside day cause I've been working my fkn ass off out there and just kind of ignoring everything else that goes on inside including the washing which is been really piling up and took me a significant amount of time but we're just gonna chuck Netflix on and power through it And this… I'm kind of embarrassed about this but I tell you what my beautiful little girl is definitely the messiest of all of us I can just about guarantee you when I wake up tomorrow those toys will be everywhere again But it's okay cause I tried my best and for at least one moment it was clean I do need to renovate that room but not right now right now I need to renovate myself and head to coldplay
