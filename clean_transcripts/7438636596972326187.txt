If you want to know what your man is thinking when you're talking to him in scenarios where you want his opinion or you want him to express himself Do this! Start talking less Im not saying this to be mean whatsoever we as women just love to chat we love to talk it makes us feel good but if you take a 30 second pause after you ask him a question or deliver a statement to him he'll tell you what he's REALLY thinking men are more logical so they put more thought before speaking But if you interrupt him.. You'll never truly hear what he has to say
