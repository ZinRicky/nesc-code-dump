here's the thing when thin people come to talk to fat people about the issues with obesity they are almost never ever saying something that we don't already know right because growing up fat means that you are so cognizant of your health and of the issues of obesity and you know what's good I probably have more understanding of nutrition than the average thin person because of the amount of nutritionists and dietitians and like personal trainers that I have personally seen I stopped dieting in the last six years and this is the first time in my life that I have been a like consistent maintain weight up until six years ago I was consistently my entire life gaining weight because I would always gain weight gain weight gain weight lose weight gain weight lose weight gain weight lose weight but that that that weight that I I kind of you know after I lost and I gained I I was always more than what I had started off with right (typical of yo yo dieting) so I had a really really bad relationship with food and it wasn't until I started to decided I wasn't gonna die anymore and I was gonna eat intuitively and heal my own feelings and relationship with food that is like what the best that I could have done for *my* health right and people love to come on to my page and act as if I do not know what health issues are associated with being fat there are fat people that work out that eat healthy that you know go to the gym that that that skip eight hours of sleep at night like you know what I mean there are fat people that I believe are healthy I'm very mentally ill don't really go to the gym have a really bad sleep schedule have like violent ADHD that impacts every single aspect of my life like my most of my health my the worst part of my health isn't even my fatness it is my ADHD right because it impacts every aspect of my life so when you come into a fat person's comments like I mean my doctor like we are locked in we I have regular checkups I have regular blood work done I like I take my medication I me and my doctor we talk about my shit you know what I mean ah you don't need to know the details of my personal health and when you come onto a fat person's page and say did you know that's actually bad to be obese babe like we are very well aware of our health right and then people who may not have the privilege to go to doctors and have medications in the way that I do what how are you benefiting them you are not giving fat people any new information when youâ€™re like obesity is actually bad babes like oh my god especially when you're like comments are unwarranted and unwanted if that person is like hi I'm struggling with obesity and I would like you know to deal with my health issues I you know do you have any information can you help me whatever you do that you guys have that conversation but if you're randomly giving *unsolicited unwanted advice* to fat people that's where the fatphobia comes in because why is this random person's body any of your business it's not it's not hope that help moral of the story is don't give people unsolicited health advice that's that's that's the issue
