okay it's the end of the night and I wanna go on a little bit of a motherhood tirade this is the state of my living room right now it's not terrible but like this is the part of parenthood or motherhood that keeps you from moments of connection like before I had kids I thought all of parenting was tied up in the connections and the moments that you spent like connecting and enjoying your child and it is but what nobody tells you or at least what you can't like conceptualize until you're in it is how much of your time and energy is going to be taken away from moments like that in order to upkeep and to take care of said children's needs like the labour involved in cleaning up their toys cleaning their clothes making their meals cleaning up after said snacks and meals like takes so much effort and energy out of you shuttling to inform activities that sometimes you have to remind yourself to consciously let that stuff go in order to have the energy to create the connection moments
