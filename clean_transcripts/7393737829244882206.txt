things I don't care about as a mom number one how many snacks my kids have throughout the day we only have healthy foods in our house so they can snack as much as they number two bedtime they are homeschooled they can sleep in as long as they want so I don't really care when they go to bed as long as they're getting up number three if they make a mess or break something if you break something whatever we can replace if you make a mess just clean it up No. 4 if their room is messy that is their space if they wanna live like a pig go for it No. 5 their clothes I don't care if they don't match if they are wearing rainbows and butterflies or graphic tees I just don't care as long as they are happy and confident in it that's what matters No. 6 wearing shoes outside they can go barefoot for all I care
