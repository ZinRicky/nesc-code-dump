camera shots of Taylor Swift I swear this is where to go to here a lot of people have accused Taylor Swift of overreacting I wanna talk about why having a completely neutral reaction as a woman to a sexist joke by a man is deemed as an overreaction by the patriarchy I'm Doctor Zoe I have a PhD in digital feminist activism so let's talk about it so for example the term resting bitch face is pretty much reserved for women I never really hear anyone refer to men as having a resting bitch and that's because women are expected to appease and smile and passively accept and I guess give permission for men to be assholes we are expected to kind of smile and get over it and make it all pleasant and we spend a lot of our time and energy um because we're socialised to um doing this so when we begin to reject that we actually have to work there sometimes we have to work it you know saying actually no I don't wanna do that and actually no I don't have to smile for you and Taylor Swift didn't even react aggressively or pull any sort of bad face she just basically refused to smile at the joke that wasn't actually really a joke at all and no wonder I think she has a very valid reason for not finding it funny because American football has basically cheered her up and spat her up like they've used her milked her taken advantage of her and the market that she brought in like the awareness that I've been able to achieve through association with her has been you have absolutely capitalised on that until the team started doing badly and then she was used as a scapegoat to blame basically so she's probably very recently experienced what it feels like and what Posh Spice experienced um years ago when Beckham with this this exact same thing happened they blamed posh like oh she's you know she's being a distraction to the game that's why Beckham isn't doing well she's probably very recently experienced this feeling of feeling like she's been used and milk to throw it's worth and then she's there to also blame when when the team doesn't do that well which I mean I know Taylor Swift is very powerful but is she that powerful that she can control the sports performance of a whole team of men so then for them to make this joke I understand that it's a lazy joke it's lazy writing and it's just not very funny and I don't really think she has to have any sort of reaction to it and she didn't she just sipped her drink and refused to smile but when you refuse to smile as a woman you're labelled as the aggressor because being neutral as a woman is not being neutral it seems being aggressive cause we are expected and socialised to appease and make room for and be okay with men and you know there was an implicit question in his joke which is are you gonna let me get away with this and she was kinda like no not really I'm not like we hold more power like you know Barbie Taylor Swift all of these amazing you know like Ali Long these are powerful women and those jokes are the jokes of men who are struggling who are in crisis because they don't know how to make jokes anymore because they don't know how to survive in a world where their jokes are not funny anymore like they were never funny but they're definitely not funny anymore
