I had a weird experience this weekend that makes me believe I kind of understand empty nest syndrome a little bit more I have three little kids and I homeschool my two older ones so my house is never devoid of children I have zero time in my house when the kids are not also at home but my parents took all three kids for the weekend this weekend and at first my husband and I were so psyched that we're gonna get the house alone because you know we have these beautiful spaces but we never get to like cook and relax and like actually sit on our couch so that was our plan for the weekend that's all we planned on doing is just hanging out and relaxing tell me why it was so difficult to actually relax in a big empty house it's almost like all of the stresses and anxieties and like compulsions that you have within your house while you're taking care of kids still there you just have this like phantom anxiety that the kids aren't there so although all day every day we look at our beautiful space and they're like oh I wish we could sit and enjoy these when we actually got the opportunity it was jarring and I think that's why empty nest feels so weird cause your body's used to the chaos
