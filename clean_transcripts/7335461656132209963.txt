what does a man need to do to get a woman to notice them? okay women are very simple very simple creatures we want a man very simple we want a man who acts like a man you know a manly man who takes care of things and is a leader no, we don't need you to unalive a bear with your bare hands but we need to feel so feminine around you, because you're so masculine that we can just shut off our brains when we're around you we trust that you got it, we trust your character, your intelligence, we trust that when we close our eyes we can follow you blindly and we're gonna be happy about where we end up that's what it's about we go out with you and we can shut off our brain you know order the whole menu for us the food for us do the planning the scheduling take us to a date plan the day tell us where we're going and we're ready we're set honestly it gosh it is so lost on us in today's day like when we as women go out by ourselves, when we're alone we're very paranoid and aware of our surroundings but when we have a man there to protect us we can be calm and walk in peace because we know that we're being protected and guarded like yes toxic masculinity isn't good but we need masculine men in the world it's really important In a time of new age feminism and like the idea that women and men need to be the same and they need to compete with each other that's not true it's all lies so you may ask, “so you don't wanna be equal?” that's not what I'm saying, we're equal in value but we're different in role and the way we operate Women want a masculine man so she can be in her feminine energy
