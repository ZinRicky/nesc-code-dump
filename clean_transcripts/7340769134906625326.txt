okay but you're wrong because being a trad wife means returning to traditional goals traditional times traditional life traditional gender roles the man is the bread winner he goes out into the world that big big scary world and he fights all those big mean monsters for you and you get to be a traditional woman you get to stay home in your pretty dresses because you must look nice for the male gaze you must please the man and you spend your day making sure you look pretty because as a traditional woman you must keep your hair long and you must look beautiful at all time and you cook dinner and it is piping hot on the table for your husband when he comes home and because he is your husband he was put in that position by god our father the Almighty up above and he he your husband is the only one with the trained ear to hear what the Lord is telling him and so your husband has authority over you you are letting down your god your father your husband your family the world as we know it when you are not upholding your position as a traditional woman and wife in these types of marriages and if you pay attention the only people really promoting this lifestyle are other women in it in their 20s and looking pretty and still think it's nice and fun to make bread look I made it it's hot it's so yummy oh my gosh it's those women or it's men misery loves company and it only serves men that's why those are the only people you hear promoting this lifestyle go ahead and dismiss me go ahead please how do I look do I seem bitter go ahead and know what the comments are gonna be but the people that fucking get it get it and the trad wife life is bullshit
