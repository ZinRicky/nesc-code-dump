Why does accountability not come easy for women? one thing I've noticed is that it's a constant process of emotional justification for our actions without admitting our mistakes for example when she's a young girl she learns that if she cries shows her emotions to her father when she's in trouble then she learns that her dad might go easier on her he might let up he might talk softer to her We learned when we were younger that not admitting our mistakes and showing our emotional response will get us out of a lot of things in adulthood she gets pulled over by a traffic cop and instead of admitting her guilt she starts crying so the cop might give her off with a warning or be nicer to her or just let her off scotch free we learn when we're younger and older that we show our emotions then we don't have to be accountable for things see what I'm saying it kind of just trains this type of behavior in us women not even realizing it it's not necessarily out of manipulation we just struggle to take accountability I'm not saying that this is just a woman thing I think at some level we can all find it hard to stay accountable not only for ourselves but for others if you struggle with accountability and you don't know how to change do this identify your problem areas of where you struggle to stay accountable after own your mistakes in order to improve and learn think about the areas that you struggle to find accountability and put that under a magnifying glass that's the only way you're gonna learn how to improve You have to, number one be honest with yourself set pride aside and own your mistakes forgive yourself and grow from it lastly you should always reflect make accountability a habit and don't let your emotions take away your logic and reason
