I know it's gonna be a lazy home school day when my day starts with a little guy in my day I need a full 8 hours of sleep to function and I definitely did not get that last night so I am dragging today it's often rainy and overcast which is not helping so we enjoyed a really slow morning with Christmas music decorating and some outside time and then we were all ready to jump into our day we do block schedule so today was math history in bio I often get asked if I double up on math and reading lessons I only do it twice a week and the answer is no because I do not care about getting through my curricule the goal is mastery so I do a lot of activity that cover the same task so I'll teach a new concept and model it for them and then we'll do a gamer activity and practice it together and then they'll practice it by themselves and then we also review things we've already covered so I usually spend about an hour to an hour and a half teaching that subject each day this helped my kids master concept so much faster but I couldn't go that deep if I did reading and math in the same day so that is why I split them up and do block scheduling
