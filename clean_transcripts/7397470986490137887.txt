post therapy look nose is red but the eyes aren't too puffy today I didn't have a full on crying sesh like I normally do but if you wanna know anything about me I am a crier I cry happy sad funny heartwarming it does not matter I'm going to cry but today I held it together it was my first day with my new therapist so there wasn't like a whole lot of like in depth chats but still I'm a crier I'm gonna cry but hopefully the eyes won't puff today those are always so bad
