misogyny is not “hating women” that's a completely useless definition that's actually counterproductive and all it does is help sustain the patriarchy let me explain describing misogyny as hating women eliminates our ability to actually diagnose anything that we see in front of us as being misogynistic for a few different reasons let's use Donald Trump as an example so if you say Donald Trump is a misogynist first of all you can't get inside his head how are you going to prove that internally he hates women second there are women that he loves he loves manga women he probably loves his wife he loves women who he's attracted to he loves women who help him further his goals and he just generally loves women who behave accordingly to gendered and societal role misogyny and all this is Kate Mannes’ Down Girl which I highly recommend is more productively understood as a political phenomenon it should be understood as a system that operates within a patriarchal social order to police and enforce women's subordination and to uphold male dominance it's a system that is policing people into behaving within their gendered norms and expectations and it's policing people to continue to uphold the patriarchy misogynist can love their mothers not to mention their sisters daughters wives girlfriends secretaries they need not hate women universally or even very generally they tend to hate women who are outspoken action was all about misogyny and that doesn't mean that people went into the voting booth thinking I hate women what it was is that this election was policing people's gender norms it was ensuring that um trans individuals can't get healthcare ensuring that women across the United States perform reproductive duties about um making sure that a woman didn't have authority over men so much more um I have so much to say about this topic because this is such an incredible book I am the feminist lawyer follow me if you enjoy being miserable
