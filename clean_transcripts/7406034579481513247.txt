I'm not mad at all the gray that's coming in in my hair, and I'm. I'm kind of like, happy to see some of the. The signs of aging and maturing on my face. It's been a burden to be a young, hot mom all this time, and so now I'm. I'm happy to move into the silver fox, older mom, 40 year old woman phase of life. It's exciting. It's the new adventure. Lots of new shit on the horizon. Don't count yourself out, ladies.
