About 2 months ago I put some little baby seedings in the ground for our Winter Garden and I think it's time for an update because I'm lowkey shocked at how well she's doing I started by pulling some weeds and chucking them on the grass cause they looked a lot like my husband's problem for later and we've been enjoying so much of this rocket but it's officially bolted which must be why they call it rocket right I found some helpful friends popped them back and restocked my baby rocket which I think my American friends call arugula and you might not know it just by looking at it but we've actually been eating from this garden every single day moment of appreciation for the cutest broccoli I've ever seen in my life I've never grown broccoli before but I must admit it's the most exciting thing I think I've ever done ever I harvested rocket silverbeet Cavolo nero kale cos lettuce spinach and bok choy before it was time to head inside and process and I don't know if it's just me but even when I wear gloves my hands still get dirty as a mum of young children who loves to clean and get outside I wash my hands so many times a day and I have found some soaps in the past have irritated my skin especially under my rings But Protex is full of Omega 3 flaxseed oils which provides a natural antibacterial protection while maintaining the moisture within my skin And Iâ€™ve found Protex to be gentle enough for everyday use by the way my green thumbed mother in law taught me this trick years ago if you wanna get rid of a stem turn the leaf upside down and hack sides on an angle it'll leave you with nothing but leaves but some stems I like so take it or leave it that's our garden haul for today
