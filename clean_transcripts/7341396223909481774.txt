They can't be happy, find a job that makes them happy or live a life that makes them happy they can't find value in their life why is that? it's because we're chasing things instead of taking a step back and realizing that real growth comes from within you create your own happiness and environment, and everything else will fall into place Take care of your body, your mind, hit the gym, drink your water, go to therapy, start journaling, do that inner work and stop chasing birds. okay build your treehouse, build your birdhouse, and make it beautiful. that’s truly when your goals or desires find you, remember you don't chase you attract!
