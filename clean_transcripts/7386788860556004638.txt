When I went to visit my mother the last time, she politely told me I had a mustache. And I was like, no, the fuck I don't. And I don't. What it is, is I have fucking sun damage that creates, like, little brown spots, like, right there and there. So now I take being in the sun serious. And look at this cute hat I got. It's almost like a visor. And then you put it on, and that way you can, like, have your hair up. You. Also, your head doesn't get all fucking hot and shit and, like, cute. So that hopefully my mustache doesn't get any worse. Gotta love a mom. Gotta love her.
