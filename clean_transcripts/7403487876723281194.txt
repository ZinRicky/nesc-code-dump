You know what sounds really good after a long day? Some wings. I don't wash my chicken because you genuinely don't have to, but you can do as you please. This is what I make when I want a quick dinner. I started by seasoning my wings, adding some baking powder to my seasoning, and then popping them on a wire rack. While those were baking for about an hour, I started on my chimichurri. They were making chimichurri wings. I've been thinking about this combination for about a week now, so finally I'm coming around to recipe testing it. I chopped up some parsley, cilantro, shallot, some capers, grated some garlic, some chili, and then seasoned my chimichurri. Made sure to give it a really good mix. I also added some Korean red pepper flakes to it. After about 30 minutes, I flip my wings and pop them back in the oven. I always like making some type of slaw to go alongside my wings. Something creamy but not too heavy. We shredded some cabbage carrots. I added my tangy dressing on top and set that aside and got started mixing my wings with the chimichurri. Once all my wings were coated, I topped it with a light layer of Parmesan cheese and these were absolutely divine.
