My husband grew up eating Pop Tarts and Toaster Strudels, and this morning he was craving them, so I decided to make him a hybrid out of both a Pop Tart and a Toaster Strudel. Started by adding my dry ingredients into a food processor and slowly dropping in some cold butter. I let that go until it resembled the size of pebbles. For my dry ingredients, I whisked up an egg, added a splash of milk, made sure that was all combined before I added that to my dry mixture. It was a lot easier plopping it on a work surface and kneading it for a little bit, so that's what I did before I wrapped it up in cling film and put it in the fridge while I got started on my filling. I was debating between raspberries and strawberries, but strawberries won, so I added them to a pot with some honey and lemon. When they were cooked down, I blended them up, added some cornstarch, and let that thicken before putting that in the fridge to cool. In the meantime, I rolled out my dough and cut it into six pieces. I wanted them a little bit smaller than usual, so I did that before spreading some of the strawberry filling on top. Then I placed a second piece of dough on top of that before using a fork to seal the edges and poke some holes in the top. I let them bake for about 30 minutes, and then pulled them out and let them cool while I started on my glaze. He loves lemon, so I decided to go with a lemon glaze for these. I didn't want it really thick, so I decided to make it a little bit thinner, and they were done. Lucky walked in at the perfect time to try these, and he absolutely loved them. I'd never had a Pop Tart or Toaster Strudel before, but these were really good.
