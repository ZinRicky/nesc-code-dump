so this is a story all about how my lounge got flipped turned upside down and if you'd like to take a minute just sit right there and I'll tell you about how I painted it six different colours and unfortunately I'm not even talking about these test pots I'm talking about how I genuinely tried and committed to six different colours before finding the right combination the first thing you should know is I'm an idiot clearly and the second thing you should know is this took 6 months I started with this half of the room and I clearly painted it mustard bold fkn choice. I don't hate it at this point tho and then I turned around and saw this in the other half of the room and I thought hell my mental health is already unstable why not push it and try and get this room done I don't know 5 days before Christmas and spoiler alert we did not make the Christmas deadline I don't know why I'm surprised and as a mother of three I don't even know why I tried I did manage to seal the walls so that they didn't look so I don't know hideous the day before 25 people came to my house for Christmas hands up if you’re also always the host and then this I'm ashamed to say this is New Year's Eve looking back at this footage I can't help but laugh like what the fk was I actually up to I should say as well this is never seen before footage and there's a reason it's never been seen before and that is because I was immediately filled with deep regret over my decision making so this room actually this whole house is very Mid century and as you can see there's a panel that divides like the top third of the room from the rest of the room and I really like it when people paint their ceilings an interesting colour and I thought maybe I could be one of those interesting people with interesting ceilings and I've gotta say mustard is about as interesting as it gets and obviously white wouldn't have looked any good with it side note nothing would have look up with it so I ended up complimenting that bold mustard with this soft kind of limoncello colour by the way this is no shade at the paint or the colours they are absolutely lovely it just wasn't lovely placement on my behalf looking back on it now it was definitely a vibe like it does look cool it looks like a cool retro TV set but living in it it was maybe a bit much for this room anyway because I have since realised that this room is actually a fkn nightmare to work with I'm not sure if you've noticed but there are a lot of different things going on in this room there's two different spaces, a lot of little surfaces, built in shelves like there's just a lot going on but when it comes to paint I subscribe to the philosophy that you should absolutely push the boat out and try something new and if you don't like it you can just cut your losses and change it it's pretty cheap pretty accessible and it's a fun DIY I'm telling myself that to make myself feel better but seriously I'm just so fkn sick of white she says as she has just finished painting the walls white and to be totally honest painting the mustard out of this room did make me a bit sad but it just wasn't working in the other area and considering these two spaces are connected it's got to be cohesive so it's gotta go and so I sampled and my little mind boggled turns out I'm quite indecisive generally though I'm not that indecisive I swear it's just the curse of this room anyway so I sampled another colour this is Potter's Park by Dulux and I absolutely love it but did I love it here in this particular space no I did not I would like to put it anywhere else just not here maybe in my daughter's bedroom or maybe even the creepy laundry so once I had successfully made a bad room worse by painting random swatches all over it so that it closely resembled the inside of my brain ha ha messy I made the executive decision to boss my husband into painting everything white and it stayed like this for quite a while actually I needed a beat okay this room had traumatised me and I lost all my confidence in colour but then one day recently I thought I'd try again I thought I'd try this one and I thought this one might be the one her name is Ponsonby she is from Dulux and she is stunning as stunning as she is I mean they're all stunning but I just I wasn't feeling it so now we're on to colour No. 6 and I’ll have to let you know how we go in the next part
