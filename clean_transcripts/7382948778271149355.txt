here is a quick tour of my 1950s chamber stove I always get so many questions about the stove it's very unique and beautiful so let's get started the first thing you might notice is this grill broiler section on the top of the stove you can cook anything on the top here that you cook on a hot plate or kind of Blackstone style grill this part actually lifts up to light the gas this does not have a pilot light so I manually light it here with a match inside part can also be used as a boiler or grill depending on where you're from and it's fully adjustable now this is the oven it looks smaller than it actually is it's pretty deep and it goes all the way back to the back of the stove the bottom of the oven has a solid piece of cast iron so the temperature is well regulated throughout the whole oven no hot or cold spots right now we have the stove separate propane and here's the switch I have to turn the gas on and off but I wanna completely shut the gas off there is a pilot light on the top and this is for the daisy burners only there are three separate pilot lights and this is the only one I like right now this is a bevel to go on the top to protect the pilot flame this is my favourite spot this is a little timer it got a bell on there still and it still works this part cleaned up really well and I love using it now this is the wall in the back this is a firmer wall so it keeps kitchen nice and warm in there with or without the gas this is their famous um selling point that you can cook without the gas there's so many things you can cook in this firm and well they have a whole cookbook and I'm excited to try all the different things you can make in this firm and well
