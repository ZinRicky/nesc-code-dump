we just moved into a new house and by new house I mean brand new construction it just finished last month we are the first people to live here and along with that this whole section of our neighborhood is brand new so like all 10 to 15 houses just closed within the last month and the amount of solicitors we are getting is insane we have lived here a week now and I'm getting like four to five door knockers a day and we were in our house so the kids cannot answer the door for anyone or anything so now they think it's funny to like knock on things and pretend it's a swister so I have to get up and go check the door the next person who does that yeah I'm I'm starting to lose my mind
