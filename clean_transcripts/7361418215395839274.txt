my thing is once I love you like I will love you forever and I feel like this is like for every situation but specifically specifically for friendships and like platonic relationship I just like there is a part of me that will always care about the people that used to be friends with me and like I don't know if it's because I have ADHD so I like literally forget things that happen in my life and I you know luckily I think I'm able to remember the positive and so what I do remember is positive um but I do I think because of that forget when people have done me dirty but honestly like I'm happy about it because I would much rather I think move for the world with love than without and I genuinely don't care what the situation is like if at some point me and you are friends even if we don't talk even if we got into falling out I what I don't care if I had love for you at one point in my life and you need me or like you need someone or like you know something is going on and or even if you feel like wanna reach out and like talk and like talk it out and like you know rekindle and apologize whatever like I am always willing to hear someone out especially if I have had love for them in the past I just like because it when I think back to that time period in my life when we were friends even if we're not friends now like I will think of you and I will think of you fond despite you know whatever might have happened and I think a lot of relationships that have been in the past have run their course you know but like there were still always be you know pieces of my heart with these people that were like there for monumental like you know milestones in my life I don't know
