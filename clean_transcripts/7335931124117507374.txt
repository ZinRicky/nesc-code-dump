I asked my husband what he wanted for Valentine's Day dinner, and he said steak and chimichurri. So I put him on steak duty while I started all the other stuff. One of his favorite sauces is chimichurri. So I got started on chopping up some cilantro really finely, then moved on to my parsley. I like to take a good amount of the stems off, and then I diced up some garlic, chilli, and shallot. I added that to the bowl with my cilantro and parsley. Squeeze of lemon juice, some olive oil, and red wine vinegar. Also a lot of salt. Gave that really good mix and let that sit while he started washing the potatoes. Lucky can get really specific in his shapes and cuts, so I decided that he was just in charge of cutting up all of our fries to get them really uniform. She did a really good job at well, I made us an elderberry lime mocktail. Then he questioned me putting the potatoes in ice water, but did it anyways. And I prepped some garlic for the broccolini. We put all of our food prep out, and then he dried off the potato. Or double frying our fries today. So I gave them their first fry, set them aside on a wire rack. Lucky got started on our steaks. He is always in charge of steaks, and he also reverse seasons them. But while those were resting, I sauteed some broccolini and some Mushrooms in a ponzu sauce. And then once our steak was done resting, I put our fries back in the oil to get them nice and golden. I also did this in batches just to not overcrowd my pot. And then once they were done, I sprinkled them with some sea salt, and then it was time to plate. Put our fries down. Broccolini steak and then topped it with chimichurri. And lucky said this was a 10 out of 10, so he had to have another plate after this.
