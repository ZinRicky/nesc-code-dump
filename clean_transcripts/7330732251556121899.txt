The other day, I tried putting on some denim that I would always wear, and it wouldn't even come past my thighs. That's how I know that I've hit 30 weeks pregnancy, and I don't fit any of my clothes anymore. We used to get dressed together a lot, so I'm back to show you one of my pregnancy outfits. I checked on this white blouse and some white stretchy pants. Obviously, I've been obsessed with wearing my Birkenstocks. And then I layered my jewelry and popped on this brown leather Bottega bag.
