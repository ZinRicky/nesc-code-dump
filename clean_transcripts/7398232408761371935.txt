If you got these super cute lights from the TikTok shop, when you get them, remember, you need to press them down in the middle to kinda help them splay out and be cute. Otherwise you just have like, a little ball, a cluster of lights, and instead of the kinda cute whimsical look that they're meant to give. So just a little tip, you just give them a little help, press them, and then that's when they become kind of floppy in the wind.
