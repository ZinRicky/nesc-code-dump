one of the really cool things about my job is that it takes me all different kinds of places and this weekend I had the opportunity to go to Galaxy Con in Columbus Ohio I have never been to a comic con and this one was really really cool I flew in on Friday and then this was on Sunday so it was a very short trip there was a very wide variety of actors and actresses from these in TV shows that I grew up watching and really enjoyed and I was so honoured that I got to meet some really really cool people including Hayden Christianson Zachary Levi and the Cullen Guys from Twilight I mean slay there were so many things to see and do with this convention in just a few short days and there was a ton of walking that happened in the process I was also so happy I was one could say psyched to meet the cast of psych and that was really cool experience once I checked out of my hotel I found this market not far from the hotel and I got some work done had a yummy matcha along with some delicious tacos before I headed to the airport and I'm ready for my next adventure
