the thing that former fats that I will never understand is how you can exist in a fat body move to the world in a fat body knowing and experiencing how difficult it is to be fat and how cruel the world is to fat people and instead of when you lose weight and you are no longer feeling the effects of fatphobia personally me for me if I had ever lost weight and like people start treating me better and like I no longer was experiencing fatphobia it would infuriate me on behalf of my old self you know what I mean like I cannot understand how you in contrast are in that position and rather than being upset at the way the world treated you you are now contributing to the cruelty that you experienced in this past version of your body like that that to me is like something I just like will never understand and it's like I don't know if it means that like you hated the past version of yourself or if you still hate yourself or if just like you are not a good person and you have always been waiting for this opportunity to exercise your like dominance and like casual cruelty on others I don't really know what it means but it will never not disappoint me to see former fat people being some of the most fatphobic I that is genuinely very disappointing to me
