I wanna further the deep dive into the crunchy to crazy pipeline and why the conspiracy theory is so dangerous and why it depends on the mental illness of mothers and how that ties into my fears about RFK's appointment I'm coming from this not from a place of judgement I'm coming from a place of experience because there is a point in time where I was heavily influenced by crunchy tendencies I started a homeopathic remedy kit I took colloidal silver I had Mullen garlic I started preparing homemade everything down to like elderberry gummies and I got an air popper because microwave popcorn was full of cancerous carcinogens tried to import as many things as I could because I had read way too much about the industrialized farming and the industrialized food industry here in the United States they've always said that there is a good point there is a spectrum to being concerned and proactive about what you put in your body and obviously this sort of specialized diet conversation does not go for people who have food sensitivities or food intolerances or require a specialized diet what I'm talking about is that there are those of us who get so hooked in the anxiety of it that it goes to an unhealthy place and how I recognize that I was an unhealthy place could potentially help somebody if you're on that path because I developed what is called orthorexia and that is when you are so concerned about unsafe or eating only clean foods that it becomes an obsession it becomes a level of mental illness and it becomes really really unhealthy so how to tell if you're in a unhealthy eating place as far as your crunchy tendencies one you cannot socialize or go over to other people's houses to eat cause you're worried about there not being any safe foods for you to eat if you don't think your kid can go to a kid's birthday because they may or may not have pizza and a cupcake at that birthday and that that would cause too much harm for your child if you believe any medical intervention is going to negatively impact the health and safety of your child those are top three because people like RFK and people who are in this country community people selling um dotera people selling the essential oil things are benefiting and capitalizing on your fear and that fear can go from a normal place that keeps you safe and healthy and making informed choices to an unsafe place that completely impacts not only how you view the medical community our food system our government and then ultimately other groups of people cause it depends on fear it depends on mental illness and it depends on the ability to manipulate your feelings about your own personal safety and mothers especially mothers experiencing postpartum anxiety and postpartum OCD like I was are especially especially susceptible to this because you're watching this crunchy motherhood community rally around RFK like he is the answer to all of the corruption within our food system and I'm very well versed in our food system I'm a trained chef and I have hyper fixated on like Michael Poland's books and the industrialized food system so I know there are negatives that need to be addressed he is also talking negatively about people who are on ADHD medications or um antidepressants and and mood disorder medication don't think that this is also not gonna spill over to birth control because the crunchy motherhood community also speaks really negatively about birth control and yes there are side effects to birth control there is nothing you participate in there is not one choice that you make where you are not weighing the pros and cons the pros of birth control for women as a whole outweigh the cons at the moment does that mean we should be putting more research into it putting more money into it making it a safer product researching women's health at a more um aggressive level yes but taking away a safety net for women because you think it's too toxic is not the answer you cannot take away a safety net without something else in place I feel the same way about our food system we have an industrialized food system that is made to feed a large majority of people if you have money and you have access you can get better ingredients you can grow your own food you can support local farms people who do not have the ability time money or access to local small farms require the industrialized food system kids who are getting free school lunches communities that are food deserts uh they require cheap food so if we are not going to first make sure that all of our communities have access to healthily grown sustainably grown and cheap inexpensive Whole Foods you can't take away or highly regulated system that is currently keeping people from starving because guess what people would rather be fed low quality food than not be fed at all I feel exactly the same about vaccines there are people who want to have the option to put their kids in public school without vaccinations there's people who are saying oh it's my personal responsibility it is not there are negatives to taking vaccines there are positive to taking vaccines the positives as a community system far outweigh the potential negligible percentage of people who have an adverse reaction making you scared of something that is in your best benefit to do and use and depend on is manipulation things like antibiotics things like bleach and household cleaners things like fast food even solved a problem that existed can these things be better yes but be very careful that you are not being manipulated by your fear and your anxieties and your mental illness into a place where you are now going to distrust everything every modern convenience and modern invention that has been created that has solved the the death or the suffering of millions of people over time because that's not in your best interest and they're depending on it
