it's spring cleaning season here and I would be embarrassed about the state of this barbeque except it's not actually my department and if it was my department it probably wouldn't look like this but I'm pretty sure there’s a saying about how one person loves to clean and the other doesn’t and then they get married and annoy each other for the rest of their lives and I'm not saying that hits a bit too close to home but there is another term for it and it's called irreconcilable differences so anyway in spring and summer my man loves to grill just about anything and I love the break from standing in the kitchen and I love a barbeque so I just leave him to it assuming - I don't know - that he cleans it as he goes? and he's trying to convince me that it's not actually dirty but because it's gas he's just got it really well seasoned and I'm starting to think that maybe that's gas lighting so I started by clearing out all that ash and fat and whatever the fk else was down there and giving it a good scrub with some Jif soapy hot water and a scrub daddy that hardly made a dent so I tried some bar keepers friend And my trusty steam cleaner that definitely helped but I'm this far into it now so we may as well go in with some heavy duty oven cleaner and I don't know if it's obvious but I know even less than my husband when it comes to cleaning a barbeque and I can just about read the comments now mansplaining exactly how to do it and if you're precious about barbeques you might wanna look away about now cause while I waited for the oven cleaner to develop I decided waterboarding her would be the next appropriate action step and I will say it worked a treat once I went over the outside and I did the grills and the other thing I don't know what it's called then I switched back to my steamer and I started to steam away all of that oven cleaner and finally I felt like we were getting somewhere Its definitely not perfect but it'll do I guess which is exactly how I would describe my husband right about now and would you believe I did all of that for a break from cooking
