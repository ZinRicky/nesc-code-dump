I don't care that she's thin this film to me is fat representation so this is Penelope, long story short family curse makes her have a pig's nose and ears and this is like very rich blue blood family and so obviously like they're ashamed of her so her parents basically pretend she died and have kept her like locked up for you know 25 years because they don't want her to be seen by the public and they've been trying since she was 18 to get rid of the curse because she to be accepted by one of her own so they're trying to get her to get married to another like Blue Blood Man and then when that happens in the nose will disappear and she'll be “pretty” obviously but it's like I I wish I could explain it but you just need to watch it it's fantastical it's romantic it's coming of age and honestly it's like I think kind of ahead of this time there's like such a good self love message behind this and like the cast is just stacked Christina Richie Wednesday Addams right Reese Witherspoon her friend Catherine O'hara is her mom and her love interest is James McCoy Peter Dinklage is also in it he's like this reporter it's it's just it's such a good film and like James McCoy as love interest like cause also like you watch him grow it just and her like learning to love herself and like find love despite this like big thing that she thought would make people you know afraid of her and not wanna be around her you know she thought she like was unlovable and like she literally wasn't living as a person because of this thing I don't know there's very little positive fat representation so when I watch this film I I see myself represented in her obviously I know that she's not fat but I don't know there's just some films and some characters that aren't fat but feel fat coded to me and I'm gonna relate but like watch this clip so she goes off on her own and like goes missing so her parents call the police police are like okay like can we have a picture of her so we can know who we're looking and didn't even have a picture of her and this is the clip the detailed description brown hair uh huh brown hair uh huh brown eyes uh huh a uniquely pleasant personality think pig so she's a fat girl not exactly you cannot tell me that that's not fat coated anyways I love her and this film genuinely I cannot recommend it enough please go watch it and enjoy
