hello good morning uh today I wanna talk about the pipeline now usually on my page I'm talking about some sort of nefarious far right ideology pipeline but today I wanna talk about a very innocent and very fun pipeline and that is the fairy tale to dark fantasy pipeline now this is just a theory y'all don't have to come after me but I feel like there's absolutely a correlation between kids who love like fairy tales and then transferred to Disney kids who then grew up to be musical theatre geeks and fell into either the Lord of the Rings Harry Potter or Star Wars fandom or all three from there you get offshoot to people who um like enjoy anime or people who go to the Renaissance Fair and cosplaying and all these people end up at the same end of the pipeline which is dark fantasy fairy Smut and I think sometimes people get stuck on the pipeline they end up at a certain fandom they dive all the way in they make it their entire personality but it all leads to some sort of dark fantasy porn it's the most adult part of the pipeline honestly the sort of desire to engage in fantasy goes from childlike wonder to adult desire and it's just a healthy happy place to be y'all are my favorite people if they aren't already making a visual format for Fairy Smut meaning like dark fantasy porn they should be because that's the next step on the pipeline and I would totally watch that
