does anybody remember the season of the bachelor where there was that girl who talked about her platinum vagine and I'm pretty sure it was the fucking one with Nick Viall I'm pretty fucking sure which is funny cause I can't I think he's fucking disgusting he just got married to that super young girl like you're so fucking gross but anyway the girl that had the platinum vagine there was another girl on that episode that really didn't like her and was like in one of her little private interviews she was like she just really doesn't have any emotional intelligence I swear to god that's the first time the term emotional intelligence was really shot out into like mainstream and like pop culture where like people who were uneducated were talking about emotional intelligence I swear to fuck it started with that season of the bachelor if it didn't that's when it woke up for me and I was like emotional intelligence what I just I guess I didn't realize there's you know you can I I wouldn't have used those words but that's what it means like you can be really smart at math but really not good at reading or really really smart with emotions and you can pick up on them but really really dumb in other ways so you know intelligence is it's on many things okay the same thing applies to love romantic love is just one kind of love like that's why I feel like in Spanish when you can say tequiero te amo you know there's different ways to express the love that you're feeling and I feel like women need to realise that romantic love is not the only love that's fulfilling to your heart you can have you know the love between a parent and a child like when you're that I think that sometimes that's what sours the parenting relationship is parents get so focused on their maybe unhealthy marriage that they're trying to hold together for the kids that then they miss out on having those really fulfilling relationships they could have had with their children or people are so focused on their romantic relationship they miss out on opportunities opportunities to have really fulfilling friendship love and in the same way that there's so many different types of intelligence you know not everyone's a rocket scientist not everybody is a cardiac surgeon you know everybody has different skills and abilities that go that is also the same for love there's different types of love and romantic love is not like at the APEX of love and if that's the love that you don't have in your life then you're a fucking loser and you suck there are so many types of love including self love that are so much more important that women need to realise and see the value of and put their time into as well and funny enough sometimes it leads to romantic love wow
