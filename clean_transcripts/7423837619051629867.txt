Wanna know what will ruin your relationship more than cheating? Getting lazy and I'm not talking about letting yourself go or gaining the happy relationship weight it's the not planning the dates not looking cute for each other not putting effort time and energy like you once did in the beginning of the relationship All of those little things that you first did for each other to keep the relationship to keep this spark going once you stop doing that that is the start of the end of your relationship I guarantee it and most of the time those relationships always end up poorly because they're looking for outside sources to feel validated heard and seen they end up cheating or they end up talking to people that they know that they shouldn't so this is a reminder do not get lazy in your relationship Plan the date, look cute for them cook for them be that person that you once were when you first started dating
