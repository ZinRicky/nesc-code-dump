we are at our new house taking some measurements and y'all are a little confused about why we don't have any furniture to fill our home and short story is four years ago we moved into an RV and sold everything that we own because it wasn't worth storing we didn't have anything that we spent like good money on just like wasn't quality so we got rid of everything and lived in the RV for four years and then obviously everything that was in the RV was meant for the RV so we didn't have anything and we have been renting since April we rented a house that was fully furnished because we didn't wanna have to deal with all of it and if you watch my video about when we purchased this house we did not plan for this this was not in our 2024 bingo card we were not expecting to buy this house or have to furnish a house so fast we were thinking we were buying furniture for our dream home but that was not the case so here we are now we've got to furnish this whole house
