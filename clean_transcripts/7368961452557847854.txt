Hi guys Victoria lit here Modern day TRAD wife it's recently come to my attention that not everybody knows the difference between a sundress and a milk maid dress I pulled out some of my dresses to show you, explain what a sundress is vs milkmaid I love wearing dresses so I have a couple here here is a sundress it does show a little bit more here so it's not as modest this is a sundress yellow, flowy, strappy great sundress here is another sundress flowy at the bottom, straps this is a sundress another option this is a sundress the flowy at the bottom has an open back, sundress I would say this is a sundress But more of like a milk made inspired dress though this is also another milk made dress see it kind of like cinches at the waist loose and flowy kind of more of a modest top love that and this is another milk maid dress longer version more modest love that it has a little slit on the side here but this is a milk maid dress those are the differences
