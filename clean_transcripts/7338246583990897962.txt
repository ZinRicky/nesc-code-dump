how many phone numbers in your phone do you actually have memorized like the people closest to you I don't even know my mother's phone number off the top of my head I would be lost without my phone right cause you don't have to dial it you just look up in your contacts and hit the number and it calls whoever you wanna call right that is exactly why being in a relationship where your partner does everything for you is really a bad thing you're gonna lose that ability to make decisions you're gonna forget how to think for yourself so if this relationship ever does fail you're the one that's gonna suck you're the one that's gonna pay for it entirely and why would anyone set you up in that position why would somebody want you to be in that position maybe it's because they don't really love you cause control is not love maybe they just want to have power over you so that they are the more powerful one in the relationship and then you're stuck think about that
