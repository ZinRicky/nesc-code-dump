when I was married and I was trying to figure out if I should get a divorce or stay married or what should I do we have four kids one of them is disabled I live thousands of miles away from family like what the fuck am I gonna do and I was like really searching for answers to try to like make it work and make it stay somebody recommended this book why does he do that inside the minds angry and controlling men and I thought it was gonna give me the answers to like figure out how I could work with him how can I just like be the right partner maybe you know I just need to learn how to work around him you know he's the man of the family and I'm his wife and his supporter and it's my job to like kinda work around him and then I read this book and realized there's no fucking excuse for that kind of behaviour and this book is fucking wild because the dude who wrote it Lendy Bancroft he spent years and years and years like 20 years or some shit working with domestic violence criminals helping rehabilitate them and they all knew exactly what the fuck they're doing you know how like when you talk to your friends and like other women you hear their stories and you're like wow were we dating the same guy like was they know what they're doing they know what the fuck they're doing they absolutely know what the fuck they're doing and one thing I always used to say was oh I know he doesn't mean it maliciously like I've he just he just had a long day he's just really tired you know stress is really getting to him the fact that doesn't give you a right or a reason to take that anger and frustration out on the people closest to you if anything they are your comfort zone they are the people that you can fall into at the end of the day as a release from all that stress they're not the person you take it out on that's not the way a relationship should work so if you've never read this book I highly recommend it if you don't can't buy the book you can Google this there are PDF versions available online everywhere this author just truly was fucking horrified at what he heard these criminals saying and he wanted to make sure that people never fucking suffer like that again so you should read it
