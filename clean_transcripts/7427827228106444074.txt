I'm using this comment to piggyback and continue this conversation because this is also why men leave women when women get sick and I always think about Yolanda Hadid if you don't know Yolanda Hadid was married to David Foster she was a real housewife of Beverly Hills and then she got or had been dealing with but it got really bad chronic Lyme disease and she started to be really really ill for a long time pretty much bedridden on a lot of medication she had a nurse and like really shortly after that David Foster and Yolanda Hadid got divorced and this isn't conjecture this was actually said on the show but that like she forgave him because she's like he didn't sign up to have a sick wife he didn't sign up to be a caretaker yes you fucking did when you got married and he couldn't handle it so he left because there's a certain type of man who is only in a long term relationship with a woman to be taken care of and catered to and when someone within the family whether it's the wife or a new child needs more of that love care and attention at that certain time they can't take a backseat they don't understand that a partnership a relationship a family is the push and pull of energy and effort and affection because if that man isn't gonna take care of his own child and jealous of the care and needs of their own child just imagine if you got sick
