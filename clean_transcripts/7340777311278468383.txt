so I'm here in San Antonio because I'm going to be participating in a debate about abortion and we got some of the questions ahead of time and one of them is about how does your belief about the status of a fetus or embryo like when life begins basically how does that inform your personal belief on abortion and it's really critical to pay attention to the fact that often when we're having these debates about abortion that's what the debate ends up centering on like when is a fetus a person when does life begin what ends up happening is that you come out of the gates with this patriarchal framing like you're already centering the discussion on the potential rights in the potential life of the fetus rather than the debate question being about women's right to bodily autonomy women's right to not be forced to do labor that might kill them at the hands of their government why don't we have a debate about forcing children to endure reproductive labor and childbirth the goal is to get us all so wrapped up in this question that we're never gonna reach a consensus on like when does life begin to detract from the very real torture and trauma that we inflict on women and their existing children through abortion bans and this all necessitates a really important discussion on the privilege to just philosophically wonder about these things like there are women who have died because they were denied an abortion there are thousands upon thousands of women who have died from lack of access to abortion from having unsafe abortion there are women fleeing states right now to get emergent medical care and I guarantee you that none of these women the ones who have literally been on their deathbed were sitting there wondering I wonder the status of my embryo or fetus they were hoping that they would live another day to see their families and so I refuse to participate in these types of questions that are only meant to detract from the very real harm that we are inflicting through policy on real life women independent women right now in the United States
