list of things that I think men should never do starting off with number one-cooking if you have a woman then I think that she should do it okay personally, I leave that up to me unless it's the grill unless it's like a steak you got the meat I'll do everything else number two-doing their laundry I know some of y'all are gonna come for me but I just don't think men should have to cause they're not good at it they don't know how to fold they leave it in the dryer for too long and then when they take it out it's all wrinkled just just leave it up to us woman okay No. three-decorating so sorry those neon signs gotta go the flags with your sports thing you know I think that us women we have an eye for it leave it to us No.4 buying groceries or preparing or planning what we're gonna eat for the week cause if you leave it to a man they're probably gonna be cooking you beef just beef. no sides no greens just beef No. 5 dusting I don't think any man should ever be seen dusting with those little things I just it doesn't sit right in my brain okay that no explanation needed there No. six mopping I don't think I've ever seen a guy mop and for good reason I think men should be allowed to vacuum but leave the mopping up to me No. 7 putting laundry away not sure why but it's just not built into their brains to know that the dish towels and the bathroom towels are two very separate things leave that up to the woman okay I understand that all men should know how to do all these things but I donâ€™t think they should have to do them
