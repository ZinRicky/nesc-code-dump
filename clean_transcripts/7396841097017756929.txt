I want my nails to look like Elsa herself fkn threw up all over them doesn't seem like much to ask by the way if you think I sound sick that's because I am anyway so I'm taking off on holiday tomorrow good time to get sick I know I'm so excited because if I don't take a break I might have a breakdown and we're going to the snow so naturally that means I need some ethereal Fairycore 3D maximalist snow bunny nails and for context I'm a Gel X beginner and I'm currently doing my dominant hand with my non-dominant hand so it's hard and for further context last week we had a rainy afternoon stuck inside and me and my daughter watched the two frozen movies back to back So Elsa is very much my inspiration I want my left hand to be giving Frozen 1 and my right hand to be giving Frozen 2 if you know you know so I did my base coat and two coats of a sheer pink from Bloss Gel went in with my blooming gel before doing a white and silver ombre effect sealing that with the top coat and then going in with my chrome sealed it again now we're gonna attempt to do some snowflakes which was really hard using my left hand I've been seeing these 3D gel flowers all over Nail TikTok and I really wanted to try them I rolled my Solid Builder gel out into balls shaped them into petals pressed them to give it a bit of texture Chromed them, painted some details and glued on my caviar beads definitely not perfect and I probably could refine the shape a little better but for my first go I'm not mad at it my index finger I just went simple with one snowflake and a few droplets of snow before getting started on my melted snowman and oh my goodness I love him didn't think that I would and my two snowmen definitely look quite different from each other but I like them and the kids like them and that's the main thing so this is the finished set it's definitely not giving clean girl it's definitely not giving minimalist manicure it's giving loud snow holiday nails and I'm here for it but what do you think? do you think Elsa would wear these?
