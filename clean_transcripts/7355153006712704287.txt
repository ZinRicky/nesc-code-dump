you never and I mean never leave someone who is drunk alone without a way to get home I was leaving the library at 5:00am and this girl I hear her come into the library just as my Uber is pulling up and she's asking security guard if he had a charger because her phone was dead and I'm like what's going on and as I'm walking out like the security guard is being useless and so I give her my portable charger and this girl is p!ssed drnk like it is 5:00am she's like in boots she has she's not aware of what's going on and like I'm trying to help her like figure out where she needs to go for her phone is dead it's charging on my thing eventually I just like I have to type her address into my phone and call her Uber myself because I don't know who she was with or what her friends were doing but I cannot comprehend how you go out with someone who I'm assuming you call your friend and then leave them in New York City alone p!ss drnk especially right now when people are getting punched in the face what is wrong with you I don't care what the situation there is no reason why you should be letting your friend who is like so drnk that they can't function walk home alone especially if they're girl and especially if their phone is dead anyone that does it to you is not your friend and y'all need to be better friends Iâ€™m like so mad right now
