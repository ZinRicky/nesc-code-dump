but it's so Swiftian to do that you can just take stop for a minute gender Equality and you're grazing cause we're in N Korea and she runs this entire place it was giving like and it's all a fast and it's a machine and we just have to grin and bear it everyone knew she was gonna announce an album you just met the love of your life just kind of you made it babe and you have just surpassed like a billion records I've just launched the Taylor Swift Foundation I think your skirts caught on fire we all thought it was an album a beautiful moment and really gotten on the right side of history there and done that someone tell her she's made it and I think someone needs to tell her she's actually so much better than that you got the full love story going on you are flying high that's what I was giving and she could have actually gone ahead of the game like truly like I do think that it's very Swiftian you could see the Grammys trying to grapple with what was going on like something I genuinely think would have just been an and call for a ceasefire it's my lucky number they weren't actually pissed off that would have been just such a stunning moment an absolutely stunning whatever she's passionate about queer youth it's very important taking that moment to announce an album and like that would have been a stunning conversation to start I think that someone tell Blondie that she's successful and she can stop with the treadmill do things in a traditional Loki web everybody in the crowd looks so pissed when Taylor announced her new album you just hit these landmarks and I know probably not she's just launched eras tour on Disney plus but if not that why not you should not be acting like it and guess what just kind of go back to basics and you should be really aware of your I can actually see your place in that like and you know what they say is like power is blind the colleagues in the room like milestones I would be saying babe overseas aid and like they did a very clumsy job of it so this is my 13th Grammy like you should be the one who's like so aware that that is the case the thing you never had before so I'm gonna do something I've never done before announcing an album but also just the right thing to do would have been to take that moment and I think that this is why but like you could see it's like because it's like cause as your wealth multiplies so does your responsibility to humanity I don't know and I think that like when you reach billionaire status that what would have been a genuine surprise cause if you are blowing in to the Grammys she would have truly clowned us now is the time to a bajillion dollars dedicated to XYZ something that I think we could have all cherished and I'm very excited about the secret that I've been holding in for two years and I know what you're thinking that's never gonna happen once you have it you can't see you have it I'm gonna do something I've never done before it's a thing what's going on overseas and in g@z a and Iz and all around the world this is the thing it would have been what the world needed we all know that and I know nothing about PR just take stock to just take it down a notch the picture perfect announce your foundation where you're gonna give away all your money our dictator I think that they were just resigned to their fate like you just become billionaire she needs to be starting to give away her millions and she needs to be like you have Girl Boss too close to the sun and you are the most powerful person in the room absolutely exceptional PR move I don't think people thought it was a new album like save the album announcement for Tokyo you're grazing she's actually so much better than that and like everything's very successful and amazing for you right now Girly Pop Taytay my love you got everything ever wanted alright our leader has announced this thing and we all have to smile and look happy if I was her PR team just think about things a little more carefully was not actually surprising behaviour from the Swift I don't know whatever
