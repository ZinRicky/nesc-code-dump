We have all been lied to Men and women have been lied to It's so easy for us to compare ourselves with other couples online compare ourselves with other women who get “princess treatment” bragging about their men paying for their nails, hair, shopping sprees I am going to be brutally honest with you that is not princess treatment princess treatment is how he can support you and emotionally validate you he's patient with you, he won't let you go to bed upset You feel safe and vulnerable with him and he doesn't raise his voice towards you You can bring up any concerns that you have without him getting upset because he can handle it he can handle anything that you throw at him emotionally he'll handle it with logic and reason empathy and patience he tries to understand you princess treatment is how he talks to you how he touches you I'm not afraid to admit that I like when I get spoiled with gifts makes most women happy and elated but I still don't consider that princess treatment I think we all need to stop letting social media convince us that princess treatment is in lavish gifts or things that you buy because princess treatment true princess treatment cannot be bought
