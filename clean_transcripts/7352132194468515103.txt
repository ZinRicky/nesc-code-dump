something about people who don't love themselves gets like tangled up when they see people that genuinely do love themselves and are comfortable in their body I think because it reminds them of what they don't have it reminds them that they're insecure and others aren't instead of dealing with their own issues they like get mad and they're like you can't like yourself you're lying cause I don't like myself because they obviously think they're better than you they can't imagine why someone who's “not as good as them” could like themselves and they can't like themselves anyways point is if you like yourself there is always gonna be some person just like mad and yapping for no reason especially if you're a fat person oh you know there are several YouTube video hour long YouTube videos at that and people have made because I like myself and they hate themselves I genuinely feel nothing but pity for these people so I wake up every day comfortable in myself happy in my body and confident in the person that I am they will never be able to say the same it makes them furious
