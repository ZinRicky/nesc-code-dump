I finally found sheets that are long enough to cover my mattress and my box springs. These sheets went viral a few months ago, and I'm so happy I finally got my hands on them. Our bed is very tall, and our mattress is really thick, so I chose the extra deep set of sheets, and I love them. Right off the bat, I noticed how soft they were, and it wasn't like a hot, flannelly, soft feeling. It was more of a smooth, luxurious, soft feeling, if that makes sense. And like I said, I love how deep these sheets are. They cover the entire bed. I didn't have to yank or pool to try and get them to fit. And I will say that my husband is very picky about sheets, and he loves them, so they're kind of a big deal around here. Head over to Amazon and grab yourself a set.
