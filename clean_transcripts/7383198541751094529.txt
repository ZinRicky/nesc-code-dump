on any given day you should probably be sending thoughts and prayers to my husband because this man has the patience of an actual saint and if you've been following any of this series you will know that this room has been torturous but let's be honest it's probably been torturing him more than it's been torturing me and today just for shits and giggles I thought we could torture him together with the world's most difficult sheers The sheers normally? not that hard but in this room? extremely fkn problematic because we have a raked ceiling but low window heights and weird measurements and other things that I don't care to understand anyway so we've got the same freedom S fold sheers in the dining room which is the room off this one which has an extremely high ceiling so in that room they're perfect but in this room we pretty much needed to cut them in half and also cut all the tracks but the fabric comes with these little strips so you can just cut them to size iron that on hang them and then youâ€™re away it's super easy apparently I don't actually know cause I was no help at all my job was to be the tester for quality control and I can confirm they passed but this white rug unfortunately did not pass the vibe check I absolutely adore this rug it's thick it's cosy I'm gonna pop it in my daughter's room but for now the dimensions are just all wrong there's a bit of a backstory and maybe I'll tell you one day but the long and the short of it is we needed a bigger rug to fit this space because this side of the room has kind of a weird layout it's pretty long but pretty skinny and I'm not sure if you've noticed but my couch is enormous somebody even commented and said it was too big and you could be right but also all we do here is sit and I could either have a ton of extra floor space or a ton of extra ass space and I chose the ass space, obviously cause there's five of us and we often have guests and we all need somewhere to sit anyway the new rugs centred it all really nicely and I promise you'll get the full reveal in the next part
