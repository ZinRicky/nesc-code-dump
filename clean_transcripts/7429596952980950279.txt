Alana do you feel bad knowing that children will bear the brand of climate change I totally do see why this is so funny but also I have like some very serious and real points to make about this because I had this conversation the other day and it was really annoying and I won the debate and I wanna tell you some of the things I said because inevitably like this is I know that this is conversation that other people will be having not just me I was like drinking having nice girls night with some girls who like late 30s not having kids like decide not to have kids um which is awesome and like they I told them like I wanted to have like a baby and they were really critical and they were saying like why would you bring a baby into this world climate change like the world is burning none of which I disagree with in terms of the world burning but it didn't change my mind and I was like well you know what women like again our reproductive systems are becoming political like our bodies are political playgrounds we know that we are still somehow in 2024 fighting for like abortion rights like rights to choose rights to access basic healthcare has been practiced for a very long time the abortion one is just like such an easy one to point to but there is like so many different ways that our bodies are political playgrounds and our reproductive systems and our reproductive potential is just like constantly common question we can't win with her like a single mum we can't win with her don't have babies can't win with her do have babies can't mother properly just like just like a never ending like set of judgement climate crisis let's point to the women to solve it did you know that having a baby is the worst possible thing you can do for the world in terms of like you can like become a vegan and you can recycle all you want and you can like ride your bike everywhere but if you have a baby undoes all that are men getting that type of judgement you know what it doesn't matter because maybe they are and this what I'll say that women are the ones who are socialized and conditioned from birth to give birth they are told a whole life you will find fulfillment you will be a real woman if you have a baby and re and fulfill your reproductive potential that will be the most amazing thing that you ever achieve in your life it is drilled into us it is drilled into us right and we are told to accept that reality whether or not we want to both things being valid whether or not we want to that is it and like we are criticized if we choose a different path right we are you cannot argue we are conditioned we are told we are told in multiple ways from our families from the media from politics from friends that societies everything we're told this is what you'll do and it'll be great and you'll be a woman it'll be amazing and if you don't do it has to be this whole thing why I'm not doing it then the climate crisis happens and then we're told oh my God if you have a baby you are the most selfish woman for having a baby that men are not told the same message like so yes we might criticize men as well for starting a family now but they are not the ones who will suffer as much at the hands of the criticism just the way that they don't suffer as much um when they are single dads or just dads they get a lot more kudos for a lot less so why are we now turning around climate crisis let's look at women's bodies to solve the climate crisis I think not I don't think we should do that I don't think we should go down that route because at the end of the day it's just another way of controlling women and putting the owners on women to solve a problem that men started and created the climate crisis men created the wars so why should I deny myself and my body the one thing I've always wanted to do whether or not I know that I wanna do it because I've been so socially conditioned into thinking I wanna do it I don't even know but what I do know is that I want it and why should I not to get to have that one thing I want because of all these problems men started cause that sounds to me like victim blaming and that's what I think about that what do you think so it's like in part of the world women can't choose like in parts of America women countries in a lot of countries in a lot of cultures women cannot choose discount for a lot of the struggle and the pain that women who are forced to give birth and forced to have babies also go through like it acts as if we live in that world we don't live in that world like we don't live in a world where this is not still a contentious issue where some women are forced to give birth and for variety reasons assault abortion laws contraceptive access resources to information education we don't live in a world where that's more still an ongoing problem and maybe when we live in that world let's have that conversation we live in a world where birth and babies is very much still something that happens to women not for women and then people wanna turn around and be like well judgemental about why I'm having one men are already judged and forced and coerced into doing it and now we're also being the same into not doing it for different reasons then people say well like you wanna give birth but you're talking about like all the women in the world who like can't choose to give birth and like how becoming a mother and all that social conditioning is like patriarchal but then you wanna go and do it you're missing the whole point okay let listen this is why we have been giving birth before the patriarchy ever existed it is something we have been doing for literally ever obviously men the patriarchy did not invent giving birth they wanna control it cause it's the one thing that we have that we do that they don't get to what they try to control obviously but they we do it they wanna control how we do it they wanna control when we do it they wanna control if we do it the conditions under which we do it but we do it and we've always been doing it the patriarchy does not own women and people with uteruses giving birth and having children they want to but we've been doing it for a long time long time before the agricultural revolution and the concept of virginity was invented the concept of marriage was invented in order to control patriarchal bloodlines we've been doing it for a long time before that we've been doing it since matriarchy we've been doing it for a very long time very very long time I cannot stress this point enough to me choosing to do that is not a patriarchal choice I am not somehow like and like don't think that your choice to be child free is like being a feminist hero either it's not being child free is not inherently feminist just as having a baby is not inherently feminist being able to live in a world free from structures that dictate how our reproductive systems are policed fighting for that world is feminist fighting for a world in which we do have choice is feminist but the having of the baby the not having of the baby all that shit no we have matriarchal bloodlines that go back to forever forever and ever and ever and come along in van patriarchy start wars create climate change through greed dictate the terms on which women have babies so that they're forced to have babies and then we turn around create the conditions in which women turn around and judge each other for having babies that my friends is patriarchy at work stay safe
