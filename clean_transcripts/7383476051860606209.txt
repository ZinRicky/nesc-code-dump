this room has been straight up torturing me for the last six months and I won't lie, I got a bit over it at times but today I'm happy I'm fkn elated actually because I can officially say she's done this is our very mid-century split-level dual lounge which is another way of saying it's two rooms in one with a lot of different surfaces and spaces to think about so I've tried to make it functional first and foremost hence why there's a bar in it I've tried to use colour both to delineate the two spaces but also to tie them together I leaned on white primarily and one half of the room because I wanted the view to speak for itself and I wanted the darker half of the room to feel cosy sophisticated and elevated we've got a mix of old and new some objects are upcycled and some are from each of our parents or grandparents who aren't related by the way and after a really long time of struggling in the space I'm actually quite pleased at how it's come together I'm sure you'll let me know what you think actually I just realised we're not quite done cause one day that fireplace will get replaced but good enough is good enough and that's enough for now
