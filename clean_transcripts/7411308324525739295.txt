One more thing about this sweater is it feels like I'm wearing crochet blanket, because I kind of am, and it feels that way. And then since they're granny squares, it just makes me feel like I got, like, a granny's love wrapped around me all day. I cannot realistically put into words how much I genuinely fucking love this cute little sweater from the TikTok shop and sleep right here. And, like, it's kind of cute, though.
