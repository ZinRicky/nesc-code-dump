so I'm in a very real motherhood moment because my daughter my first born baby um is at summer camp sleepway camp for the first time this year and I have been emotionally freaking out because this girl has been under my care for her whole life she's almost ten um and we homeschool and we don't do sleepovers and that sort of stuff and I just didn't know how she was gonna react she has a lot of sensory issues she's like a very high maintenance girl love that for her um but how is she gonna do situations where like things may not accommodate her but after learning more about the camp and kind of getting a feel for it and her really pushing for this experience um we decided to let her go for a week you know she's watched The Parent Trap she watches Camp Kiki Waka on TV she's like very aware of what camp's supposed to be and her dad and I agreed that this would be a great thing for her to get her out of her shell not only because she has two brothers at home but also because we decided to homeschool last year so this would be great for like socialization and friend groups and stuff like that oh I meant to do my liquid blush first um we're gonna do rare beauty today so of course as mom I'm freaking out thinking like how am I gonna know if something's up am I gonna get a call from the camp like what if what if what if cause this is the first time I'm not really able to get like updates of what she's doing all throughout the day cause when she would stay with my parents or she would have a babysitter I would always be able to check in right that came out a little aggressive but we're gonna trust the process so few days ago we're a couple days into camp and I get a call from the camp I'm using the Winky Lux liquid eye by the way and a call from a school or a camp generally not a good thing first thoughts is she sick is she hurt is she having a bad time what's going on turns out I had nothing to worry about my girl had simply been pestering the councillors and camp director to call me to call me at home and see if she can stay for the second week because she's been having the absolute time of her life by the way ride or die right here I use this everyday for like in here and all over so we said yes and my go getter know what she wants independent Queen is killing at a camp and Mama had nothing to worry about
