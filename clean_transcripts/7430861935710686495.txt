I know, but it's like, it truly is a little bit like natural highlights. I don't know. Super cute. I don't think. I don't look at you ever and go, oh, she's got gray hair. Like, it's. It's cute. I feel like I'm slowly turning into my mom and my grandma, but, like, I thought my grandma was most beautiful woman, and I'm like, how cute. She's turning into her. I would be so. That's adorable. I'm super excited.
