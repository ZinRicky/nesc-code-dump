could I have cleaned my entire house in the time it took me to do this one bathroom? yes yes I couldâ€™ve and I feel like her and I might have a fair bit in common because she might look clean on the surface but once you get to know her you'll find out she's fkn filthy so this is the only bathroom we have in our house and it services my family of five we have other toilets thankfully so that when my husband runs off for three hours at a time I can actually access this one. anyway between the five of us and our endless rotation of house guests over summer this bathroom has taken an absolute beating the first step was to strip out the shower and then spray it within an inch of its life with mould killer and I let that marinate while I cracked on with this drawer and I really got no one to blame for this mess but myself in my defence end of last year was hectic I had an event or two to go to pretty much every single day plus we're renovating and we were hosting Christmas and New Years and house guests and I just haven't had a minute but it's January and I'm back on my shit again and I've decided that I'm getting my entire house deep cleaned decluttered and organised before well before I lose the motivation I guess and please don't judge the state of my brushes or my sponges okay I'm already judging me enough for the both of us I think I did five rounds of little baths for them and then when I was happy I set them out until the sun to dry when I got on with organising the rest of my makeup I like to organise my makeup by categories if you know what I mean so I got a section for eyes and brows a section for lips a section for face a section for my palettes that sort of thing and then on the other side I wanted to try and actually make some space for the rest of my family so I've got all of our hair stuff in one basket and then our oral hygiene stuff in the other basket Side note but I'm trying to manifest two more bathrooms in this house by the end of the year this year tall order I know but I need to put a bathroom in downstairs for my sons and I need to put an ensuite in you know, for me and then I imagine my daughter and my husband will share this bathroom until she gets old enough and kicks him out too and so yes I will admit this bathroom is absolutely overflowing with product but just remember no actually I can't even say thereâ€™s 5 of us sharing it cause this is all my shit I like skincare okay arrest me I organised all my face stuff into brands and then on this side I've got hair and body care and then once the section of the bathroom was organised it was time to get cracking on the deep clean and honestly this is my favourite part I do like organising but I just like cleaning better but honestly organising this bathroom is such a punish cause it's so tiny so what you didn't see was me off camera sitting in the hallway with three kids and a dog going through each and every one of my products trying to decide what to keep and what was expired and where was my husband throughout all of this I hear you asking he was at golf not even a word of a lie but I was happy for him he doesn't golf often I think it's important for him to go out and have guy time, whatever. plus this is my happy place and if he was here trying to help me I'd be pissed off by now telling him to get the fk out I decided to try the TikTok baking soda and vinegar Hack down the drain don't know if it was doing anything but it felt like it was doing something and then I just steamed everything as much as I possibly could honestly that steamer is my favourite gadget it was the best purchase of 2023 you would have heard me say it before my only regret is that I didn't get all of my cleaning appliances sooner honestly if my children ever decide to get married not to each other obviously, to other people I'm gonna get them all new cleaning appliances as their wedding presents I just feel like a new family needs to start off with new cleaning appliances then you can take care of them and hopefully keep them for years and years my dad's always known how much I love to clean I take after my mum in that respect and so when I got married he decided to get me a washing machine yeah it was second hand I think it cost him 50 bucks and we had to go pick it up ourselves not to sound ungrateful but I really didn't wanted to clean my wedding present before I got to use it you know what I mean don't come at me that he was probably hard up against it or he just paid for our wedding cause neither of those are applicable anyway love my dad probably would have loved him more if he got me a brand new washing machine ðŸ¤­ 12 years later and she's still obviously still a bit salty about it Nah, it's just funny now sorry about the rant dad. anyway we're on the homestretch now and it's time to clean out the final cupboard and i wonâ€™t lie I saved this one til last because I seriously considered just not doing it but I wanted to do it because I wanted to give my husband a little space and by â€˜a little spaceâ€™ I mean he now has two shelves ðŸ˜‡ look at me being all generous & shit but seriously last time I did this I had a bunch of comments from people telling me that it didn't leave my husband enough room okay firstly he has like 3 products he doesn't need a bunch of space secondly he knows he's welcome to share anything in this bathroom and he uses the skincare behind the mirror too And thirdly I don't know what it is about guys or maybe it's just my guy but he looks really good with wrinkles so can you blame me for gatekeeping some of my anti ageing shit wow okay we've really covered some ground in this one and I apologise but I also can't help but spin a yarn Ok. I'm officially over it now my feet are aching my back is aching my mouth is aching from all of this shit talk and even though I didn't fill up my drawers with teeny tiny mouthwashes and teeny tiny toothpicks and teeny tiny other shit that I probably don't need look itâ€™s a realistic reset I guess but it does kinda make me wonderâ€¦
