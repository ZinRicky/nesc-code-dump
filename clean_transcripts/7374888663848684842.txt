Marriage isn't hard, life is One thing that I've Learned is once you become a domestic partner where you live together love in your relationship also has to be accompanied by an attitude of wanting to make each other's lives better When you have the mindset of my goal is to love this person as well as I can to make their life a little bit easier that will make any marriage last that's the true goal I know that life can be challenging So it's really important that we find a partner who doesn't add to the stress of everyday life Marriage should be there to make the hard things easier Love is NOT about flowers or gifts or what you can give your partner materialistically love is seeing your partner face a challenge and want to help them you step up to help any way that you can For example if my husband is very stressed with work maybe he's had a long day and he doesn't have time to make himself a meal Iâ€™ll instantly get up and make him a meal because that's what marriage is about helping each other if I'm stressed out maybe I haven't gotten to the chores the household chores then he steps up and cleans the whole house for me that's what marriage is about stepping up for your partner when they need help Having a partner who has love but also has the attitude to want to make your life easier That is what marriage is all about Marriage isn't hard, life is.
