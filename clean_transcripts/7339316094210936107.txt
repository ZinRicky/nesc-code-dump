you should go to bed when your partner does if you want a happy marriage or relationship you should always remember that going to bed together is one of the most important parts of the day yes I know you're probably like ugh but I'm not tired when they are, or they snore, or I need to get X y and Z done before bed so many couples don't go to bed together instead one will stay up to watch TV or get work done often you'll find that couples that don't go to bed together don't spend a lot of quality time together theyâ€™re losing their connection or spark which ends up leading to an unhappy marriage or relationship, or even worse, divorce. please make an effort to go to bed together, discuss your day together, cuddle, embrace each other with warmth! simply just spend the last moments of each day together if you want a happy long lasting marriage/relationship
