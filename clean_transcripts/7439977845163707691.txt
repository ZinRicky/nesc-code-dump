okay you guys I found the perfect Christmas gift for parents it's an aura frame they don't have TikTok though so they won't know that this is what I'm getting but it's a super cool digital picture frame and what you do is you download the free aura app you add photos to it and then the photos pop up on the frame you can invite multiple friends and family members to also upload their own photos so I think it'll be cool to show them vacations we're on or things we're doing when we're far away and it even plays videos so I can randomly surprise them throughout the day with different videos and things that me and the kids are doing it's so genius I think every parent and grandparent would love to have one of these and you can use this code to get $45 off right now
