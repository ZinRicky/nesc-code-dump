Avoidant attachment disorder. This is one of the first attachment disorders that Doctor Erica Commissar discusses in her recently published book, being there why prioritizing motherhood in the first three years matters. Avoidant attachment disorder is probably the easiest one for me to discuss because I already firsthand know so many people that have this attachment disorder and you can see it triggle down in every aspect of their life, especially relationships and dating. These are the babies that did not experience enough emotional connection while they were in their infancy, become emotionally distant and avoid connection as a form of coping mechanism in order to deal with the lack of responsiveness from a caregiver. So if mom is not being emotionally connected to her baby, picking her up when baby cries. Speaking of which, one second back to what I was saying. As adults, these people appear to be very independent, self reliant. They struggle with close relationships and may even be best friend hoppers, and they greatly suppress their emotions or even deny them all together. And lastly, when these avoidant individuals enter a relationship that becomes somewhat serious and it's necessary to open up emotionally, they experience a ridiculous amount of stress. And in my experience, a lot of them end up self sabotaging said relationship because in their eyes, anything would be better than opening up emotionally because they were let down so much when they were babies. Even though it's all subconscious and they don't Really remember it? Every time they weren't picked up, when they cried, every time they didn't feel connected to a mom. Maybe she had postpartum. Maybe she just wasn't there. They had to go within themselves and create a defense mechanism and a coping style, which became the avoidant attachment disorder. Drop a comment below. I guarantee you have dated someone or known someone with this avoidant attachment disorder. Sir, you are being so loud.
