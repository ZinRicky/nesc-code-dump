I have been itching to deep clean this pool ever since we moved in here about 18 months ago and my husband has always vetoed any plans that I've had to deep clean around the pool and as much as I hate to admit it he's probably right probably not the best idea to water blast a whole lot of gunk into a full pool but now that it's empty I cannot tell you how excited I am I have been waiting for this day and not just cause I find water blasting extremely fkn cathartic on its own and not just cause I knew that these grout lines were gonna come up so good but and I hate the term but I would consider myself a clean freak right so I was sitting poolside all summer long last summer watching the kids and I swear all I could see was this grotty as grout and whenever I was in the pool or maybe sitting on the edge of the pool or in the spa I was .. disgusted if I'm honest don't already know we are insane we're currently DIY pool renovating a 50 year old pool with no pool renovation experience and these I believe are the original bricks so most will be 50 years old they have seen some things I imagine that they've had a good life a few have been replaced and many of them have big chips and gouges taken out of them just the wear and tear of a space well loved But theyâ€™re also covered in mould and algae mineral deposits probably pool chemicals sunscreen and organic materials from just the weather after so long of wanting to do it it felt so good to give them a good deep clean we've been battling this algae infestation ever since we moved in constantly scrubbing it adjusting the chemicals but now that it's drained I was able to really get in there and give it a good blast off it felt so good but until we reseal this plaster which we will in another video we'll just keep battling this issue because the concrete is porous at the moment and so the algae just lives inside the holes and just keeps coming back? by the way I didn't know if I was just tripping but at the start of this the pool was most definitely white right but I swear if you look at it now you can see blue peeking through which makes me think that it must have been blue once and then maybe it was painted but pretty much all of that white paint is gone anyway cause in so many spots it's just bare concrete anyway in the last video we chipped off all of those tiles I'll link it in the caption if you wanna go back and watch cause that was oddly satisfying now we're priming all around the waterline ready to lay our new tiles quick reminder of where we started and this is where we've got to here's a sneak peek of the tile and I'm posting in real time so I'm so sorry but come back soon
