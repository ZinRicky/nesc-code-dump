Cookie dough ice cream was always my first choice when I was younger, but since I'm not able to find one with healthy ingredients, I like to make my own. I find that many people are shocked when they find out what it takes to make ice cream. This ice cream maker attachment is a must. I pour my raw, uncooked ingredients into a frozen bowl as it turns and within 20 minutes I have thick yet soft vanilla ice cream with an orange hue. Thanks to my pasture raised chickens, I let that firm up in the freezer and then freshly mill my regeneratively grown flour. I want my kids to know what a true cookie dough ice cream experience tastes like, so this is an important part. Combine my wet ingredients melted butter, egg, vanilla, and four tablespoons of coconut sugar with my dry ingredients whole grain flour, baking soda, and unrefined salt. Lastly, I massage coarsely chopped good ingredient chocolate chunks into my cookie dough, making little cookie balls that I organize on a Parchment lined baking sheet. This is put in the freezer for a short while and then I store them in a jar until they are ready to be. This is homemade ice cream, so it requires some extra time to soften up on the counter before scooping. There's no gums or stabilizers. One or two scoops per bowl topped with fresh cookie dough brings me back to my childhood and it makes me So happy that my kids have a healthy treat that they can themselves make for the rest of their lives.
