I'm up late canning Turkey broth from Thanksgiving. It's been sitting on the stove for days, and out of nowhere, I run out of propane, which I knew was running out because I started smelling the propane, which is not the propane. It's like a chemical they add in. Anyway, this electric canner has saved my broth.
