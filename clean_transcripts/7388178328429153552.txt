the guy who brought up at least six or seven times how he was no one nagging okay you need to be able to spot it when I was 23 or something I read the game the book the game it's like the Bible there's obviously a lot more content now but back in the day it was the original book for those Intels those um dating coach guys all the guys were reading it whether or not they admit it they were already and I wanted to know how to beat them at their own game and to spot a gamer in the wild surprised me how many women in the comments don't know what nagging is don't know what the game is when I talk about it people still don't know what is you need to know just the other week month maybe I was gamed like fully by like an MRA style guy and I could recognise it after about five or 10 minutes of it I could recognise it you need to know women you need to know what is happening so I'm gonna go over some of the key things and I honestly employ you to do your own research cause men are out there doing these things and this woman talks about how helpful it was to be on the other side of it honestly I don't think she knew what it was I'd I'm not 100% sure that that's what it was but it sounds like it very much could have been nagging reason I need you to know this is cause it's a manipulation tool that men use to get in your pants if a man is using it he is likely not the kind of guy that you want to be with he likely doesn't respect women he likely sees you as an object as a goal something to win at I don't want you out there not knowing how to recognise a gamer No. 1 nagging already mentioned it involves giving a backhanded compliment getting her self esteem down so that then you're the only one who can get it up again if you feel really good then slide a really like subtle little hint in that you know a negative hint in that you're not that great and then the idea she's gonna feel like she has to work to get your approval back again cause you've made her feel so good in the first place then you'd slipped in something in there that wasn't that great and then she's gonna like struggle with her self esteem and she's gonna think you're the only person who can bring it back up again so then she's going to you to bring it back back up again it is like No.1 in the rule book okay this is when a guy dresses like in like he's clearly a straight guy it might not just be sense of style he's like wearing an item that is designed to spark attention or be a conversation starter once you see it you can't unsee it and I'm not against men and their self expression and men wearing things that I am not I am a huge advocate for it peacocking is when a man literally wears it to start a conversation with a woman and you know when you know ideas you stand out from other men and attract the attention of women and it'll be a conversation starter in another self it's like not that bad when paired with everything else it is now the third one is demonstrating high value so they'll talk about high value low value you would have heard this it's all over the internet still these days um but the like men are told to like tell stories about themselves that demonstrate that they're like higher value men stories that highlight like their wealth or social status things like that before they have three second rule the idea is like to approach a woman within three seconds of noticing her um dating coaches use it to encourage men not to like brew on like a fear of rejection so that's just another one to keep in mind so a method called the mystery method which is just like a method that they use to like get you from step to step from like strangers to intimacy there's also a method called Keeno escalation which is about like slowly and subtly like using more and more physical touch um to get you used to the idea of physical touch and to build like sexual tension they might also use a false time concern so that's the idea of like I'm busy I've got to go I've got to get somewhere soon which is designed to make you feel really much more comfortable like oh he's leaving anyway so I can like open up or like he's leaving anyway so like I don't have to worry about anything happening but it's false if the isolation is in there the goal is to separate the woman from her friends so you know look out for that one to like maintain control of the interaction in the conversation so there are various techniques used to like maintain control um so that the conversation and the interaction goes in the favour of the man to make him look good to ensure that he in the end achieves his goal and gets what he wants I don't want you panicking and I don't want you saying the negative and everything but I also don't want you manipulated and into like false intimacy and false interactions by men who honestly are just gonna do this to the next girl I just think it's best you just know what's happening so that you can employ this knowledge to your advantage as well so some examples are a guy says to you I saw you across the room and I just couldn't wait I had to come over I might use lines that seem like they could be used anywhere or rehearse like oh you know like imagine if you could have a dinner party with three dead people who would they be and they might use this item anyone you know at any time so they often will have those type of pre rehearsed kind of conversation starters they might be wearing like a Fedora or like I don't know like colourful leggings or something like that those weird sunglasses um like you know novelty novelty sunglasses or like you know a feather Boer they might say like give you a compliment this backhanded like wow you've got such a beautiful nose like is it real or has anyone ever told you you look like Lena Dunham but like I mean that in a good way I'm using that cause that was when I got for bragging like you know I was in Brazil last month like working like you know have you ever been there like it's so beautiful have you ever been to South America low escalation of touching your hand touching your shoulder touching your thigh out for oh I can only stay a minute but I just wanted to ask you something thing you like oh my God you look like a nerd but like in a cute way I bet you were a nerd in high school for God's sakes if a guy pulls out a magic trick run goes without saying anyway I love you I wish you all the best I hope this was helpful
