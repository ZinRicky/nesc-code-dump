is having kids selfish in my comment section defending the child free people like to use this word selfish to either describe not having kids or opposite having kids so here's my take as a mom of three every decision you make in your entire life where you factor in your personal happiness is selfish or could be called selfish by somebody else anything you do where you factor yourself in you are thinking of yourself therefore could be selfish here's the caveat selfish is not a bad thing it's like that episode of friends where Phoebe went on a quest to find a selfless act of good and she couldn't find one and that's kind of how I really think about it but now we're gonna deep dive a little bit into society okay because certain choices have to be made in order for humankind to survive and appropriating having children is one of them I don't believe in the argument that you need to have kids in order to be taken care of in your old age I think that's um you're putting a lot of eggs in your basket and number two there's plenty of nursing homes filled with people who had children who have nobody left okay kids are people you may not have a good relationship with your kids as they get older but if you are alone in a nursing home someone's child is taking care of you which means your survival is dependent upon someone else having children and I think that is why parents get their panties in a twist when you say having kids is selfish because you will depend on that as you get older everyone we all will that's how community and species continuation happens may not be your offspring that you depend on but it is somebody's now I'm not saying there aren't parents who have kids for selfish reasons of course there are there are people with kids who should have never had children and there are people without kids who would have made amazing parents and there's people without kids who would have been terrible parents but arguing that one choice and I'm talking about the child free by choice people not people who happen to end up child free by circumstance but the child free by choice people are no more selfish than people who have children for their own selfish reasons meaning obligations later in life to live vicariously through their kids um because the Joneses are doing it but I think honestly calling anyone selfish for living life in a way that makes them happy is bullshit so what so what so what if it's selfish so what selfish is not a four letter word to a degree I think we all know the selfish assholes okay like I'm not talking about those people but if you go in somebody's comments who is either child free by choice or is a parent and you feel the need to tell them that their choice was the selfish one fuck off just just fuck right off because all the choices are selfish
