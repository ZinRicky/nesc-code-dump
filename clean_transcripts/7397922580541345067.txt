People that have been around for a while know how much I love hourglass and how much I love blush. When they came out with these new liquid blushes, I knew that I had to try them and I instantly fell in love. They have such a natural finish, but they're still buildable. They're super easy to apply, so I usually start by applying them on the high points of my cheek and then blend them out before moving on to my nose and my brow bone. Come in so many different colors, but this one has been my favorite one lately. And then I have to finish off with a glossy lip to match my blush.
