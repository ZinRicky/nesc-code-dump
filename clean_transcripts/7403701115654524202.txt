I feel like the internet needs some basic rules of engagement making tens of thousands of people think that you are in a crisis situation or you or your children's life might be in state because your husband is going through a mental health crisis when in reality you're just telling a story about what happened a few months ago because you want this to go out you know to as many people as possible to raise awareness and help it really rubs me the wrong way it's obviously not the worst thing that someone has done for clicks and views however it's really difficult to watch people continuously cross boundaries of like what is normal rational and sane just for a platform just for some views it's getting really frustrating to watch just like lack of basic fucking decorum like I understand that the situation that happened to you and you wanted to paint the picture right but like you have said hey story time right like this is what happened a few months ago making it seem as if you are currently in an abusive situation with a man where there is potential for like life threatening issues and like lives at risk for the sake of a better story is weird and wrong and you should not have done that I wish people in general reevaluated the way they act on the internet and reevaluated their own like moral limits on the internet just like in general I I think that we are really losing the fucking plot and losing how to interact with basic human decency on the internet and we are forgetting like the impact of what we do in the name of going viral in the name of you know getting some money in the name of you know getting some followers the internet is like a public town square right like it works the best when we are just being basically decent human beings and making tens of thousands of people think that you are currently actively in danger life threatening danger is not cool please reevaluate
