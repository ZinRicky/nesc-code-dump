if you're a homeschooling mom to a preschooler and you need something to do over the summer break this is a great way to start our alphabet we already do the good and beautiful preschool curriculum but this is a great way to help my daughter practice her apple case and lowercase letters she absolutely loved that it was ice cream which really engaged her and the colours made it so much easier for her to focus these are solid pieces the quality feels amazing and they will last a lifetime easy to clean and wipe down and so much fun for the whole family to play with do we mash all the letters up we started lining them up in the alphabets this also helped her get her alphabet down I don't know why they're still in stock before the home school runs
