I try to eat breakfast within 60 minutes of waking and today I had grass fed patties pasture eggs onions and rice cause my brain needs some carbs to function then I do apple cider vinegar for digestion and blood sugar regulation you guys know I love my Shilajit and organs and then recently I've been on a sardine kick while you eat a whole can it's just a great way to get protein and micronutrients then for lunch we have burgers again and what I like to do is I just take the fat from my roasted chickens that I save and I use that to pan sear my seasoned little burger patties throw it up with some lettuce and some onions and this case guacamole cause Zach requested it mid meal it's bomb and then we polished off some pickles so then I had to make some more pickles I swear we've been eating steak almost every day and in this case you do a rib eye with some mushrooms and onions and it was so good
