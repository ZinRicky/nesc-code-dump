so I'm doing my makeup getting ready for the day and I decided I wanna try out a new product for y'all um I just got this deepology uh it's called a serum stick but it's supposed to have some coverage um I use their skincare and I like it but I've I've been very hesitant to try like skincare and makeup in one because I'm such like a makeup girly so I wanted to try this out and see wait let me get the beauty thing off okay we have skin and it says to like put it on your skin and blend it out oh it's already getting like a really good glow okay you can use this under makeup it says it's a balm to serum that works to minimize visible sense of aging soothing hydrating and locking in moisture so it's very smooth and hydrating I love this I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup and see how it feels under foundation is super smooth under so makeup is done you can still see and feel the hydration if you have dry skin this is the perfect under makeup product
