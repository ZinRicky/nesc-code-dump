Okay, I'll show you what I've been making every morning. So I squeeze some lemons first. The two lemons. And I have this chlorophyll put in 14 shakes then. Okay, so then I put a little bit of maple syrup in, and then I put some of our new, um, blueberry, petal and lemon. French saltine. Stuff is so incredible. Just put a pinch of this in my electrolytes on the bench.
