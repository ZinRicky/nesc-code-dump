I think one of the top things that Democrats have to do in the selection is reclaim patriotism. Like, how are the people who want to destroy the uniquely American things about this country, like freedom and liberty to do whatever the fuck you want with your body? How are the people who wanna destroy that freedom and liberty? Why do they have a claim on patriotism? If you want to make America better, that's because you love America. That's patriotism. Don't let them steal that away from you.
