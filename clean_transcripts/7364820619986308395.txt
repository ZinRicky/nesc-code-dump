custom by Fat Fab Feminist so I was wrong um okay I made a video about these glosses and how I really didn't like them and to be fair I really didn't like them when I first started the problem is this is a really really thick gloss and for some reason the way this applicator works um it just does not pick up the amount of gloss that I need to have like a super saturated lip right like when it's on it feels thick and it feels nice it does I really like the way it feels um and I've been wearing this with my Palladio lip stain because this combo awesome amazing love it um however this I just like the color not for me never use this um so I am going to change the color I'm gonna try and change the color I don't actually know if this is gonna work um but I've seen Daus Mendoza actually make a clear gloss into a different color so I'm like okay if you can take a clear gloss um and make it into a different color then I'm assuming I'm assuming if I add color to this should I try to take this off maybe I should try to take it off but I'm assuming if I add a color to this it will also change I'm taking this old morphe palette that I don't really use and I think I'm gonna go in oh I think I'm gonna go in with some red these are probably blue and make it more usable this this and this color let's see let's see what the vibe is is this bad just like tapping it in maybe imagine this doesn't work and I just like ruin lip gloss okay so but I would feel bad ruining I don't I don't like wasting things um I grew up like with a family who was poor like I didn't grow up poor very privileged to have grown up with everything I ever needed but my parents are both immigrants and they grew up poor so they had that like mentality of poverty basically um and so they grew up the way that I grew up like they kind of still have that mindset so even though like we were financially secure um my dad did not like get the memo um so I just like we didn't throw things away like not hoarders obviously however hoarder tendencies I will say so I don't know why I'm telling all this to the internet girl just make your video something is happening I don't know if it's something that I want to be happening wait so I can't I can't go to the bottom so everything else is changing color but this isn't also I don't know what color I'm going for I just want something that's more usable on my lips we should have done a swatch beforehand but you know what you can tell that color is not gonna work on me sorry for ruining your lip gloss R.E.M beauty oh see one swipe of this is just not enough because it's like there isn't enough of a slip for it to like be smooth hmm but when I pack it on oh I'm a genius I'm literally a genius I'm literally a genius do I wanna add more the thing is I also have too much gene and I'm like maybe I could add more I think i’m gonna add more is it like a mad scientist like scraping and mixing and scraping and mixing and like customizing get me in the makeup lab actually that's what you need to do get me in the lab I can do it look at this custom color do you think it'll work should I do that way mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix honestly this is a little bit similar to my favorite gloss of the moment which is the Tower 28 Milky Jelly um it's got a little purple which is cute but I think I want more red sorry absolutely destroying this palette I'm Stan and I was wrong I singing the Stan’s wrong song I was playing that in my head the entire time I was getting ready to make this video I just like it also it's like so cool you can just like make your own shit you can just customize anything you want there's no rules isn't that awesome isn’t it awesome that you can just like do whatever you want like no one's being harmed in this video I'm sure there's gonna be people who are like why would you destroy lip gloss I'm sorry I'm not British I'm from Staten Island though unfortunately and I feel like there are definitely Staten Island girls who at least at a period of time really liked concealer lips no shade or hate to Staten Island girls but otherwise I don't know actually you know what another demographic uses that color I think women who do like um like brown lip liner and like a light light like middle also use that lip color I'm just not one of them like I'll do a brown lip I'm just yapping I'll just do like a brown lip liner and then I like a little red or pinky in the middle but it needs to have some color goodness Gracian yes okay Joey Graceffa what is wrong with me I don't know I'm just like yapping okay guys I think this is a awesome colour pretty and then people will be like oh my god what lip gloss are you wearing sorry custom my bad guys I'm just like what am I saying the way that I've been doing this for 10 minutes and I was literally cut off mid yap but tell me tell me it's not worth it tell me this is not the most perfect color oh my god oh I'm so happy I kinda love this again this gloss is best when you like pack it on uh in my opinion and it is really thick so if you don't like a thick glosses don't use this don't buy this don't get mad at me I would definitely wear a liner with this oh god that was so fun okay done this is the aftermath okay this is the aftermath of the palette it's still honestly usable if I needed to use it I just like I haven't done anything fun with makeup in a while and then my friend Madison just gave me all this like makeup products and I've been playing with makeup so much more now I again I don't know how this is going to last I don't know if like this is you know a problem for the pigment I I don't quote me I don't know anything this is you know as much as I do but I think awesome color I'm so happy perfect okay cute now that we're here do I ruin this one too no but this one's not ruined I really like this maybe just like a little bit of red maybe just like a little bit of red maybe just like a little bit of red maybe just like a little bit of red because it is a little light for me too much gene too much gene don't say anything I don't wanna hear I don't wanna hear it I've also used a lot of this like I've had this for like a couple weeks not much I want you guys to know that I've been doing this for 15 minutes now I have two custom lip glosses sometimes I love being a person custom by Fat Fab Feminist why did I don't know why this brought me so much joy I literally cannot tell you I am like over the moon right now I do not know why this is just made me so happy I just love that you can do stuff I just like life is so fun
