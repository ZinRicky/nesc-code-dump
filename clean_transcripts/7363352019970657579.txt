hi hello life update I washed my hair this is what it looks like when I don't diffuse it or do anything and then it'll it won't be super fluffy and like great today but I just needed to shower I've been feeling um stressed and down moving is just the thought of moving is stressful just the fact of moving but um I did come to a conclusion my boyfriend and I where we are gonna take the step and move in together the first conversation we had was over text and then when we talked in person we were able to clear up some misunderstandings we both had and then since then we've just kind of put it on the you know on the side table and then like okay when we think about it we'll talk about it but we're not gonna force it or anything like we'll just continue to think about it and so we have and we just continue to have like conversations like are you sure what if one of us loses our job like we've just had a lot of super duper open conversations which was nice so and then uh so it made me feel like we got closer in the last like just two weeks of just even thinking about it and talking about it and then I was like okay yeah this does feel like it makes sense I've had many many conversations with my kids and they all feel super comfortable with it so that's the direction we're going and I'm super excited I'm just sure like moving is just really shitty and stressful so um yeah I guess if you wanna see me move I don't know why I don't show sometimes I'm like nobody wants to see the shit that I'm doing they just wanna hear my I don't know and then I'm like nobody wants to hear my opinion I don't know but if you want if you want me to show you me moving and packing and shit or whatever I don't know let me know what you want to see from me so I don't wanna feel so distant I know sometimes I just get down and like avoid social media cause it becomes so overwhelming especially with like so much attention sometimes you know I didn't realize how but I mean I did realize how huge the CNN article was gonna be but the other appearances and stuff it's opened up is like wow this is like like I don't know like seeing your fucking face on fucking TV my TikToks that I film in my kitchen that I'm like feel like I'm just talking to friends and then they're on fucking TV and then I'm here talking about it I don't know that shit is just it's so crazy it's so surreal so I think my mind has been a bit in a whirl a bit of a woo and it's like the end of the school year anyway I'm sorry I'm blabbering let me know what you wanna see for me I love you and I'm moving in with my boyfriend
