thank you for your input I think a lot of women have this feeling that this is a negative thing to be “lead by a man” however, men usually earn our respect by taking lead. this doesn't mean that he's controlling your life or bossing you around, saying that you want a man to lead doesn't mean that you want a tyrant boss. when I say we want men to lead. it means that he's able to demonstrate his capability, responsibility, and assertiveness in the relationship. He knows what he's doing and you can value his insight and decision making they get things done so we can admire and respect them for getting things done They make us feel safe, even in the worst times he’ll have a plan so you can depend on him. so when I mean lead, it's not that you're just in the back burner. he's leading because there can't be two leaders in the relationship, Not only that do you really want to lead the relationship? I've been in relationships where I have been the leader and it's exhausting, we don't want to be the ones stressing, worrying about everything, making sure things get done. That puts you in your masculine energy when a man takes lead, it allows you to be in your feminine energy, allowing you the freedom to be joyful and happy, be at peace with yourself. I'm not sure where the negative connotation of having a man lead came from but it's not a bad thing. we're taking it as a bad thing, where “we're allowing men to walk all over us and wear their doormats” that's not the case, when you find a good man it's like Yin and Yang you both balance each other out, you both are equal in value, but you operate in different roles. yes you can lead yourself, but that's not very successful in a relationship, There can only be one king and one queen. you can't both sit on the throne and wear the pants. yes, you can lead yourself, but what's the point of that in a relationship? what are you gaining out of leading?
