Let's make some homemade kombucha. I started falling in love with kombucha a few years ago and quickly realized that the cost of kombucha in stores is very high. So I figured out how to make it on my own. And I'm so glad that I did, because now is become a seasonal favorite in our household. If you're unfamiliar with kombucha, it is simply fermented tea. I love it so much because it tastes great. It usually has quite a bit of carbonation. It has a lot of pre and probiotics that helps with digestion. And it has natural caffeine in it because of the black tea. 10 out of ten.
