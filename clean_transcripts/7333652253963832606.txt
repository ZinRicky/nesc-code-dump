I genuinely mourn who I could have been like the person that I could have been if I didn't have like ADHD just making a video about it and I didn't realize how heavily my life has been impacted by this thing like every aspect of my life like my depression my you know weight my you know movement my desire to get out of bed is all impacted by my ADHD I I can't communicate with my friends like I I'm so bad at like literally just texting my friends back I don't know what it is my brain can't do it unless I'm medicated but first of all I haven't been able to get my medication in literally months because of the shortage like I went to CVS last week and and my pharmacist was like we have a list five pages long of people who can't get their vyvance like it's not just you and every time I take my meds I'm like reminded of like what it's like to be able to like function like a person like having ADHD means that you're fighting with your brain all the time it's like my brain is like on self destruct mode all the time and like ah like there are people that just like don't have to fight with themselves to do basic daily tasks and it's just so frustrating and ADHD is literally so debilitating and I would genuinely not wish this on my worst enemy and I know like social media like kind of has diminished what ADHD is or like has made it oh I'm just like a quirky manic pixie dream girl like no like this like this is the most disabling thing about my life more so than being a large fat person my life is more so impacted by my ADHD I have such bad executive functioning issue I'm so bad at doing anything alone not because like I it it it my brain literally is in like buffer mode 90% of the day unless I see someone and I just I wonder what would have happened if a I got diagnosed earlier I I love my parents and I'm not blaming them for this but like they were told when I was in preschool that my my teacher thought that I had ADHD but first of all my parents are immigrants so like that they don't believe in that but also like growing up as a girl the way that ADHD presents in US is different than the way that it presents in boys so like so many girls don't get diagnosed at a young age with ADHD and I just a like wonder what the trajectory of my life would have been had I gotten like a diagnosis early on and like had tools to to exist because now in my adulthood like I feel like I'm just catching up to all the things that I like failed at in my childhood like especially school as like I genuinely crave and desire to learn but school was so hard for me like I just I it was so difficult for me and I didn't understand why it was so hard for me compared to everyone I just thought I was lazy like I was I just thought that I was lazy like maybe I was but it wasn't completely that god I'm sorry I'm crying I'm just like uh but like now I know it was literally just my brain like when I was younger one of my favorite things in the entire world was to read and then I was like I was like 12 I think when I was 12 I read maybe 200 books and then school started getting more difficult and I had to do my readings for school but I like my brain couldn't do that so then I felt guilty reading books so for literally 10 years I stopped reading from the time that I was like 12 to the time that I was like 22 I graduate I like stopped reading for pleasure and it was one of my favorite things in the world to do like last year I finally read I've read 38 books my goal was 40 I didn't make it but this year hopefully it will but like I just read for pleasure because I could because I didn't have assignments I had to do that were like weighing on me so I could just like read again but also now I feel like I'm like so behind in like the things that I should have cause I didn't do any of my readings in college and I didn't do any of my readings in in high school because like my brain didn't want to but I want to bring those like I'm interested in them so now I'm reading the books that I should have read in high school and in college I feel like I wasted my degree and I like wasted my time because I didn't learn as much as I could have because I have the desire to learn I want to know but like my brain just like wasn't meant to do it in an academic setting like my ADHD also affected my disorder eating like I was binge eating in high school because um I didn't have enough dopamine and food is the easiest way to increase your dopamine but like if I had just if I had just dealt with my ADHD it's just this has been the most difficult part of my life the most disabling thing in my life is my ADHD and it's just so heartbreaking and more than anything the thing that I I I regret the most is that like I've let it affect my like relationship I have had so many friends business partners brands like lose broke relationships with them burnt bridges just because I'm incapable of answering emails and DMs and texts and like whatever like my closest friends the only way that they can communicate with me is through Facetime because I literally I don't know I think it's pathological demand avoidance I'm not sure if I think that's what it's called but I just like I I literally am like I can't do anything that I am supposed to do and so I have burnt so many bridges unintentionally because of my brain and just my it's like and it's so so stupid like responding but it's so it gets so overwhelming and every day I like sit here and I just I think about like the people that like I no longer have in my life or like the connections that I can no longer rely on because I ruined that relationship and also like people probably think I hate them because I'm not responding cause if I text to someone and they didn't respond to me I would think that they hate me but I do the same thing and it just like it it's just my brain so I have to apologize to every single new person that I ever meet and be like I'm so sorry I can't I I can't text like call me anyways I'm sorry I'm like I I'm sorry for the big rant but I guess reminder that ADHD is a disability like that's what it is and I think because you know everyone deals with it differently and I think it looks different in different people and like I think because so many people have it we forget but like ADHD is a disability and it is a disabling thing to live with I don't know I I I would like to find the right meds cause vyvance like it works obviously a little bit but like not well enough and I I need to find new meds that I can actually get and that actually like work anyways if you have ADHD let the serve as a reminder that you are definitely not alone
