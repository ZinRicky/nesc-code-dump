anyone else ever have a parent or mother tell them that they cannot leave the house unless they look presentable my mom would literally stop me in my tracks and tell me what are you doing change out of those sweats brush your hair so I grew up with the idea that you always had to look presentable you don't have to you know put on a ball gown but look presentable and that is one of the greatest gifts my mom passed down to me if you look presentable this will open so many doors for you people be kinder to you more generous I'm not saying that's all you should have going for you but if you look presentable Most people will wanna be your friend youâ€™ll probably get a promotion at work your life will genuinely be way easier so if your mom never taught you this Before you leave the house make sure you look a little presentable
