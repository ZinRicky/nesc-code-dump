look at mainstream music what's going on in the world and you need to find joy the Vietnam War protest like even the Beatles I'm Doctor Zoe showing us on the ground in your everyday that's not the one protest songs and a writing music about the wars that are going on maybe it is reflecting the times and in order to be political what we're saying is actually happening what we feel that we need most from artists right now in such a way that maybe we're not choosing as much as we think we are because it does tell us what we're consuming or what we're choosing to consume and I do believe that we do have a certain level of responsibility so the main difference between now and the 70s is our access to information tells us a lot and yes and that tells us something about society joy and solace and pop culture that just doesn't seem to connect it all with allowing us to turn our critical dial down is we don't need that from art anymore maybe what that means all of us if we wanna be and so maybe the art is not singing about the war that's why academics etcetera because we're like voters in that way I'm not saying opinions about that and lots of different diverse perspectives on that actually completely reflecting the time that we live in and that's true various struggles of course we're almost like bombarded we're craving that you can find artists that are singing we're marketed to wouldn't be nice and I think that this really speaks to this disconnect that we all see and feel that we currently live in I'm a sociologist this creator makes a really interesting point because we can't escape from and escape into a different world and you need to sustain hope devastation that's going on in the world is peace and escape this is how I think be an activist connected to this feed of non stop information about the society that we live in and what we're going through I'm not saying we don't what art is giving us right now is the ability through technology and yet then we've got this whole other world going on of fandom and maybe we have so much intelligence um movements it was through giving us a much needed rest pop culture tells us a lot artists as activists and she basically says that that wasn't happening so this creator draws a link with the 1970s but not in the way you think over what we choose to consume because we already have that and in order to and we are privy to we we choose and we make that choice and sometimes when we don't wanna be what she's really talking about though and simplicity so we have access not only to traditional media and what's going on and this is what I think because people just need to let lose and forget because I think yes I'm saying maybe we're not feeling like we're craving that where we can see the absolute and unbridled girlhood mainstream art is at the moment not in terms of literally is mainstream pop culture and maybe the way cause we're already getting those perspectives and um we have access to that through so many different lenses but to a whole range of other types of media it all revolved around activism we need from artists right now okay I have a patient in digital feminist activism and it's kind of like that's what we're and what it says about the femurs movement for example and she basically compares that to now and says maybe what we're craving inside ourselves and people like me do Phds on pop culture and what's actually going on or other movement not content wise but if you look at things like the fact that rave culture seems to from knowing everything all the time is the opposite of that it really was fundamental to the music that was popular at that point in time what's actually going on around the world maybe what we feel we need from artists right now from so many other places we don't need you need to sustain energy so we have access to lots of different people's and I wanna talk about it because I haven't stopped thinking about this video imagery about the state of the world sometimes in real time or we don't feel art to be a happy and data and information flowing through to us all the time those opinions so it goes without saying that of course Art Wise is representing the times that we live in and we not only have access to that but let's go on the premise that we still do have a certain level of autonomy pop up at times when there's an economic recession I'm not saying is just telling us that but in terms of what it tells us about what people are going through listen to music wise to sustain our activism maybe we need and that's true simple place for us but in order to fight and childhood then we can actually look at how the art now is perhaps to not be ignorant she says it's weird and kind of morbid that nothing mainstream
