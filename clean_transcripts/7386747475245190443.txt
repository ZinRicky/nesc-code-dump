I was born in the 1900s so I might be a little old fashioned in the sense that I like to cook clean and satisfy my husband's needs there's nothing wrong with that some of y'all look people like to tell me otherwise or unhappy women who have been scorned by men and want to burn the whole world down I'm happy exactly how I am so is my husband so words of advice do whatever makes you happy
