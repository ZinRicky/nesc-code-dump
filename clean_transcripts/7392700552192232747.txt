Let's get ready for date night in, like, 20 minutes. I've already done my base and my eyebrows. I'm just gonna do, like, a really quick. I like a really light one, because I wanna do a full, bold red lip. We're going to a caviar bar tonight, which I think leads, like, dramatic, elegant. So I'm just doing a really, really light smoky eye. Like, just a teeny little touch, um, with this color in the crease, and then this one just in the outer corner. And I always do a little bit of this silk teddy just in this corner, and then I'll do my wing. I'm gonna go in with the tattoo liner and just do a little wing and drag that out. I usually connect the top and the bottom to make a little triangle, and then fill it in and then just connect it to the inner corner. Now for a red lip, I'm trying a new one. I've been really liking the Pat Mcgrath red, and this is actually gonna be Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood fixin. Now, I'm always on the hunt for a good red, and this is a good red. I've always liked Charlotte Tilbury's lipsticks. I know they're a little bit on the pricey side, but they go on creamy, and they are just, like, so hydrating and really pigmented, and I really love them. I'm gonna finish off with a little bit of highlight just up here on the cheek bone. Um, and this is benefit Watts Up. I've used it to hell. I fucking love it. It's really great. Um, but that's the whole makeup look. I'm gonna have to do a part two for getting dressed because I don't want this to be, like a seven minute long video. Um, so go for part two for the outfit.
