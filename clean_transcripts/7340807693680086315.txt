My kids have never had the opportunity to eat popular kid marketed foods because my food standards are really high and I prioritize health over convenience. Nevertheless, they can still enjoy these fun foods quite easily with a little bit of creativity and desire. Their friends at school eat goldfish at snack time and rather than feel like they're missing out, I decided to make some for my kids. A snack boxes to. The homemade version is so much more delicious like a savory shortbread. These are made with all purpose eincorn flour which gives them a lighter feel than if using freshly milled 100% whole grain flour. Eincorn is ideal for kids with gluten sensitivity as it doesn't upset the tummy. This all purpose flour contains 85% of the brand in this freshly milled order. So it's not like the other white flowers that have been sitting on the grocery shops for months and stripped up their nutrients. This five ingredient homemade goldfish is free of soybean oil and glyphosate sprayed wheat, so this is a definite win. One thing I forgot to add in was ground turmeric for yellow color, which I'll be sure to do next time so that we can have a perfect goldfish dupe.
