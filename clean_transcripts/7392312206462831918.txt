what do you do last minute when an outfit does not fit and you have to wear it out tomorrow here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna adapt um so my friend phaith is partnering with PLT and designed this outfit very very cute my fat ass doesn't really fit in it because there's no stretch and I'm like on the border of like a 26 28 and PLT goes up to 26 you see so there's no stretch doesn't usually work um my fault my bad so here's the thing this top if I had if I had to go out in this like I can make it work um only problem is like I feel as though if I breathe wrong this is it's coming out you know what I mean so here's the option and also this is not the way that this top is supposed to be wear like this this is not a strap it's supposed to go like right here but uh that's just is um this that wouldn't work so what we're gonna do is we're gonna adapt and we're gonna scrap the top I'm just like sorry love you can't wear it what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put on this set from Pretty Little Thing which is like one of the most iconic sets right I'm gonna use a skirt as a top and I'm gonna pair with these two things that's the vibe in case you're curious this is this is kind of how the this this is what I put around my neck um and I kind of ripped it but like this like is a very precarious situation that I'm in right now and if I let go or if I literally bent down the wrong way this would open so that's why I was putting it around if I had to wear it like that I would but this top is like it's not it's not it wouldn't do you see what I'm saying it wouldn't work um so I'm gonna wear the skirt as a top cool so I figured out this is this is kind of the vibe I'm going with now this is a pretty little thing set um and im just wearing the skirt as a top ha ha iâ€™m wearing the skirt as the top my friends over there um so this is it this is what I'm gonna wear tomorrow and I think it looks good
