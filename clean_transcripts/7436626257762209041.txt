Do you think of Trump winning the US election? Do you wanna know? I'll go first because I think that you should shut up as a man about this cause I don't think that men really understand the true impact of how it feels. And I don't really think it matters on a global scale because I think that either party is gonna commit genocide. But I do think the most troubling aspect to me is the message it sends to men. The message it sends to men is if you're a rapist, if you're liable and have been held liable in civil court for sexual assault, that you can become one of the most powerful men in the world. We've seen on Twitter the last few days what that has created, which is men saying, your body, my choice. A man saying, I saw a woman crossing the road in front of me while I was driving and I put my foot down on the accelerator because rights, you don't have them anymore as a woman.
