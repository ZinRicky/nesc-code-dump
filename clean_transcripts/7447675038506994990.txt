so I'm getting a lot of comments like this that are like okay but what do we do though and I'm not gonna pretend that I have a step by step plan for how to overthrow the patriarchy all I was saying in that last video is that we're not gonna actually end violence against women by like creating a “female only” whatever the fuck that means um society or like “female separatism” as one of my comments said like this concept of like the only way to protect women is to just completely separate women and men like that doesn't make any sense but I will tell you with 1,000% certainty even though I don't have like a laid out step by step plan for what we in America can do today to overthrow the patriarchy I will tell you that as long as capitalism exists um the patriarchy will also exist like capitalism is the thing that allows men to oppress women the class that the gender binary deems to be man you know and the class that is deemed to be woman um this is something else the gender binary like this whole concept of the gender binary and why like queer liberation and like the liberation of women um these things actually go hand in hand they're one and the same because the sheer concept of like the gender binary the concept of heterosexuality and of being a heterosexual versus a homosexual like these were all things that were created to maintain the hierarchy of man over woman um they were created to maintain this like nuclear family unit this traditional system of marriage um which you know it's an explicitly Marxist belief that the traditional marriage system is like a form of like bourgeois social control anyway sorry I don't wanna ramble and ramble in this video um so I'm gonna put on the screen like a list of like explicitly Marxist feminist like anti capitalist feminist readings and um you guys can leave comments and I can make smaller shorter videos um okay bye
