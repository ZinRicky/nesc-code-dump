some things I will no longer be doing as a woman past her mid twenties No. 1 do a last minute hangout or activity do not expect me to hang out last minute when I will be at home, lounging on the couch, hanging out with my cats, and being in bed by eight PM. I like my daily routine and I will not be changing it. I’ll only ever consider hanging out if you give me a two day notice, scratch that, five day notice and then I'll consider it. otherwise I will not be doing it I'm at home I'm doing my crafts, I'm doing a 30 minute skincare, I'm lounging in a big T-shirt, with my cozy soft socks on. and at eight PM I'll be crawling in bed to read my book while my cat is perched above my head okay, no last minute hangouts will not do it. No. 2 going to parties or after parties you know what they say, what your mama always told you “nothing good happens after midnight” mmm mmm it's a fact I think back about times I've been out past midnight and nothing good happened after just chaos, fights, people getting sick, over drinking, over indulging nothing good is happening if it's not good for me I'm not going. No. 3 Pretending I like you when I don't okay my aura is too precious if I don't like you I'm not gonna pretend I do. If I'm not getting great vibes from you, adios see you never I’m not gonna waste my precious time and energy on you if you're not a good person I enjoy my peace way too much and guess what? I actually like hanging out alone by myself. me, myself and I have a grand time together so no,
