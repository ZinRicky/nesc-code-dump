Have you ever wondered how I get it all done? It might seem like I have it all together from the outside looking in, but I can assure you I'm just a normal wife who's extremely house proud and doesn't like people coming over when it's a mess. Also have four children that like to make things a mess all the time and a husband that's always at work. So it's up to me to get all these things done. It's not easy being a housewife, but it's extremely rewarding. Over the years, I've learnt so many skills that I'm now gonna share with you in my new book, skills for the homemaker.
