this woman is making what I thought was very clearly a joke like it was a joke and I thought that was so obvious and I go into the comment section everyone in the comments is calling her stupid and telling her like babe pickles are pickled cucumber as if she legitimately was not aware of the video that she was like and this is the thing this is my issue when people say that women aren't funny I women are funny women are funny y'all just don't know when women are joking this happens to me all the time like I will be making something that I think is clearly a joke and then everyone in the comments will think I'm serious and I'm like did I not make it clear up and it's like no I did but for some reason we need to like spell out that we're making a joke even when it's impossibly obvious this is something I see online a lot it's like as if the people who are consuming the content believe they're smarter than the creator of the content especially if they're making a fat joke like I as a fat person will say like oh I ate it up ha ha ha ha ha like wink wink nudge nudge ha ha I'm making a fat joke I can do that because I'm fat but then there'll be people in the comments tagging their friends like ha ha she ate it up like and they're making my joke that I just made to their friends as if I'm not aware of the jokes that I just made anyways I have a lot of opinions about humor on the internet specifically and how we only allow certain people to be comics or humorous online as well as the gender divide between comedy and humor but those are topics for another day
