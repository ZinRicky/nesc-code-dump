four boys at a Melbourne private school have been suspended for ranking their female classmates appearances and using proof that spending $30,000 a year on your son's education is not gonna ensure that he doesn't go and üçá somebody so people are always on at me about like why do you talk about sexist language like this doesn't actually matter like all of that type of thing and this is some evidence these year 11 student boys were ranking the girls in their class on a scale a scale from wifey to unwrapable you know how I often talk about the way that um patriarchy and many men like to categorise women into like down towards God's place Madonna or wife or good woman bad woman well um to these guys credit they've actually created more of a spectrum approach from wifey to cutie to objects to get out to un üçá able these boys are 17 and they're not only using the word üçá they're describing women as whether they would enact üçá on them or not and if you think that this doesn't actually lead to actual sexual assault then you are much mistaken this is exactly the type of language that normalises sa as a joke a light hearted thing or something that you're entitled to as a man and in a society where it's normalised or culture where it's normalised it happens for those of you who say oh objectification that doesn't happen they literally are describing women as object there is an Excel spreadsheet with the word object in it and they're literally describing girls I shouldn't say women these are girls as objects get out as an interesting one too I mean it's just like you're not worth it because you're not hot enough I don't want you in my line of vision you don't deserve to be here at school get out of my sight and then the wifey one is interesting it's like this woman is wife material so I hate that term I hate this type of categorisation of women it completely supports and props up üçá culture and it completely undermines consent and respect and this is the type of culture that we're talking about that starts at a really young age that leads to sv becoming normalised accepted tolerated in society by everyone
