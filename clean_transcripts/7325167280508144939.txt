I really do think we're in a moment the summer of Barbie and Beyonce Taylor Swift and this redefining I I think of of girlhood there's a lot of like women dressing for other women almost like we're like in a club and you see me and I see you it's actually like a defining of our own culture as as that's that's different from men I think for a long time mainstream feminism was focused on like we're just as good as men and this feels like we don't want it we don't even you we don't wanna be like men and it's not because we don't like men it's just that we're ourselves as opposed to defining ourselves in opposition to men or even as a response to men
