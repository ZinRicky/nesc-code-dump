good morning I'm in paradise I just have to show you but also a lot of the time when I talk about being able to be a filled and happy mother stay at home mom wife etc does not make you less of a feminist it's because I love my life I love participating in traditionally feminine things I love taking care of my family my family and I love cooking but I've also talked about the fact that it is a much bigger difference being able to choose to stay home and enjoy that role when there are freedoms and other options available to us I enjoy my choice because it's a choice and we've gone into a little bit about how the economics of the gender pay gap and just our economy in general have make it less of a choice that we a lot of us actually admit to would truly be a choice if there was no difference in lifestyle as opposed from working to stay home with your kids if your career could survive having children we lived in a world where it was truly equal we had true Equality having a child would not waylay your independence or financial independence the way it does now
