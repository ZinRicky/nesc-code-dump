so why is a mother's role so crucial for the first three years of their child's development well according to Doctor Erica Commissar the first three years is the most critical time for right brain development the right brain has many roles some of the most important being emotional regulation resilience to stress and can dictate how a child trust people and dictates their future relationships she claims that we have created two to three generations of people unable to form proper attachments and create proper relationship and unknowingly Gen Zers Gen Xers and millennials were the Guinea pigs the Guinea pigs of modern feminism saying that women had to go back to work after they had a baby that millions of us have now because of how our relationship to our mother was in our first three years of development one of the researchers that she interviewed for her book says that women were meant to be the central nervous system of a child within their first three years cause as we all already know now babies and young toddlers are incapable of regulating their emotions so they have to have you as a mom help them regulate you know we all started talking recently about the fourth trimester this is your postpartum state but it also has a lot to do with child development there's a theory that says children were not supposed to be born for at least another nine months that the only reason they are born is because their heads are too large for us to physically hold anymore just like a carry primate just like a koala bear and a gorilla and a panda bear every primates always have their babies attached to them the first year of your child's life should be worn by a mom or close to her at almost all times and this is part of their development just as it would still be developing inside your in utero and without these critical two to three years with your child we have formed three known attachment disorders No. 1 insecure attachment No. 2 reactive attachment disorder or R a d and No. 3 disorganized attachment stay tuned for my next video because I will go through each attachment and how that manifests itself in future relationships when we become adults let me know in the comments if this interests you and I will go into further detail
