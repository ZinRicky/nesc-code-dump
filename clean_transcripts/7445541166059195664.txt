entertaining season might be upon us but I think casual cravings and late night bites are appropriate year round now I've got nine Huntly and Palmers cracker combos that you might wanna save for later for whatever occasion it is that you're catering for For casual cravings on the Baked Sourdough which is made was real sourdough culture by the way you might wanna try Marmite smashed avocado and chilli flakes Caramelised Onion Flatbread lends itself to a simple hummus and tomato medley and you can have the Sprouted Rye cracker bread whole or quartered and I've topped mine with basil pesto and brie now imagine you've got some people over and you want them to think that you're classier than you actually are which is something I do quite often you might offer them some Baked Sourdough with pesto Pear, rocket, Gruyère and balsamic glaze maybe some heirloom tomatoes topped with burrata fresh basil and balsamic glaze again because I really can't fault it maybe a small bite on the Sprouted Rye with some whipped feta caramelised onion honey and fresh thyme might be more your cup of tea and I don't know about you but I find my cracker cravings hit me when I probably should be asleep just trust me on this one but almond butter thin slices of apple and cinnamon is the perfect late night treat maybe you want something a bit sweeter with cream cheese Berry coulis and shaved dark chocolate Or - and this one feels much fancier than it actually is but mascarpone, honey and thyme It’s mostly sweet with a subtle salt and it's quick and delicious now I'm curious if I was gonna offer you any of these which plate are you choosing? cause I think the Huntley & Palmer's range is perfect for every occasion
