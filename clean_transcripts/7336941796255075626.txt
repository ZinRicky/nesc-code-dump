women are not meant to work 9 to 5 jobs I said this before and I'll say it again we shouldn't have to work 9 to 5 jobs women are meant to go to Pilates class, tan by a pool, read a good book, take care of the children, make good food, and be provided for by a man there's no way a woman can be in her feminine energy if she's sitting at a 9 to 5 job where she's unhappy worst part is is there's women out there that are having to fill that masculine role in the office because they have to be they're covering bills they're paying for half a dinner, when a man should be paying for the job every time when did we as a society decide that women should go to a 9 to 5 job to feel some gratification instead of staying at home with the kids. if a woman wants to work part time so she can spend more time with her kids at home she should be able to do that and don't get me wrong if you wanna work a 9 to 5 job
