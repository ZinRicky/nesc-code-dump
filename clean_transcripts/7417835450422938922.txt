Comfort is such a slow death let me share something that will change your life if you simply let it sink in. Every day that you stay in your comfort zone YOU are just getting weaker. The human mind, body was not designed to be in their comfort zone they're designed to grow, adapt and thrive under pressure Comfort is like a slow death it's like a prison and it'll keep you mediocre forever If YOU let it.
