If you're lucky enough to date a girl who does Pilates or yoga, you should marry her. these girls are part of the elite, high value women instead of partying all night or on weekends you know what she's doing? she's doing her skincare and then hopping into bed early because she knows that she has to wake up early just to get to her class pilates and yoga might sound like cute girly workouts but they're definitely not for the weak Theyâ€™re doing hour long full body workouts, doing pulse squats for long durations, core workouts, doing planks to downward dogs, crazy movements and half the time they're not even breaking a sweat but you may not think that these workout classes are hard, but I've seen some of the strongest looking men not be able to keep up in class. these women are flexible and usually in the best shape of their lives Not only that, but they finish these workouts and are in a great mood after getting all these natural endorphins and then they're ready to tackle on the day like it's nothing like they didn't just sweat for an hour and do an intense workout These workouts are helping them relax and lower their stress hormones Improves their energy and overall physical and mental wellness They don't have the energy to go out and party because they're putting in the energy to better themselves and they're more likely to treat you better because they're in a good mood after getting a workout in so she's in great shape she's less stressed out she's generally happier and she'll probably treat you better why would you not marry her?
