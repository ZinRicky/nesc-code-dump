I'm just finally alone for the first time tonight just got the kids to bed so I wanna give you all an update on the family that I'm working with with Operation Olive Branch cause it's somewhat positive my point of contact has been a 22 year old medical student who was trapped in Gaza with his family when he was there to visit and I got an update from him that he was able to get out because he's a student in Egypt but he updated me that the border is now closed his family can't get across so they're still over there in Gaza if you don't know he has been working as a medical volunteer since the war broke out on October 7th but even just in the little bit of time that I have been aware of his gofundme and his family's gofundme we have come up thousands of dollars I think it's actually doubled so as of right now he is still collecting funds on the gofundme for hopefully when the border opens back up they'll be able to get into I guess the queue to get across the border I'm not entirely sure how this works he expressed to me that everybody just wants peace and that's what we're praying for
