We just did the final walkthrough of our new house that this guy bought me for my birthday, and we close next week. We don't own any furniture. Nothing. Like, literally, we own nothing. We don't even own. Actually, I did just get silverware for my birthday, so we have silverware and blankets. We can sleep on the tile. Okay, we have blankets. Yeah, we have some blankets. Some blankets. Some blankets. We don't even own pillows. Like these pillows. I own two. Okay, we don't have cups, bowls, dishes, anything, like, nothing. Game on.
