If your partner does not recharge your battery with love energy and just pure happiness then why are you with them? you hear and see so many women or men complaining about their partner saying like “oh just have to get away from them” “oh I just need a break” “I gotta go take get a drink with the boys or go golfing” or the women saying like oh “I just need a girls night” “I need a vacation with the girls” why?? your partner should be the one that fills your cup up with happiness not any other external factors not any other friends yes friends are important but your cup generally should be filled by your partner If you say you need a break from your partner maybe you need to figure out what's going on and how to fix that problem because that's not a good relationship A good relationship is one that fills your cup up with happiness love appreciation Makes you feel whole Makes you feel full and just a better human because you're around them I'm not saying it's not important to hang out with friends and go to your own thing because that obviously is I'm not taking away from that fact but if you need to do that to recharge or get away from your partner.. then something's wrong there No offense but I get the most satisfaction and pleasure simply by hanging out with my partner Don’t get me wrong yes we need some space occasionally but for the most part it goes without saying to know that when I'm with him He fills my cup up he makes me feel whole and that is what a good relationship should be about Not trying to escape or get away from your partner.
