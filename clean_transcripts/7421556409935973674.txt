Homeschool mom OOTD Today I am going for comfort because I'm about to start my period and I just want to be lazy today so got this two piece black sweatsuit. This is cropped but I'm 5 feet tall so not super cropped on me, but for you tall girlies it would be amazing. Sinched at the bottom. Love it! I have to show you this fleece inside is so so comfy. I just wanna curl up my couch with a good book and just read with the kids all day today. I love this! So comfy! I got from the TikTok shop. I'll link it for you.
