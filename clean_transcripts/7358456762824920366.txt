currently yes they can however I think the debate that we're having is about the um ethics of being able to share all of your views online and the possible consequences of that now I'm going to agree wholeheartedly with people defending this creator saying that she is self aware and she wants to do the work to change and she acknowledges that hating children is not acceptable and she should fix that my issue and my opinion again it's just an opinion and especially coming as somebody who is a parent my opinion is that there are a lot of people who are going to benefit from following her healing journey and doing likewise amounts of self reflection and therapy however the internet is a large anonymous and uncontrollable space so when you say things like I hate kids it's from trauma and I'm working through it there is going to be a percentage of people who that content reaches who stops at the I hate kids and this is why portion of her message and will never go through the required self reflection and therapy to fix that problem they will simply feel validated and vindicated and justified in knowing that there is a reason why they feel this way and of course there's a reason why they feel this way and of course it is linked to trauma and I do think that there is a potential for this type of content or this type of messaging to help those people my issue um is that the potential harm that it could also cause two children as a protected and vulnerable class of people there is no other group of people that someone would come on the internet and say I hate these people but it's because of my own personal traumas and experiences and have that be a well received message accept if it's children that's what I'm trying to discuss I think as a society there is a sphere of acceptability of things for reason in order to protect the collective community and my priority as a member of a community is to protect the most vulnerable person in a situation and in this case it is children I think talking through your hate I think deconstructing it is um valuable and I think it is absolutely something people should do when they recognize those feelings within themselves however because of the anonymity and vast open space and unchecked you don't get to choose who sees your message and how they take it I think that there is a debate to be had about the potential harm that it could also cause not instead of but also and because that harm affects people that I deeply feel protective about I'm going to draw attention to that
