The absolute key to any marriage is having or knowing a basic understanding of your spouse's interest or hobbies in order to have a meaningful conversation with them I don't watch baseball I genuinely know nothing about the sport I'm learning Iâ€™ve learned that a sack fly is when the batter hits it really far in order to have the third base score home run I know enough about this sport to know his favorite team when to ask how they're doing how they're playing and when they are playing He absolutely lights up whenever I ask him and honestly that is the key to any marriage!
