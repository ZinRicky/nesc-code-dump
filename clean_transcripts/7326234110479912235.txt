do you remember a while back there is that woman who sent her husband to the store because she wanted to make pumpkin bars and he was talking about well there was no pumpkin on the list so I didn't get any pumpkin because you know I just how dare she not remember to put pumpkin on the list I'll show her I just have my own real life version of this I am making a red wine braised beef stew um it's gonna be kind of like a beef bouignon slash uh pot roast I don't really know the direction I'm going but it's gonna be delicious and I needed a couple ingredients and I sent my husband to the grocery store and I told him to get me a turnip and he called me just now because he goes okay so I looked they don't have turnips they don't have parsnips but I did find you a rutabaga is there any way you might want a rutabaga and I said no I don't want a rutabaga it's a completely different flavor profile and he was like I didn't think so but I wanted to call to check and that my friends is somebody who actually gives a shit to perform their task not to mention you went to the grocery store in like a 30 degree weather with the baby simply because he wanted me to have all the ingredients I needed so they exist
