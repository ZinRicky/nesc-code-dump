it's Sunday and you know what that means time to plan another week of homeschooling if you've been following along you know last week we did Shark Week and this week is just a typical homeschooling for us you might be thinking girl it is summer why the heck are you still homeschooling it's because we homeschool year round we live in South Florida and it is hecka hot here in the summer we spend a lot more time indoors so it just makes sense that we homeschool a little bit more in the summer don't feel too bad for my kids because we do take a lot of time off in the winter typically our summer learning is a lot of review from the previous year and filling in any gaps between grade level curriculums we're at that awkward point in the summer where we are finished with everything from last year but I don't wanna start the next grade level curriculum focusing on a lot of math and reading fluency this week we're gonna be playing a lot of math games just practicing addition subtraction math facts over and over again Pinterest is my best friend because I just cannot come up with all of these activities by myself in college my professors used to always say don't reinvent the wheel meaning if something was already done or creative for you don't waste your time creating yourself I can get free ideas or resources online I am definitely doing that's also how I make homeschooling affordable because homeschooling can be incredibly expensive and we live on one income it is a financial sacrifice but one that we would choose again and again because this has been the best thing that we've ever done for our family
