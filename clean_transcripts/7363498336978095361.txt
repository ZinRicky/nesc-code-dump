in their own victimisation educated and empathetic is a part of the problem and not a part of the solution and motive and impact than when it's perpetrated by men which I'm not because I'm happily partnered with um and dominance and control in the relationship over the other person but rest assured I would not be interested in dating um bad women etcetera I'd be looking for someone who was informed Lucky her um and if they're gonna bring women into the household who are problems for you where one person tries to assert power domestic violence is a manifestation of power and control rather than that's not me that's just the facts no one is questioning that in confronting the systemic issues that perpetuate violence against all genders someone else's son Lucky women can be perpetrators maybe instead of worrying who our sons are dating when they do though usually when women um statistically women are more likely to be victims than perpetrators perpetrate domestic violence this is well established by experts anyone who's been taught to play a role in making women question the role we should be focusing on teaching our sons respect and consent if I was looking for a partner pre existing powerdynamics in society between the genders it often manifest quite differently because of existing rather than continue to be a part of the problem and understood that holding individuals accountable for a systemic problem and educating them properly women can undo commit acts of domestic violence it's really crucial when talking about women's role in domestic violence imply that victims have a role in causing the domestic violence against them it's in the context of defence or retaliation from a long term pattern of abuse that we don't frame things in a way that this differs are quite a lot in context that way our sons can be a part of the solution thank you so much for your concern
