when people ask me to hang out over the weekend in theory I have nothing going on but then I think to myself how will I be able to do my daily minimum seven hours of doing nothing being a sloth both Saturday and Sunday are very important to me I also have to hang out with my cats and eat my grilled dinners so no I don't really have time for you, I'm sorry
