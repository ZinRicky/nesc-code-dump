so I've been thinking about the 4B movement sorry my cat is here right by my face um I'm thinking about the 4B movement and how our generation um or maybe this is just like America in general and like our anti intellectualism um we are like obsessed with hard and fast rules to things which I think is a symptom of our lack of critical thinking skills in America and the fact that like we are just very much taught that you have to just do what someone else tells you I feel like the left really suffers from this even though it is a side effect of like growing up in a right wing authoritarian country so with the 4B movement specifically and this is far from the only place where this shows up because I think that it popped up with election discourse a lot but with the 4B movement it's just interesting that feminists have been saying for years and years now that like women need to decenter men you need to like you know disengage from like all the heterosexual patriarchal like propaganda like all of this and then obviously it didn't catch on too much I mean there has been an increase in like women being independent from men um but now like everyone's talking about the 4B movement and like there are a lot of criticisms completely valid criticisms coming of it like I think if we actually could get a considerable percentage of women in America on board with having a strict boycott of not dating not having sex with men not getting married not having children like I think that would be we would see results but so many women are going to keep dating and keep sleeping with men and they're going to like say like oh like I stand in solidarity with the feminists and the 4B movement but like I found a good one like my man is the exception and there are good men in the world might be controversial to to hear from someone who is a very far left like feminist but I don't believe that men are 100% inherently evil um I think that actually like kind of feeds into bio essentialism a little bit though that might be a TikTok for another time is that why they say the 4B movement in Korea is terfy I actually had no idea why people say that it's like full of terfs but is that it is it because of the bio essentialism of it anyway how come that when we say decenter men it's not very effective but then you talk about the 4B movement just launching a very strict boycott of all things heterosexual and patriarchal then all of a sudden people are really interested
