okay we gotta sit down for this one I'm a mom of three kids please excuse my appearance I just got home from the gym I always knew I wanted to be a mom but I talk a lot on here about my support of the child free people okay because this is not for everyone and I was scrolling the little ticky tacky as you do and I came across this video and oh my god you have to see this because honestly watch that it's a stitch mostly for a woman with all due respect enjoy your selfish self centered self serving life and enjoy always taking the easy way out and doing everything the easy way never doing anything difficult or meaningful or rewarding or anything worthwhile and enjoy dying alone the hardest things in life will always be the most worthwhile so if you're that weak it's probably better that you don't have kids and by the way there are a lot better countries living in Mexico Mexico's gross and dirty yuck and it's a good thing you're smoking hot but you're gonna get old that too okay so all the offensive things in one video right like and just sprinkle a little racism in there too xenophobia why not that was one of the most horrific takes from actual parents I've ever seen and I'm a parent but wait it gets better this is the same guy but I just can't believe that a few like several years ago I was on the fence whether I wanted kids or not or I thought well they were never gonna want kids but like I married you and you want kids so I guess I'll agree to have kids but it's gonna be tough it's a lot of work whatever literal same words to me I just would never have kids because because then your life's not your own anymore and you're all about your kids you're not about you you can't do what you want when you want you know kids it's a it's a big commitment it's a lot of work like she said it's worth it and like you know even the the studies in the stats about like parents with kids are like they have more problems they're more prone to divorce they're more likely to be depressed and I just thought like well you know the irony the data has spoken we probably shouldn't have kids I just can't believe now that we have her and she's like two and a half years old that I ever would have thought that I wouldn't have wanted a kid because huh she's amazing yeah awesome and she's she's beautiful and she's and she's I'm so glad you love your own child she's she's out there she has a ton of energy she's a lot she's super hard to keep up with she's super hard to like you know to manage and to stay on top of she doesn't sleep through the night she gets in bed with us she keeps us awake but like but she is my favourite thing in the entire world that's amazing she's she's kind for you and she's sweet and she's brilliant and she's got this amazing personality and like and she's mine and I see like myself in her in the things that she likes and says and does in her yeah it's great being a parent is great so anyone who has kids can relate to the second part of the video but it blows my fucking mind that that guy had all the same arguments and self thoughts about not having children and then goes on to shame a woman for having those same thoughts and coming to a different conclusion for her life and her happiness how fucking gross I don't say this a lot but shame on you shame on you
