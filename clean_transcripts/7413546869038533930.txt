don't think you have to say brunette if you wanna try being blonde simply because like of my personal opinions about blonde as it pertains to the white beauty standard because I found blonde okay even if you can have criticisms or have like observances about the beauty standard doesn't mean that you also don't like adhere to them because they are the standard practice of the day and I just like changing my hair color cause it's fun but you will notice or at least like I've noticed as somebody who's changed my hair color a lot um and other people can corroborate in the comments if you've had a similar experience you get more male attention with blonde hair you just do so that's some food for thought
