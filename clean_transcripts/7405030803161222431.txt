I'm on team wash your chicken before cooking. Although many feel you should not wash your chicken, I'm starting with a fully pasture raised chicken from my parents farm that was slaughtered at 3 months of age right there on the farm in a healthy farm environment. After washing and preparing the poultry, I clean my work surfaces tools in the surrounding area with branch basics. A superior non toxic cleaning product that's not only free of harmful chemicals, it's also cheaper. Well, it can't get any healthier than this bird, but still, I feel more comfortable washing my chicken. I prefer to start with a clean slate, free of debris, filament, or whatever may be left over on the meat from the slaughtering and processing. I always wash my meats and my fish too. I also rinse my legumes, rice and nuts before cooking. And if you're wondering, I get 64 laundry loads plus 14 bottles of home and kitchen cleaning products out of one bottle of Branch Basics concentrate. Alright. And this is peach chicken. Insane, I tell you.
