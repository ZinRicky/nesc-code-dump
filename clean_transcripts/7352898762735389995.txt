Most people forget this when they're meeting new people. This one thing will help you make friends, and build strong connections with other people. When people first meet other people and they're trying to have a conversation. People usually do two things when somebody tells you something about themselves, someone is either gonna A) relate it back to them or B) ask a question about what they just told you. Most people think that relating things is a good thing, but you just related it back to yourself. When you want to get to know people, that's not what you wanna do. You wanna talk about them. Most people love talking about themself, People love to hear their name, they love to brag. If you let them do this, then they will feel special. So next time someone is trying to share something about themself, instead of relating it back to you. What you should do is ask them questions. for example someone tells you they just worked out this morning they feel really good. Instead of relating it back to you and saying, Oh I did too. What you should do is ask them, What did you work out? What did you do? Did you have fun? Was it a good workout? Stop relating everything back to you if you want to really get to know people and build strong connections because people love to talk about themselves. It’s the easiest way, when you meet someone go up to them ask them questions and listen. Don't automatically reply with something about yourself I understand that this can be challenging because everybody wants to relate to you, but that's not how you’re going to make strong connections So the next time you're trying to make a friend, or you're talking to a new acquaintance. Consider this. Ask them questions.
