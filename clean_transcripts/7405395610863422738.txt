about 2 days a month I don't wanna be seen or heard cause I would rather be curled up in the foetal position and today is one of them Aunt Flo sure knows how to schedule her visits cause tomorrow is my birthday well technically it's today cause I filmed this yesterday but all I wanted for my birthday was a clean fkn house doesn't feel like much to ask but have you ever cleaned up before a cleaner comes? cause I hear that's a thing and I've just spent a good two hours running around my house doing a good preliminary clean and now I - the cleaner - have arrived for the deep clean but if you know me and you follow me you know that I subscribe to the idea that birthdays are your own personal New Year and I also believe that a New Year begins when you change the energy in your home so it's gotta be done the only way I know how to do that is to deep clean the shit out of everything I see so I'm starting by steam cleaning my flooring but it's not actually starting cause I've already vacuumed everything I could find and also I'm interchangeably using my Sweepy Moppy Thingy which sweeps and mops as the name would suggest But essentially I just wanted to wake up on my 396 month old birthday and float around the fkn cleanest house I could find which is tricky when I mid renovation and saying as I had my steam cleaner out it would be rude not to do my bathroom I started the way that I always do which is by emptying all the products out and pre treating the shower with my mould killer and while that works it's magic I get stuck into the sink and the toilet when you have 3 boys in the house all sharing the same facilities as not for the faint of heart and if I'm gonna be totally honest my main motivation behind wanting to deep clean the shower was later I would like to have an everything shower and also recently I purchased this oscillating head for my steam cleaner so it rotates and steams at the same time and if that doesn't make you excited then we are not the same anyway I feel like the night before your birthday is the perfect excuse to give yourself a spa day when I say everything shower I mean literally everything I'm talking double hair wash hair mask wax shave exfoliation tan facial lash and brow tint you know just everything I need to look presentable and this thought was the light at the end of the tunnel for me but funny story by the time I got the kids through the shower and into bed I hopped in the shower myself there was no hot water left so there was no birthday glow up for me but at least I hopped into bed with fresh sheets anyway I did clean my bedroom and then I folded a whole laundromats worth of washing which is one of the most satisfying feelings and I don't care to argue about that then I was finally ready to open my birthday present from the same time tomorrow they very kindly included me in their PR sendout so that I could have the perfect night in and honestly my dining table set up has been driving me nuts lately so having some new things to dress it with made my whole day They sent a tablecloth placemats napkins and the cutest fkn napkin rings I've ever seen ever now my table is very demure very cutesy Anyway so spoiler alert when I woke up this morning my house didn't quite look like this but the residual energy of clean was there and for me that's self care and now all I have to do is finish the mimosa I'm drinking and celebrate being 33
