my alma mater Indiana University is one of the universities in America that responded to its liberation zone for G on campus by putting snipers on the roof of a school building this is the Indiana Memorial Union um overlooking Dunn Meadow where the liberation zone is currently happening here's another photo that my friend posted on their Instagram of a sniper on the roof of the IMU it's day three of the encampment at Indiana University but on day one the state police were present and arrested 33 people including faculty members and the students who were arrested were banned from campus for a year so what you can do to help the Indiana University liberation zone for G is call the office of the president of Indiana University and demand amnesty for the protesters and express support for the encampment again these students who were arrested were arbitrarily banned from campus for one year without going through the proper procedure via the office of Student Conduct this simply cannot stand and you need to make your voices heard by calling this number at the office of the president and Indiana University do not let this country get away with putting snipers on the roofs of public universities
