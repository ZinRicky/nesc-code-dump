These just came in the mail, and I'm very excited to use them because they are replacements for the O cedar spin mop mop heads, which, if you know, and if you have, you know, they're very expensive, but I just got a pack of three of these for, like, the price of one. They look and they feel the same exact way as the O cedar ones, so get them while you can.
