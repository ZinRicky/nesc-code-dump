there are so many comments like this one on my video from last night that are like so true so relatable I personally relate to that so much but I really wanna drive it home that it's not just men's like insecurities fears it's not just their mental health issues that cause them to mistreat women it is the fact that we live in a patriarchy we live in a society we live in a patriarchal society where men get away with shit I mentioned in my video that like I've been watching Bridgerton and I wish that dudes still had to duel whenever they were being dishonest like if a dude was like lying cheating gaslighting manipulating I wish that like one of their homies would just hit them up and be like bro I heard you were not being a gentleman meet me at dawn that just does not happen there's no accountability there's no like checking of like a man's behavior and that's why we're facing this like dating like catastrophe right now like more and more women are choosing to be single more and more women are choosing themselves men like are increasingly lonely and then they turn to like 4chan right wing incel shit um but again I wanna go back to the point of it's not men's loneliness their insecurity their fear their mental health issues that cause them to treat women the way that they treat them
