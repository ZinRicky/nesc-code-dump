not to be dramatic but I feel like this homemade raspberry and hazelnut chocolate has just drastically improved my life I found it in Nourish, the Fit Womanâ€™s Cookbook by Lorna Jane Clarkson yes that Lorna Jane who's active where I thrash every day of the week and this cookbook is fantastic with over 150 well balanced recipes ranging from breakfast to dinner snacks and treats and today I was really craving something sweet so we're gonna quickly make this chocolate I started by roughly chopping a quarter of a cup of raw hazelnuts and popping that on a lined baking tray alongside a third of a cup of flaked cocoanut that goes into the oven at 170 for about three minutes while I get started on my chocolate for the base I took a cup of organic cacao butter and chop that finely before placing that in a double boiler on my stove and stirring until it had melted then I took that off the heat and sifted in half a cup of cacao powder alongside a third of a cup of raw honey or you can use pure maple syrup I didn't have any maple syrup on hand today so I'm going with a high quality manuka honey give that a good mix and add in a pinch or two of fine Himalayan pink salt and that's literally the hard part done I poured the mixture into a lined cake tin and then I topped it with my toasted hazelnuts and coconut and then finish it all off with some fresh or frozen berries pop that in the freezer to sit for about half an hour and you'll be left with a gorgeous but good for you sweet treat once it's fully set I break it up into kinda chunks and then store those in an airtight container in the freezer I'm loving the ethos of this cookbook it's very mindful and this recipe was delicious
