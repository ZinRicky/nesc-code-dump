did you know you don't have to teach every subject everyday if you don't want to and there are different schedule types that could be a better fit for your family two of the most popular are loop scheduling and block scheduling loop scheduling is when you have a list of subjects you wanna teach and you loop through them as you have time and block scheduling is teaching subjects on specific days I go more in depth with these on my blog we are the hollies.com so if you wanna learn more about them and see how they could fit your home school head over there this year I decided to try out block schedule I wanted to be able to put more emphasis on each subject and have time to do extra practice and go deeper I felt like when we were trying to fit all the subjects into one day we could only do surface level for everything my kids are still young and have short attention spans so every time we switch subjects it was like a battle to get them to focus again and when I asked them what we Learned that day they would always say I don't know for us it was just too much going on at one time so I switched to block schedule on Mondays and Thursdays we would do reading geography and Bible on Tuesdays and Fridays we do math science and Bible and on Wednesdays is their co op day and we do Wonder Bucket I wanted to split up math and reading specifically because it requires most of their attention and those are the subjects I felt like we needed extra practice reach mastery I've noticed that my kids are picking up on concepts so much faster with this type of schedule and I truly believe it's because we have more time to spend on our course subjects each day and it feels like less of a burden to me I don't have as much to teach and plan for each day and our days just feel so much more productive
