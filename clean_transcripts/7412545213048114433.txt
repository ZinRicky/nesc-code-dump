if you're like me and you find yourself craving some tangy juicy sweet and crunchy Chinese lemon chicken then this recipe will knock your fkn socks off for my dry ingredients I mixed together plain flour cornflour salt and pepper and then I made an egg wash by beating an egg which really is as simple as it sounds then I sliced about three chicken breasts up into cube shapes before popping them through my egg wash and dipping them into the flour and once you're all evenly coated in the egg and flour mix I shallow fry them in some really hot oil and I find the trick to getting the perfect fry is to cook them in smaller batches and keep them moving until they're golden and crunchy on the outside and cooked and tender in the middle I cooked all the chicken in three batches before setting it aside and getting started on my lemon chicken sauce combine lemon juice soy sauce rice wine vinegar water sugar alongside a cornflour slurry made from mixing 2 parts boiling water with 1 part cornflour I cooked it down to let it thicken up before adding back in my fried chicken and I let all those flavours marry together over the heat for about a minute and then it was time to plate up and I just went really simple with this and served it with some plain white rice some sauteed wok fried veggies sesame seeds and coriander even the kids ate it without complaint and that's how I know it's good
