this is gonna ruffle a few feathers but with the school year about to start I feel like it needs to be said as a parent your child's education is your responsibility now I'm not saying that every parent needs to homeschool but it is your job to make sure that your kids are getting a good education it's your job to make sure they have all the school supplies and all the materials they need to be successful throughout the school it's your job to get them help if they are starting to fall behind it is your job to communicate with their teachers to make sure they're being successful in the class it is your job to prioritize their education and make sure extracurricular activities aren't getting in the way of their studying in their home it is your job to advocate for your kids and make sure their needs are being met you're not gonna do is blame the teacher if your child is falling behind or acting up in class you're going to be open to the criticism and partner with your teacher to make sure your child is getting the best educate and remember that teacher is also responsible for 20 30 40 or more other kids they are doing the best they can under those circumstances and they need you as an ally not a critic so before you point fingers at the teacher or school this year remember you are responsible for your child's education
