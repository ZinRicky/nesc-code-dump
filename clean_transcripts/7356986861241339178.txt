I just got to the Wits Creator Summit here in Salt Lake City, Utah. I just took off all my makeup, done comfy outfit, hung out for a little bit. Now I'm gonna get ready to go meet my girls, Andrea and Juju, for dinner. So let's get ready. Okay. That was super anticlimactic, because I already did most of my makeup, and I'm almost dressed, but I can't quite get myself in. There we go. Okay. But we can do hair. So I'm actually here in Salt Lake for what's called the women in Travel Summit. It is a travel influencer conference. And I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say, Lisa, you're not actually a travel influencer. And to that, I say, says who? Technically, I do a lot of lifestyle stuff, and since we've been homeschooling, I really am doing a lot more travel content just because it kind of lines up with what we're doing in our life. So I decided to come here because a worst case scenario, I get a couple nights away from the kids and hotel room in a bed by myself, um, with two of my girlfriends from home. Or best case scenario, make some connections and get some tips and have a lot of fun, and it gets to do more travel content for y'all.
