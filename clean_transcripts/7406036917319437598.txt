Yeah, this set of brushes from the TikTok shop is a whole. It's like 40. It's a whole 40 piece set. Not only the brushes, it comes with a ton of brushes, the makeup sponges, these, like, powder pressing things and. And it comes with a bunch. I still haven't even used all of them. Things to wash your face, things to clean the brushes. This thing is a huge. And they're nice brushes. They're synthetic, really nice brushes. They really work well. I just have a lot of options now when I'm doing my makeup, and I love it. It's linked here in the TikTok shop. It is a bajillion brushes, all the different shapes, sizes, anything you could want. And sponges and powder applicators. Like, I feel like a professional MUA and shit.
