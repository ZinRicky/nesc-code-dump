now why do married women say that they would never get married to a man again or date men again if they've already done the process they've already dated they've already married they're with a man and I can only speak from my own experience but it is because of my experience you see in this argument about um in cells and the difference in what's going on between men and women in the dating world right now is I feel like men think other women are making them hate men but in reality nothing turns women away from wanting to engage with men more than their own personal experiences with men take me for example I was a very active dater I don't think I had a very long term relationship until I met my husband I had boyfriends for usually about a year to two years and then would move on but I was a serial dater I always had a boyfriend I like being a partnership and out of all the boyfriends I can tell you that there is only one other man that I dated other than my current husband who I would consider like a good man good partner good relationship I dated far more terrible men than I dated good ones and not all terrible men are like boogeyman monsters bad experiences can come in many different varieties although I did date a guy who did put me in the emergency room I also had a good male friend who just got sick of being in the friend zone and um forced himself on me at some point I have dated cheaters and liars narcissist gaslighters manipulators and even that one other really nice guy boyfriend planned out our entire life without my input which freaked me out which is why we broke up may have treated me well but didn't respect me enough to include me in our life plans so when I say that if something were ever to happen to my husband that I would never date men again it is not because I don't want a good relationship with a man it's just that I don't have the energy time or desire to end up in a bad one and the bad ones are more likely statistically
