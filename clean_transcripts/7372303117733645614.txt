they are coming for birth control here's what you need to know let's start with the fact that just two days ago the Republican nominee for president stated that access to birth control should be left up to the states support any restrictions on a person's right to contraception we're looking at that and I'm gonna have a policy on that very shortly well that suggests that you may wanna support some restrictions like a morning after pill or something we are we are also you know things really do have a lot to do with the states and some states are gonna have different policies than others he followed that up by screaming online that he would never advocate imposing restrictions on birth control which if that's true why don't you answer that then and also this leaves it open for him to say I didn't advocate for birth control restrictions I just left it up to the states to do the dirty work for me and then he screams that I don't support a ban on birth control and neither will the Republican Party don't be fooled they'll do the same thing that they did with abortion they won't necessarily start with an outright ban they'll start with a bunch of common sense restrictions and start piling on the restrictions to a point where it becomes practically impossible to actually obtain one not just Trump Republicans including the speaker of the House Mike Johnson have been spreading propaganda over and over again that Plan B is an abortifation as a way to try to ban that listen to what the Heritage Foundation one of the most influential conservative think tanks has to say about birth control seems to be that a good place to start would be a feminist movement against the film and for rewilding sex returning for dangerous sex returning the intimacy and unreading consquentiality sex now on Sears with the Alliance Defending Freedom says that he hopes that one day Americans will say that the birth control pill was a mistake control like really screws up female brains by the way to control their moods their period it is it is awful it's terrible um and it creates very angry and bitter young ladies and young women I've talked about how in the mifapristone litigation conservatives are trying to revive the Comstock Act which is from the 1800s and made it a federal offense to male birth control and abortifications let's not forget that Justice Thomas explicitly called for the Supreme Court to revisit Griswold which provided constitutional protections for birth control in the last 24 hours Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer introduced a Bill that would provide federal protections for contraceptions and I will report follow up with you on how many Republicans sign this Bill Mark my words they will come after birth control in the same way that they did abortions they will just start chipping away at it with restrictions after restrictions they will continue spreading propaganda that it's dangerous for women that it makes us crazy and that it's actually an abortion and they'll try to ban it that way they'll start calling it a states issue which is just another way of saying that we are fine with states imposing restrictions on it and then they'll gaslight you online and say that they're not against restrictions on birth control because they don't want the political backlash over what they literally just said I'm the feminist lawyer I'm a litigator with a background and reproductive race let me know if you have any questions or anything I can help with
