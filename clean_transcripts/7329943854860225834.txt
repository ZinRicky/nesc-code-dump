I haven't done an outfit of the day in what feels like a million years, so here's the outfit of the day. Please don't mind my bins. I'm planning a ski trip, and we have everybody stuff out. Um, but today I'm doing very bright. It's still gonna be pretty cold, so I'll probably wear an overcoat. Um, I just got this turquoise sweater, this cute little red skirt, and the shoes are from Kate Spade. For being colorful and staying warm.
