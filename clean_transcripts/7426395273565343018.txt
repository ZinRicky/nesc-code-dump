I heard something today that I just cannot stop thinking about and somebody said that I'm a chronic oversharer because I think I am better taken with context and I have never related to anything more in my life I am a chronic oversharer if you follow me on here you know and I think it's because my biggest fear is someone not understanding like exactly what they're getting with me and somehow misaligning how they see me as a person so I leave almost every social interaction being like that was a lot I will say it does make it very easy to have a relationship with me cause you're gonna love me or you're gonna hate me but you're gonna know who I am after the first conversation
