okay it's been said a million times but I feel the need to reiterate because I just saw a video of a girl you know in the age of trad wifery okay this video is about trad wives um or even just women who are like staying home and cooking and cleaning is so much better than being a corporate baddie um I saw a woman who said don't tell the feminists but you know I would rather cook and clean and then people are replying and stitching and saying okay but feminism is about choosing like you get to choose whether or not you wanna be a stay at home mom or wife or girlfriend or whatever but or like being a corporate baddie and I'm not stitching or tagging cause I'm truly not trying to call anyone out I just need to put it out there that you know we've already been through this whole notion of choice feminism and how feminism is not about women just doing whatever they want and people just supporting whatever it is that an individual woman wants feminism is about the liberation of the masses from patriarchal oppression and there are a lot of women and we see it with the trad wives there are a lot of women who do not make choices that align with feminism and I need to just write a substack essay about this because like tradwife culture or like women who are toying with the idea of just being stay at home girlfriends or wives or whatever like that's a direct consequence of capitalism that's a direct consequence of like okay the whole corporate baddie like 9 to 5 life you know that you know feminism has tried to sell us it's not all sex and the city it's not all thirty flirty and thriving like this is not fun working sucks and yeah jobs suck but that's why we need to become Marxist feminists in the year 2024 and then comes the whole question of like choice and seriously I'm gonna write an essay about this because it's too much to get into on TikTok but like when you are choosing between the lesser of two evils like between being a slave to capitalism versus being a slave to your husband like is that actually like even a choice like that's the great tragedy of choice feminism is that you're choosing between the lesser two evils you're choosing you know you're picking your poison so is that really a choice like are we actually even making these choices that you're saying that we're making because you know in a truly egalitarian feminist society the choices that women you know non men like everyone who is oppressed by patriarchy like these choices that we're making um they should be completely autonomous they should not be made under coercion they should not be made under threat of like you know either be a corporate baddie or you'll go homeless or you know either be a stay at home wife and mother or go homeless and like here's the disclaimer if you have a partner regardless of their gender if you have a partner that you feel safe and comfortable being financially and materially dependent upon like if you are you know the person who keeps house and they're the person who goes to their 9 to 5 like great genuinely good for you but in an ideal world nobody would ever be financially and materially dependent upon like another individual their society would just take care of them regardless of what they do regardless of whether they work outside the home or within it so anyway
