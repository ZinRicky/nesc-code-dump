honestly all the offers to buy my daughter a cup are so outrageously generous the links that people are going to to try to find me to say hey can I please give your daughter this cup that I've had blah blah blah um you know what I would love if you guys did with those cups because it is an amazing cup for a child like my daughter like the way she can hold it and it's so funny that everybody knew what fucking cup I was talking about that I cried when I found it because of how perfectly I felt it was gonna meet her needs if you have one that you're not using could you donate it to your local down syndrome association maybe you didn't know that was a thing but there is usually in your area thank goodness my daughter I always say we hit the Jackpot of disabilities because it's not invisible when people see her they know she has it um a lot of people know about it cause it's been so normalized in the media um and you know she gets a lot of kindness in the world and so and this is just another outpouring of the kindness that we've always received for the most part so while this is a shitty thing that happened to us we can turn it into something beautiful so if you have one of those cups and you really wanna give it to my daughter you could just donate it to your local Down Syndrome Down Syndrome Association and just say hey this this lady on TikTok sent me because I I there are families that could use them and so I don't want your beauty the beauty in your heart and the generosity to go to go wasted so it's I'm just so um my heart is just so filled with all the the the wonderfulness coming our way so thank you so much
