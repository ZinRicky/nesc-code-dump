nothing worse than being a woman in this business I sometimes wish I was African American you know okay so in feminist scholarship there's this idea that oppressions are not ranked they're linked which is the idea that you can't really say that like sexism is worse than racism or racism is worse than sexism that they're all connected many black feminist scholars will say that their blackness right their experience of racism is actually the the the hardest part of their experience more than their womenness this because they they don't just experience racism they experience a modified more pernicious uh version of racism which is modified by the sexism that they experience this comment doesn't just omit the you know existence of black women um it also makes Assumption that somehow the experience of black women is easier than the experience of white women which is well documentedly not true what sort of that said is that she wants to be an African American man which is unfortunately how a lot of white women come into feminism wanna be men they want power not freedom want an individual emancipation and not a collective one
