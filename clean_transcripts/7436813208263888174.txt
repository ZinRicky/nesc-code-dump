contrary to what the left thinks two things can be true at the same time I can find value in my role as a stay at home mom and still support women who work outside of the home and want something different than I do I can believe in a traditional marriage and still support your right to marry whoever you want to or stay single I don't care I can support women's rights and be pro life because those lives matter too I can want safe spaces for our women and girls and still want transgender people to feel safe too cause how I have chosen to live my life is not a personal attack on you and how you have chosen to live your life is not an attack on me but what is an attack on me is when you come to my comment section and spew hate based on a preconceived notion you have about me and what the media says I believe I think it's time we get our head out of our asses and stop believing everything we see on social media
