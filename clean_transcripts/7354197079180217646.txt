Hey, check out this busy board that I found on TikTok Shop. You know, when Killian is breastfeeding, he's always, like, grabbing everything and twiddling. This has been keeping him distracted while I'm feeding him. He's super fascinated by the lights and buttons. It's available on my TikTok shop. I added it to my link right here. Just click on the orange link below.
