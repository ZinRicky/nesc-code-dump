when are the nice guys on this app gonna actually turn out to be nice guys and no offense to the nice guys that I follow because I assume you are good people but over and over and over these men on this app who make like understanding women and combating patriarchy and misogyny part of their platform and create these huge followings of women turn out to be a disappointment and those of you who are on this app who are doing that work and also have similar platforms you should be holding these men accountable publicly because that's the biggest problem that's the biggest way a man can be an ally to a woman is checking other men it's not reading the books and understanding us and being nice to us it's helping protect women against men who pray on women and I'm not talking about one specific creator but this shit just keeps happening and I'm so sick of it and I'm so disappointed
