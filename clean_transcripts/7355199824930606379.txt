My Roman Empire will always be how my children react to the very real scenarios of parenting that I was raised with so I'm a cycle breaker parent I am re parenting myself I am doing the healing journey I am parenting my children in a respectful and conscious way very differently than how I was raised very differently than how I think a lot of millennial parents were raised so when my children my older children were 9 and 7 find out some of the ways that I was parented their mind is blown cause we have lots of conversations about how we handle our big feelings how we handle our emotions and I was having one of these conversations recently with my daughter and I said that I had to learn all of these skills as an adult which is why I'm teaching them now as children because it'll just be a lot easier so my daughter is brilliant and she has tons of questions she's like okay well if you were not taught how to like handle your emotions well what happened to you when you had big emotions and she's 9 she's heard a little bit about it but I told her about having to stand in the corner told her about time out and I told her that I had soap or chili peppers part of my tongue if I talked back or used a bad word the jaw dropped and she goes why would they do that and I had to explain to her it was cause they wanted me to hurt they wanted to cause me suffering as a punishment and she made this face and then said I'm really glad you guys aren't doing that to us the cycle is breaking
