demands broadly start with disclosure and divestment as of right now students do not have access to where their money is going when they pay tuition fees to this university so crucially our first demand is full disclosure of financial investments crucially about Israel right well we want to know where all of the money is going we think that that's key for students to know where their money is going whether it's about Israel or not but then with this knowledge we would like to pursue full divestment from two things first from all arms manufacturing companies whether it's the current genocide in Gaza or other armed conflict around the world our university should not be investing in that this is a situation where we should be learning and contributing to education in a safe community not to international conflict and secondly we request and demand that the university divest from all holdings and any entities that sponsor or complicit in Israeli occupation apartheid in the current genocide in Gaza additionally we have boycott demands key of which is the demand to stop banking with Barclays which the university currently does Barclays has been complicit in the architecture of Israeli apartheid and so that's a key demand from the boycott divestment and sanctions global movement and our last demand is that the university commits to a Palestinian LED rebuilding of the Gazan higher education sector okay so how much link up have you had with the the movement in the United States and with other student protests in the UK yeah so crucially I mean the US movement set off a global chain of reaction and we're so excited to be a part of that and thankful to the US encampments for what they began we've had a lot of support from them in terms of logistics general conradship giving us tips and tricks but really the UK movement um has also Learned a lot from them in terms of how our goals are so similar although the US and the UK have different contexts the UK government is similarly complicit in Israeli war crimes and so to our institutions of higher education so we Learned a lot from them in terms of our demands how to engage with our governments and how to mobilize students in the UK we also have really collaborated with other universities Oxford is so proud to be launching in tandem with Cambridge this is the first time in like social movement history that Oxford and Cambridge have launched a campaign on the same day
