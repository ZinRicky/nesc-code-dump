today was day two of Shark Week and these are the activities my kids did they started the morning making these deep sea fishing boats out of our Costco boxes for math they did these number puzzles where they matched two digit numbers to the Thames Cubes they did feed the shark again to get some extra practice with those words when I watched the video back from yesterday I noticed Maverick only spell the words and never read them so today I made sure that he read each word and yes they did pretty much all of their school work from their boats today it is an easy way to bring some joy into their day and I just don't care where they do their school work and they pretended to go scuba diving for sharks teeth then this beach is known as Sharks Tooth Capital of the world and it's one of our favorite beaches so we've collected these over a lot of trips we used a shark guide to figure out who the teeth may have belonged to I have a few of these pocket guides for different things in our area like birds wildlife fish seashells ton of things and they are one of my most used resources they're great for in home investigations like this but I love to take them with us we also did a little shark anatomy study and I am so impressed with how much my kids know about sharks we ended the day with a little report all about hammerhead sharks as you can see my kids are using this pilot erasable pens I talked about last week they love being able to write in colour and I love that they can erase their mistakes and that's a wrap on Shark Week day 2 come back tomorrow
