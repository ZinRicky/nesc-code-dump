Arabella and Olympia wrote a list of recipes I should make with all the peaches from our tree, so I chose the easiest one to make Peach Popsicles. I'm using three cups of my frozen ripe peaches combined with a homemade yogurt, cream cheese straight from the farm, 100% pasture raised raw dairy, and then a spoonful of raw honey, bit of vanilla and a pinch of mineral rich sea salt is all we put into this creamy, nutrient dense frozen treat. I filled the popsicle molds and let those fully freeze overnight. When I was ready to remove them from their molds, I melted some good ingredient dark chocolate chips with unrefined coconut oil until it was nice and creamy. I dunked each popsicle into the melted chocolate and then let the chocolate set on a Parchment lined baking sheet. They firmed up almost immediately and quickly. Thereafter. I placed each popsicle into its own bag so that I could store them nicely in the freezer for the kids to have their own snacks. These are gut friendly, low sugar, and they're free of food dyes, artificial flavors, and seed oils. They're perfect for summer!
