let's make a Halloween theme I've seen this on videos but I was honestly so worried that the dye was getting all over my kids hair but it really doesn't work then I actually happen to have a little eyeball I luckily had also gotten these little party papers from Michael's for really cheap in the dollar section I like to use them for spooky bath times but they were also perfect for this purpose look how cute all these spooky little items are this was a super easy and fun family together and they give them long time definitely in the century does now
