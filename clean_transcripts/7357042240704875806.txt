I can't remember anyone I've ever seen at a public pool with such a memorable body good or bad that I think about it ever again I've never been enamored by an attractive person in a bar at an airport enough for them to grab my attention more than just the once I've never thought I wonder if that woman's jeans are a bigger size this year than they were last year never sat at a table at a party and repeated a story about the way someone's arms looked in their tank top or which not someone had on their belt when I saw them last when I talk about my friends sometimes I will bother to note that they are beautiful yes but I will list the things that make them that way that they're funny and thoughtful kind and caring strange and lovely not that their frame is small or their clothes are expensive because it is one thing to want to be looked at and another to want to be known I cannot wait for you to meet her she's in such good shape doesn't roll off the tongue layer cannot wait for you to meet her she's so nice and funny you are going to love her some things are here to say and some things are bound to go and I promise you from the deepest part of my soul you will be remembered for the way that you are not the way that you look
