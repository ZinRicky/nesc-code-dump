I'm a single mom of four kids and I post my content to encourage other women to leave their shitty situations. It's not you that's making your marriage miserable. It's probably just your miserable husband. I'm currently in a custody battle of my life. I've already paid like $25,000 of my own money to continue this fight. I have represented myself and won. So, um, I have done everything I can do, uh, my. On my own. And I super duper need help. And so if you just wanna click on the link and look at this product that I just put on my face, I think I did it wrong cause I put a primer on first, but I need a primer. But it is one of those Peter Thomas Roth. Thomas Roths. Or you could just look through my showcase and buy anything else I need to pay thousands and thousands more to keep up this fight. And so I appreciate the help.
