where are my tired girlies at? please I need to know I'm not the only one that looks forward to bedtime all day long but after a busy evening of making dinner cleaning up, breaking up fights coercing children through the shower bribing them to go to bed reading five stories and finally turning the lights out I need time to unwind no matter how tired I am I honestly just won't be able to sleep if I don't take a bit of silent time just for me to relax and if you know me you know I swear by BraveFace I've been using their herbal remedies for a good two years now and personally I find them very effective if you're looking for a bit of inspiration for your own evening routine BraveFace have just released a calm curation range you can pick and choose which items you want in your bundle theres a Mindset Journal the beautiful Amberjack Smoked Lavender candle and body wash as well as the Herb Farm Sleep Well cream and the Calm Mood face mist which you know is one of my OGs as well as the BraveFace trio of course which has genuinely really helped support me through my anxious feelings this would be a lovely calming gift for yourself or maybe pop it under the tree for a loved one
