please give me 30 seconds of your time I want to convince you to please take on an immigration pro Bono case we know that the Trump administration is committed to what they're calling mass deportation and while it's not entirely clear what they even mean by that we know that immigrant communities are facing significant threats we also know that unlike in criminal court in the United States immigrants who are facing deportation do not have a right to counsel so about 70% every year end up appearing before the court pro se. pro se in a new country where you might not even speak the language and you're likely traumatized and wondering if you're about to be sent back to danger separated from your family or all kinds of other traumatizing situations children who need representation and children who have an attorney in immigration proceedings are seven times (!!) more likely to be allowed to remain in the United States you have the opportunity to save someone's life when people are seeking asylum here part of that claim one of the elements is to show that it would be a grave danger to send them home and for a lot of immigrants that is substantiated. A lot don't have an attorney, & aren't able to make their case so they get deported and it is a death sentence You might be thinking but I don't know anything about immigration law I'm a civil litigator and I mostly focus on employment law I'm not even bilingual but I take on asylum cases you can do it reach out to your local organization mine in the Twin Cities I work with the is The advocates for Human Rights they do trainings I can hop on a call with them whenever I need to whenever I have a question and you also need to keep in perspective that this is either the difference of them not having an attorney at all for having you like you can learn as you go it is a privilege to be a practicing attorney in the United States and I am imploring you to utilize that privilege for someone who really needs it and for the greater good we need you right now
