Guys, I have just a few minutes, but I want to show you this incredible dress I wore to dinner last night because it's cheap, it's perfect for summer. And I know I'm dressed like a Polly Pocket today, but I'm a fashion girly. Like, this is a good dress, and it's $22. Like, literally, I bought this dress to go to Rome. It was perfect for the dinner last night, so I wore dress of the summer. This is literally the dress of the summer. I'm gonna link it for y'all.
