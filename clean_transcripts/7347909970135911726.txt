every time I've ordered a roast beef sandwich I've always been disappointed because what I wanted was corned beef but I didn't understand what corned beef was it just sounded weird so I never ate it and then I had my first one yesterday cause it was Saint Patrick's Day and my boyfriend thought it was absurd that I refused to eat it cause he's like I'm fucking very confident you're gonna let I don't know what your problem is eat the fucking sandwich so he bought me a sandwich life changing this shit's delicious so good happy Saint Patty's day forever
