To ensure that people have the right to access abortion. Uncanny and obstructive. If you wanna pray and you're against abortion, do it 150 meters away from and come to the left. I'll even welcome you. You are in. If you guys weren't in cheating access, then I wouldn't have to make a law, would I? I wouldn't have to make a law if you guys weren't in cheating access, right? I heard you. I know you're. Oh, I don't care. You can criticize a portion all you want. That's your right. And it's my right of the Legislature to protect the other targets. And that's what I'm gonna do. You may not like it.
