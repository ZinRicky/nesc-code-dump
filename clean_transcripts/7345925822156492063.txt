I'm five in this picture and this is what I looked like when I started hating my body and thinking that I was too fat and like wanting to lose weight and like just not being comfortable myself this is this is what I look like this is what I look like this is what I look like when the adults around me started telling me that I needed to lose weight this is what I look like like of course yes I was a chubby kid but oh my god looking back at these picture makes me genuinely want I don't want my video to get taken down but it makes me very angry because this little girl should have just been worried about ballet been worried about being a child she shouldn't have been so worried about her but I remember this photo shoot and feeling bad because the way this dress fit me compared to all the other little girl I felt bad about myself and my body like I'm a child I'm a child my heart genuinely breaks for this little girl because she deserved so much better than what she got like she's a kid she's a child I can't imagine now at my grown age being an adult looking at a child like this and commenting on her weight I genuinely do not understand how you can see this little girl and the first thing you think is oh she's fat I need to tell her she's fat and make her lose weight everything that I do now as an adult I do because this little girl didn't have an adult like me in her life she did not have one person in her life at this age I was 5 6 maybe you're allowed to just exist in your body nobody said that and that's why I do not care how much hate I get how many videos are made about me how much shit is like thrown at I will not stop talking about Celebration body positivity because this little girl needed someone like me in her life and now as an adult that is all I wanna do
