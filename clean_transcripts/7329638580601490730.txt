few people have asked how I do my hair this is what it looks like when it's freshly cleaned out of the shower the diffuser really does most of the work because this is how it ends up in the end shampoo and conditioner nothing special or expensive literally grocery store brand next two things I use is just a light curl cream which also acts kind of like um frizz control and a leave in conditioner and then a light mousse that's all I use I use also a microfiber towel scrunch I don't have any of the fancy shit that they talk about for curly girl stuff I just use a a flat brush like this to brush it and then helps like give the curls their own little pattern like you're kinda like straightening them out and then it helps them come back to life in like a healthy little way I apply all the product with my head upside down just a little bit and I start at the bottom to get most of it off my hands and then put the rest of it through my hair encourage the curl also water helps get the product in your hair so even though I just put product I'm gonna spray a little bit of water on top to kinda help it like really get in there and then I'm gonna use mousse and I use a pretty Liberal amount because I don't wanna make sure my hair is fully covered again upside down today put I literally load up my hair with so much product then I'm gonna kinda scrunch out the excess water excess product encourage the curl gentle scrunching gentle gentle next important step I take these little clips cause see I do I'm a millennial but I do like the middle part and that's how my hair normally parts but if I let it dry like that it's literally gonna be like and look like shit so I take these little clips and I put them in my hair where it's naturally clumping and I kinda hold it up so now when it dries it's gonna still dry up put a few in all over the top of my head and even like in the back back cause this hair will split really funny I'll even put some back here so that that spot doesn't get weird now I'm gonna use a regular ass cotton T-shirt to wrap my hair I'm gonna put it down like this neck side towards me and the arms are here flip my hair into it first we gotta do this and then grab this one and then we twist it and twist it and then we cross it and then twist it in the back get that hair back up in there okay then sit like this while I do my makeup makeup is on so now I take this thing off this is a diffuser start like kind of on the outside and then I like very gently put it in there and dry off the rest the diffuser really does most of the work because this is how it ends up in the end nice and curly and bouncy and light and you just keep scrunching it to get the kinda crunch from the product out and your hair just gets like softer and fluffier and curly and bouncy so lighter products for lighter curls
