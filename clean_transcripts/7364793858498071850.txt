It truly amazes me how many people think princess treatment is being showered by gifts You see so many women bragging about everything that their man pays for on social media and they say that's princess treatment real princess treatment is not in the gifts that he gives you not in the things that he buys for you true princess treatment is the way he treats you emotionally Does he emotionally validates you is he kind to you, is he genuine Can you talk to him about any of your concerns freely and openly Is he patient with you Does he never raise his voice at you and he's always gentle That is princess treatment Not all the lavish gifts that he buys for you society has lied to us convincing us that is princess treatment couldn't be furthest from the truth It’s all about the way he holds you emotionally Him allowing you to be in your true feminine energy being able to express yourself freely and openly that's what it's all about that's what any woman wants that's real Princess treatment women do not care about the gifts yes it's nice but what they really care about what they really need and value from their man is to be emotionally validated feel heard and seen Most woman will tell you that they want respect over any gifts We all need to stop looking at the others bragging about getting  “princess treatment” when all they're getting is expensive gifts that's not princess treatment
