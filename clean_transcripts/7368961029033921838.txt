We've been using coterie diapers and wipes for so long now, so I'm so excited they came out with this swimsuit. It's made with safe ingredients. No fragrances, no parabens, and it has a very elastic waistband to where my toddlers don't feel suffocated. Another thing that I like in comparison to other swim diapers is that they don't balloon up when they're in the water, so they love wearing them.
