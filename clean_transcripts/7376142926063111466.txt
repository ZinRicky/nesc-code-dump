Okay, so right now we are at the Berry Barn. We are actually doing a very cool project right now. We are painting the hay barn with our ballerina farm logo. Artist here, she's gonna hand paint the logo up on the barn. So tonight she is going to wait until best, and then she's gonna project the logo onto the barn. আমি দিয়েছি so Aiden is showing her how to use the lift yeah and we'll center it up but as far as the size goes the worst is when you've already painted it she goes up up and away he is hard at work he's got half to be done more than half
