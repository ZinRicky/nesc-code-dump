So I started pmsing today, and I don't know if this is like, a universal experience. I feel like it is, though. Um, I've turned into just a feral cat that lives under a porch that is potentially ready to just murder people. And I need someone to explain this. Honestly. It might be Doctor Jolene Brighton. She's a mutual of mine on here on TikTok, and she's a genius. But, like, I remember making fun of the idea of PMS when I was pre kids, like, early 20s, and now all of a sudden, I have three kids, I'm in my, like, I guess we were. We're calling it late 30s now. I'm 36, turning 37, um, and my PMS comes on like a absolutely psychotic episode. Like Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, I am full of rage and sass and attitude and ready to, like, watch Westeros burn. And I would either like to know if this is like everybody and this is just how things go and I need to go to some sort of commune for a couple days, or do I need to get my hormones checked
