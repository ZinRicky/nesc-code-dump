we have this tiny RV Airbnb at the farm here we have a bit of a problem we have a Starlink that pushes our Wi Fi down to the RV since spring we've had some issues with the signal cause of the trees grew so I'm gonna use this mini handheld chainsaw to cut some trees in my husband deployed and I could not get the chainsaw started so this is the perfect tool for anyone who just can start a chainsaw or just doesn't wanna bother doing that this made light work of cutting down these small pine trees it was lightweight easy to use it comes with two batteries and I did about 50 trees and I was doing the first battery I also messed around with changing up the tank before I started so I knew what I was doing and it was super easy to do now we have a better signal to the RV and I guess they're happy
