I was really craving a fk to give so I decided to make one I started by preparing a cup of misplaced hope before beating it until it was light and fluffy but ultimately empty much like society's promise to give women equal rights then I ground my soul crushing disappointment and added a pinch to stabilise if you don't have any on hand but you need stabilising might I recommend a lobotomy I added two tablespoons of forced compliance which is really just there to mask any bitterness and a dash of obligatory niceties because no matter what you've gotta keep smiling right once it's as airy as I am shape and bake slowly like your simmering resentment next we beat the cream which should come together disappointingly quickly and the final step is to crush some nuts which feels entirely appropriate to assemble layer there on your fluffy foundation of misplaced hope, soul, crushing disappointment forced compliance and obligatory niceties and there you have it my last fk to give and unsurprisingly it wasn't even a good one
