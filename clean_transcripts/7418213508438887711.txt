I got this 24 pack of modeling clay for my kids. It has a bunch of little colors, and I'm gonna be honest, at first, I was a little skeptical. It did sit outside in the Florida sun for, like, almost 24 hours, and it was in a hot car, so I was kind of afraid that with the bubbles, this was going to be messed up. Oh, look, Mommy's already using it to make a banana, which is his favorite fruit. But it is really good quality. It feels kind of foamy, so it's not quite like the hard clay that I have seen, but it's much easier to work with, according to Madison. It's much easier to work with, and they are very excited. There are 24 different colors. Got a bunch of them right here. Blueberry and a blueberry. Look at that. So if your kids are really creative and love to make things out of clay, I highly recommend you get this on the TikTok shop.
