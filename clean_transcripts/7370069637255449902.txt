One thing I've noticed recently is that when you see your man wearing glasses.. ðŸ¤¤ I don't know how to explain it it just does something to my ovaries if you're a man and you're too shy to wear glasses or you think that you don't look good in them I promise you there is a woman out there that is swooning over you when you wear your glasses
