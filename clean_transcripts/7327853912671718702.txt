This mini tabletop concrete fire pit from the TikTok Shop is the cutest little detail to make any at home date just feel a little bit more special. It doesn't require any special fuel or gasoline, and you don't use wood so there's no smoke or weird smells. You just use regular household alcohol that you probably already keep on hand. It is also safe for indoor use, and it does come with a metal tool to snuff out the fire safely. There are plenty of ways to show someone you love them, and you don't need to spend a ton of money to do that. But you can add sweet little special details like this. I hope you enjoy!
