I gave in and decided how my husband wants some painting but guess who's not here that's right my husband and look there's a sticker under there I'm not painting over that anyway I was like you know what it's fine we'll have a little date afternoon painting the bookshelf and then this man up and leaves fair enough he is helping a friend who got flooded and lost Hurricane so that's a valid reason to leave but all I can think about is that my Kindle book is 80% finished bedtime he does this thing and comes back I could be finished that book and we could be doing this together but instead I'm here doing it by myself and I'm having a miserable time so I think that is the sign to stop this finish the book and then reconvene when he gets home what do y'all think
