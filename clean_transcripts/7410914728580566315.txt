True. After while I got engaged. And to say that I'm proud is an understatement. Now, I'm not proud because she got a man to put a ring on it. I'm proud because she's gonna have a good marriage, because she's gonna walk the walk. Because she found a guy who treats her like a human fucking being and a princess. Cause that's important, too. You see, when I talk about my happy marriage on here, it's because I fucking locked into it. It was a gift of cosmic proportions, meeting the man that I married to. I didn't have a big sister bestie like drew to tell me what, like, a healthy man looks like or what green flags were, or better yet, what red flags I should be watching out for. Were. I was being raised by, like, the early 2 ROM coms. I was raised with the, if he's being mean to you, he just likes you. So I am so fucking proud that drew is going to usher into this next generation of women, which she already has as a single woman, as a dating woman, and now soon to be as a married woman, what a healthy relationship with yourself and therefore your partner looks like. She is going to be the big sister to usher in a next generation of women to know what the blueprint is supposed to look like. And she has a platform big enough to do it. I have always Said, my measure of marriage success is not in the years that I married. And the success of a relationship isn't whether or not you get engaged. A ring on a finger means absolutely nothing if there's no symbolism of partnership behind it. A ring is just a ring. A ring, a marriage is not a guarantee of commitment, not a guarantee of happiness, not a guarantee of compatibility and longevity in a relationship. It's what the ring represents, and I think drew got it right. Congratulations to the happy couple.
