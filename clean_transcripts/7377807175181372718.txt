Instead of sitting in bed rotting all day, I suggest going to a park and sitting on a bench and rotting. Because at least A. You have reason to shower and get out of bed and get dressed, and B. You get a little bit of fresh air, nature, and like you can doom scroll on your phone. If you need to do that, do it. But maybe outside. That is the extent of the suggestions I have. I'm still on my phone, but at least I'm in a park.
