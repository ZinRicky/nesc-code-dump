As simple little outfit like this, you think it's easy to find. You're like, oh, I'll just went to Walmart and get one. I can never find them. I get this off the TikTok shop. These cute little simple jumpsuits that you can just run around all day. And this one is cute because it's a shirt and it's pants, and this part folds over, so if there's little poochies, you can hide it. It's linked here if you want one. This one is one of my faves. Time for coffee.
