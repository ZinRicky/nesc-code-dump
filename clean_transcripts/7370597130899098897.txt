I think we all know what's gonna happen in the next four seasons of Bridgerton even though we've been left on this huge cliffhanger Penelope has had a massive glow up Lord Debbling has come to town he is this avid explorer man pretty sure he's headed off to go to Australia because they said that it's gonna take a year to where he's gotta go to next and so yeah he's obsessed maybe he's a botanist or something like that I don't know I might have missed it I wasn't paying that much attention but anyway he is gonna like go away travel the world come back every like three or four years or something like that he's amazing he's great he's hot he's rich he's you know successful he's the catch she manages to attract the catch of the season therefore making her eligible in the eyes of the rest of the time society Mayfair just the way in high school I had a huge glow up and managed to pull the catch of the year level and that redeemed my hmm shake your reputation as an opinionated smart little rebel because I had the approval um of you know a guy that was popular that everyone loved there's no what better way for a woman to achieve validation than through a man it's patriarchy but I digress she secures him and everyone's like wow she must actually be really cool she must actually be a babe we haven't even really noticed that is crazy um and then of course the guy that she actually likes like the guy next door is like oh oh ah I see you and then he decides to go for it and then he does and you know we've all been happy in a carriage whatever flips the old digit in loves the moment of the mid of consent thought that was really great props to that even smut needs consent folks!! and now we've gotta wait another month to figure out what happens except we already know what's gonna happen because she's got a secret Penelope's got a secret Penelope is xoxo Gossip Girl guy next door said when he finds out who xoxo Gossip Girl is he's gonna kill xoxo Gossip Girl but he's marrying xoxo Gossip Girl it's a classic ðŸ¦† marry kill scenario and then he's gonna get really angry and then she's gonna be like oh my God and then it's all gonna come out and then somehow they're gonna end up together anyway boring I would like to propose an alternative ending I would like to propose that the happy ending for her and I really this not off the cards but this is what I wanna happen is that she does marry Lord DEBLING LOL I FORGOT HIS NAME heads off to Australia to colonise us while he's off colonising the shit out of a country that very much has native title and sovereignty which was never seeded Penelope gets to live her best life funded by colonisation because you know what dismantle infiltrate and these women are not in a position to dismantle they have no power they have to they are at the whims of the man so if you're gonna be at the whims of a man you might as well be at the whims of a man who is very far away and then she gets left alone for three to four years probably longer to be honest he might even get killed while he's over in Australia and then she'll just inherit his estate get to fill his library with nice books get to do her personal projects get to socialise with her friends get to write her little xoxo Gossip Girl columns get to buy pretty dresses and keep glowing up as she has been get to live her life and I hope that the final scene is her writing sitting on a windowsill doing whatever the hell she wants to do with the rest of her life because I cannot stand if it's another series about how love is the answer because you know what for some women being alone in a room a room of one's own is the answer and I would love to see it what do you think what do you wanna happen
