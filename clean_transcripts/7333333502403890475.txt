Let's get ready for a little Valentine's inspired date night at home. I love very classic, elegant pieces, not only when it comes to clothing, but also when it comes to jewelry. And I'm absolutely obsessed with Brilliant Earth and have been for the past few years. I love how all of their gold is 98% recycled and. And their diamonds are sustainably sourced, which I love. So for tonight I'm layering a few pieces, complete my look, and then I went on to cooking, which is my love language, and having a little date night.
