if my man doesn't like it or agree with it I'm not doing it I know there are Gen z's out there screaming right now but that's my man that's my fiance that's my best friend that my life partner we're each others forever why would I do something that my man doesn't agree with or want me to do I don’t know where things got misunderstood in this generation but your partner is supposed to be above everyone above everything why would you do something that they don't agree with or makes them feel uncomfortable they have your best interest at heart so you know it's coming from a good place when they tell you I don't think you should do that you shouldn't do it do you understand like they have your best interest at heart plain and simple if my man doesn't like it I'm not doing it if he doesn't agree with it I'm not doing it it’s out of basic respect and the relationship I don’t know where things got lost in translation
