My mom introduced me to an organic makeup about a year ago called OG, and I use it every single day. So first what I do is I use their sculpted complexion stick, and I just put that in the areas that need a little attention. I blend that in, and then I use their contour collection set, which is three colors. It has the bronzer, the rose color, and then it also has a. A shimmer highlighter that I put underneath my eyes in a few other places, and I love that. It just gives me a light, dewy look on the skin. It's my favorite.
