in these discussions of the beauty standard it's really important to know that I still adhere to a lot of the beauty standard you know criticizing a system doesn't mean that I can completely opt out now I'm not saying that you can't choose to opt out of participating in the beauty standard but I just know for me I like getting dressed up way too much to completely opt out of all of the things that we have decided adhere to the beauty standard like makeup or dresses things like that I find academic discussions about the systems that we live under extremely interesting but just as I can't singularly opt out of the system of capitalism or our political system we can still have discussions about our criticisms of it and I think those criticisms are valid and also important to push the discussion forward because at the end of the day humans are social creatures and to fully go against the norms is very difficult because you are at risk of isolating yourself from your community or your general population and although some people have no problem with that I definitely do I definitely do changing the systems that we live under in my opinion is more like turning the rudder of a ship and waiting for it to slowly turn over time and absolutely you can is an individual jump off the ship but that doesn't really change the ship's direction it just changes whether or not you're on the ship
