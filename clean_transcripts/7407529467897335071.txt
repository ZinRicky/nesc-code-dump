No, seriously, this. I have lived in this thing since I got it. Today I'm wearing it with like a little dress underneath, but still, it's just the cutest little thing. You know what I really love is you can button these buttons down here and it looks like it's one of the quarter zip UPS, you know, like a quarter pullover, cause of the way the detail is right here. I fucking love it. It is the perfect weight for the current temperature. You don't need a full on jacket, you don't need a full on coat, but like, just a shirt isn't enough or you just want something to throw over. I absolutely love it. My boyfriend is complimenting. He's like, oh, my rich lady friend, my kid, everybody loves it. I have. If you haven't gotten one, get it before they run out. It's linked right here.
