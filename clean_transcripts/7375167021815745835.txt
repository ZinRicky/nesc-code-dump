so now that we're done our first year of homeschooling I wanna talk about things that work for us and things that we're gonna change for next year the biggest change is that we're gonna be doing a co op next year a co op means that you can do in person with other teachers learning with the same group of kids every week our kids will be going two days a week and then the rest of the week will be home doing traditional homeschool with mom and that will come with its own curriculum which means I don't have to search and find the curriculums I wanna use even though I liked that part so I'm a little hesitant to see how this goes one thing I loved was outsourcing we found great lessons and extracurriculars that were working with homeschool students that really made it just such a fun year for my kids my biggest struggle was time management I found our days were actually so busy that by the end of the day I like if I hadn't figured out dinner already we were kind of flying by the seat of our pants so I plan to implement using companies like Hellofresh in the coming year honestly keeping up with social media was really difficult too and I don't know if that's gonna be easier next year because the co op but it may be something I have to re evaluate I have more to tell you so part two
