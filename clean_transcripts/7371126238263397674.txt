why are mothers so triggered by people that don't want kids do you know what Paris Syndrome is it's like Paris is hyped up to you as being the most magical romantic city in the world and then you actually go to Paris and you see the Eiffel Tower and you're like this is kinda mid I think there's a similar syndrome with motherhood where you are told that this is your ultimate destiny as a woman is to give birth to a child and then you do and you're like oh this is it and like there's a combination of other like factors like you know the physical mental and emotional pain that you're in um postpartum depression um the fact that you as the mother are expected to be the primary like rearer of this child because you could have the best husband, co-parent in the world and he probably still is not doing as much as he needs to be doing because of the pervasiveness of patriarchy like no matter how wonderful the husband/father is like there is still some way in which the woman is like having more put on her than is her fair share so I think resentment is a big reason why (childless) women trigger genuinely legitimately trigger mothers but it's also just good old right wing political family values capitalism needs women to keep producing tomorrow's laborers so you're ingrained with this belief that childless women are harlots or whatever because they're not creating more fodder for the machine which is why we're seeing abortion rights being pulled back and why you're seeing more people like that NFL motherfucker tell women that they need to embrace like family values or whatever
