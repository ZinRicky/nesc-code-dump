Okay, here I go. Been getting some, like, around the eye dryness. I don't really know what's going on with allergies. Let me see. Take your hand away. I don't know what's going on here, but I was looking it up, and they said one of the best remedies for this type of hydritis is plain yogurt. Haha. And I said to myself, well, jeez, I've got a batch, like, fresh off the oven, like, so here we go. This is. This is my Greek yogurt batch that I've been Greek I. You can see I've actually had quite a bit of runoff. So that's the difference between normal yogurt and Greek yogurt is you're just training off some of the way. So there it is. And I said, she'll use that some over baking. Um. So here I go. I mean, I don't really. Yeah, this is my first time putting yogurt on my face, but it was pretty good. Yeah, just put it all around the eye. Oh, yeah, I think this was a good idea. It was in the refrigerator, so it's like, super. It's kind of hot outside today, so this feels pretty good. I feel better already.
