get ready with me for the first day of school my kids are starting first and second grade tomorrow and this is our third year homeschooling we homeschool year round so we've taken the last week and a half off to prepare for a new school year I like to do little things to make the first day of school special so this year I got grade level t shirts and we're gonna take first day of school pictures have Dunkin Donuts for breakfast and build Legos we were going to do an afternoon treat and a pool day with the grandparents but Debbie had other plans for us who's Debbie she is the tropical storm that is giving us terrible weather right now so I have to reschedule that back to school pool party for a different day but the bad weather does mean that my husband be home tomorrow so maybe we'll figure something else out but I am gonna send him to the office in the afternoon so we can actually get our school work done because that man is the biggest distraction ever I get really excited to start every school year because it means new curriculum new books finding out what my kids are excited about this year we're doing anatomy and geography and my kids are starting Piano Lesson we're going to add a little bit more Charlotte Mason into our schedule with poetry art appreciation in scripture memorization and of course I'm really big into hands on lessons since my kids are getting older and the material more challenging I'm gonna continue to figure out ways to make it hands on and engaging for them take those lessons off of the page truthfully I'm probably more excited than my kids are about a new school year but I just cannot wait so follow along and see other things that we get into this school year
