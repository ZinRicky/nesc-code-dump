and it was at this moment that I realized I screwed up I ran out of coffee and forgot to order more that is not a good way to start a Friday morning at this point I'm contemplating whether I should just door dash some coffee or use the espresso machine espresso machine went out because truth be told your girl cannot handle caffeine so I just felt like it was a waste of money to Door Dash a decaf coffee although looking back at shed because this was a disaster from the moment it started I never really Learned how to use this thing I just kinda wing it every time but that wasn't the problem the problem was when I thought it was a good idea to add my collagen into this frothy milk it tasted like I don't even know it was so disgusting it smelled beefy I was not here learn from my mistake do not put your collagen in your milk warmer frother thing does not work since I started doing these morning vlogs I have Learned a few things about myself first I have a terrible double chin I don't know why nobody told me this but it is so unflattering number two my comfy bamboo pajamas are hecka see through so note to self wear nude underwear underneath them number three I really do not enjoy doing housework and trying to film and move a tripod all around my house while I do things I don't enjoy is just not for me so you're never gonna see cleaning videos from me along the same lines No. 4 I do not clean my house nearly as much as other people do like are y'all really cleaning your house as much and picking up toys or do you just do it for the wall because my house always looks very lived in you can tell kids live here you can tell we homeschool and I just do not care and number five I really enjoy watching people's vlogs but I do find myself comparing who I am as a person and my home to other people on the internet so here's your reminder that you are a great mom and you are enough no matter what
