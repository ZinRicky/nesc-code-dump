My husband is on a 14 hour flight home right now, so I decided to surprise him by making some cinnamon rolls. He's been asking me to make him some for so long, so I thought now is the perfect time. I added all of my ingredients for my dough to my Kitchen Aid. I made sure to incorporate everything one at a time and slowly as well, just so everything can be needed in properly. Once my dough was smooth, I pulled it off the hook and formed into ball and let that rise for about two hours until it doubled in size. I obviously had to try the dough. It was delicious. Then I punched it down to release all the air and rolled it into what should have been a rectangle. Once that was rolled out, I made my cinnamon and sugar mixture and brushed my dough with a lot of melted butter, sprinkled my sugar on top, rolled all of that up, and then cut it into equal pieces. I put those pieces into my baking trays to rise for another 30 to 45 minutes until they're about double in size. After 45 minutes, I checked on them and they were perfect. So I popped them in the oven, and while they were baking, I made my cream cheese frosting. And the timing couldn't have been more perfect because lucky was walking through the door right as I was pulling these out. They were perfectly soft. And gooey. And he ended up having half of that sheet pan. So I think my surprise was a success.
