so I've spent the last few days rotting in this spot right here and by rotting I mean catching up on admin and blowing my nose while mentally I'm deep in a court of wings and ruins and it turns out if you're sick you're not cleaning and if you're not cleaning no one else will and by my standard this house is fkd like yes it's not bio hazard aside from a few questionable tissues but I can say I'm confident those tissues origins for a change I've dedicated an hour to sorting out my shithole which is not a sentence that should be taken literally and spoiler alert one hour turns to two and then two and a half and halfway through I do have a minor mental breakdown but prior to that the clean started well I was in good spirits I had Chappell Roan blasting on the headphones I lit me a few fk off candles to tell everyone you know to fk off and then I came across my husband's laundry system which I won't lie deeply triggered me and it was right about this time that the man in question walked in with three kids and tie from the park and I don't know about you but I really don't like cleaning with people in the house mainly cause it's about as pointless as playing hide and seek with yourself and family games night is always such a core memory I just love breaking up arguments Bending the rules and packing it up all by myself So for today's clean Iâ€™ve decided to go room by room and technically this is just one big room it's a split level dual lounge in our very mid century home and obviously it's our living area so we spend the majority of the time that we live in here and don't get me wrong I love living but I would like to speak to someone about the sheer amount of admin created just from being alive and on that note I won't be cleaning my kitchen for you today because that room is currently under renovation and it would have been done sooner if I didn't have to spend 90% of my time recleaning the same things over and over but it's fine and honestly I might not have seen this sink in a worse state than this and please someone tell me how they got toothpaste on the wall and if I thought the sink was bad the toilet was so much worse and I'm gonna save you that trauma by just doing transition the depressing thing about this clean is it looks like I'm doing a lot of stuff but I've barely moved the needle and I'm almost embarrassed to show you my bedroom but fk it I've been rotting in this room too so I cleaned literally everything and changed the sheets but didn't have the energy to film so a transition will have to do now this is always my favourite part of any clean mainly because it's so fleeting and this part is just a big old hint to my husband to buy me some flowers for the table once everything was clean it was time for me to get stuck into my book just kidding I've got 3 kids to deal with so I can't read till later
