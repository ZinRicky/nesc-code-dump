What do we do with all the milk from our family dairy cow? With family dairy cows and peak lactation, giving up to six gallons a day, what do we do with it? One of my favourite things to do with all the milk that we get is to make butter. First, I'm gonna strain the milk here and then I'm gonna sit it in the fridge overnight and let the fat rise to the top. That fat is cream. I'm gonna scoop up the cream and I'm gonna blend, blend, blend, and then the fat molecules will pull away from the milk and you'll get butter.
