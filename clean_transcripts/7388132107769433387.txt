hello good morning so I pride myself on my page as somebody who talks about the realities of motherhood and I don't kind of gloss over the negatives of it I have always maintained the impression that this is not for everyone it requires a great deal of sacrifice both physically emotionally and mentally and it kind of puts you in this almost like metaphysical role that is never attainable as far as perfection because Lord knows there's no such thing as a perfect mother but just like with anything the reality of it is both amazing and awful all wrapped into one experience and motherhood has brought me the highest highs of my entire life I have gotten more joy out of being a parent than I ever could have achieved alone for me for me and my life and the funny thing is sometimes on the internet I feel almost contrite sharing those sorts of glimmers those sorts of moments of perfection of joy of of gratefulness of overwhelming peace that I feel at being a mother because we have enough women doing that and doing an inner way to gaslight mothers into thinking that it's all sunshine and rainbows but yesterday was one of those perfect days I made homemade pasta salad and if you know you know it is pasta salad season uh and when it hits it's so good we took that pasta salad to a creek a river close to where we're staying for vacation and my boys skipped stones and we laughed and we collected really cool looking rocks which if you've had young boys you know that there's nothing cooler than a cool looking rock and we created the most amazing family memory and I just wanted to share that with you guys because as much as we can talk about the realities and the hardships of being a mother and how no one's doing that for us no one's curating our day in the same way there is such incredible joy and responsibility in in watching all of your work kind of like work out and and everybody like loves it there is true magic in that and I think we need more moms who talk about the good and the bad who validate everyone's experiences both in the joy that we feel in motherhood and also like the little frustrations and the hardships we all go through but yeah that's my soap box I hope you all have such a wonderful memory making summer and honestly if it goes to shit I've had summers like that too you just revel in the good moments when you get them alright good morning cheers
