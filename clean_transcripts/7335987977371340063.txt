I'm not gonna apologize for the person that I'm gonna become when Bridgerton comes out I Penelope and Colin Bridgerton I don't think you understand I don't think you get it I read the entire book immediately after I started season 1 as a plus size person which to be clear I don't think that Nicola is plus size she experiences fatphobia but that woman just has a double chin and is a little curvy she isn't plus size but she experiences fatphobia if that makes sense regardless I don't care she is still amazing representation she's so stunning so gorgeous I love this and I just saw the one minute clip and I've already watched it four times you what I miss you and she was like motherfucker I heard you I heard you the way that she gagged him yeah yeah mmm hmm I'm ready to see this man grovel on his hands and knees for that woman I'm so sorry I just like I cannot be normal about this and I won't and if you think I'm not gonna commit every single episode to memory you're sorely mistaken because me and Polin we're like this we're like that
