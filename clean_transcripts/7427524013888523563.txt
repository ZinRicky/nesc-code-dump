so most of the people that I know who are openly voting Republican in this next election always bring it back to this idea of states rights and I am not even gonna go into the fact that them voting Republican in this election has greatly shifted my opinion on them and our relationship that we'll be able to be having going forward because I got into a conversation recently and they were like no each state should be able to decide like it's not that big of a deal and I said okay well what about me what about me your loved one and my daughter who live in a red state you think that this is okay that if something happened to me or my daughter I shouldn't be able to get the necessary healthcare needed to handle that issue and the answer is you could move you could move that's your problem that's not my problem that's your problem and it just strikes me as so insensitive and empathetic because how can you live in one nation and believe that people in different parts of that nation should have different human rights and then I like to remind those people that the state's right argument is also how they talked about allowing slavery in the southern states and we all decided collectively that that was not okay right that certain people should be human no matter where they live and I just feel we're watching history repeat itself and we we're watching this regressionism happen in politics and it's for a very specific reason but it's been happening since 2016 people are repaccaging and rebranding things like racism like segregation like states rights like anti Semitism as all these different binge words all these different code words all these different gas lady topics that they think are not the same shit that we've been fighting against for 3 400 years and I'm bringing this back to anti Semitism too because it's on the left as well but it's on the left is a completely different thing you know the horseshoe theory where the far left and the far right are not that far off look at who's drawing swastikas on Jewish businesses it's not the right oh wait yes it is it's both and I feel like I'm living in this fishbowl of awareness watching all of these people repeat these age old dog whistles and states right rhetoric and I'm like wait didn't we all learn better didn't we all learn better what are we doing
