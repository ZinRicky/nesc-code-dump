on Wednesday the Supreme Court heard oral arguments about whether or not states can refuse to provide abortions to women whose health is in grave danger that is where we are at right now case involves Idaho's strict total abortion ban which says that patients can only receive abortions if their life is at danger if they are literally about to die but see there's this federal law from the 90s called EMTALA and EMTALA says that if a patient comes to the hospital with an emergent medical condition the hospital needs to stabilize that patient so for example if a pregnant patient comes to the hospital at risk of septic shock uncontrolled hemorrhaging loss of organs loss of future fertility and an abortion is what that patient wants and it would stabilize that patient's condition the hospital must provide it see how the federal law is more broad the state law only kicks in if required to save the woman's life not necessarily her health but the broader federal law trumps state law so what's Idaho to do Idaho's like look when you overturned Roe v Wade and Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health you gave abortion rights back to the states so leave us alone we can deny women healthcare if we want to oral arguments Justice Sotomayor was like okay well under your theory then a state could also pass a law saying that women cannot receive abortions under any conditions even if necessary to save her life the attorney for the Biden administration Elizabeth Preloger was like yes states do get to decide an abortion which states have done but you don't get to criminalize essential healthcare like under EMTALA states have never been able to criminalize or prevent hospitals from providing necessary emergent healthcare Preloger and the courts three Liberal justices point out the horror of accepting Idaho's legal argument women will unnecessarily suffer women will die women will have to utilize unnecessary resources like take a helicopter just to get to a state just to get basic care and as Preloger points out all in the pursuit of nothing doing this when there's really no possible upside in these situations for the fetus and somehow it's not entirely clear how the justices are going to rule we can safely assume that the courts three Liberal justices Sotomayor, Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson will side with the Biden administration and that based on everything we know about them and oral arguments that Thomas Gorsuch and Alito will side with Idaho so that leaves our reproductive fate with Coney Barrett Kavanaugh and Roberts who weren't 100% transparent and oral arguments with how they're going to rule but that is definitely not three people who you want deciding your reproductive fate okay let's pause did this help you understand what the case is about what questions do you have let me know in the comments
