I think this is a really important time for us to revisit the crunchy to all right pipeline and I made this video like a year ago talking about how the super far right and the super crunchy have this like place of meeting you're seeing it with the people who are really really excited about like deregulation about RFK's commitment to like redoing the food system because there is a very specific type of like crunchy Mama loves Jesus doesn't believe in shoes drinks raw milk but votes red type of crunchy parent is a lot of these crunchy views are based in the distrust of the government and they're based in the idea of like health and purity antitox whatever you wanna call it although in small doses those things are healthy and good for you reading labels making sure you have like an 80 20 diet checking the sources of your meats looking into the food industry as something that I did as like a very niche hyperfixation but it can lead you to a place of not trusting medical professionals it can lead you to a place of not trusting the government in general and that can lead you down a place to believing somebody who tells you that everyone's lying I'm the one that you can believe and when you look at purity when you become obsessed with purity you are on a slippery slope to eugenics you can also see this kind of popping up in this like pro birther movement where these people who are like no I'm wealthy and have really good genetics I should have more children all stems from the same place and in a weird dichotomy these like people who seem like super duper hippies are gonna be won over by the right because where the right is interested in the purity of society which already has its own negative implications these super crunchy people who are on this like crunchy Mama mode are worried about like personal health impurity and it's not a far leap like it's not a far jump those are those are little islands on the same on the same wavelength you might start with buying half a cow and getting a doterra essential oils packet but you may end up an anti vax pro fascist government supporter not everyone but it's there
