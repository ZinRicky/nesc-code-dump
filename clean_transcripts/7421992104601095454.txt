Don't do like me. And remember, when you're ordering those, like, slimming bodysuits, they are so stretchy. You have to size down. I always get my normal size, and then it's, like, so big and baggy on me, because they're really. Think you can feel its two layers of thickness. It's like that buttery, soft material, and it will squeeze you in really good. So if you get your normal size, it's like it's gonna be super baggy. So I can still wear it, but size down for sure.
