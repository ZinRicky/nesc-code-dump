stitch this and please explain to me what you mean by marriage is hard I've touched on this topic so many times that I have a playlist about marriage in my profile I've been with my husband for 12 years married for 10 and my marriage is not hard life is hard we've gone through UPS and downs with finances we've gone through having three babies together we've gone through me having postpartum anxiety and mental health issues we've gone through injuries we've moved and renovated houses but not once during all of those hard moments did I ever think gosh being married is hard in all honesty if I hadn't been married all of those things would have been about a million times harder the caveat I think though is that people get married for all sorts of reasons and I have found that the relationship that I have with my husband is the exception not the rule for one reason or another people marry people that they have a really hard time cohabitating with and coexisting with for long term and maybe their relationship was a struggle from the beginning or maybe I don't know people change and grow and they don't grow together they grow apart and that is totally possible but the most beautiful thing in my life is my marriage we have grown together through each stage of being together and I hope we have nice long lives that we continue to grow and change and support each other because we are each other's best friends and biggest supporters and there's nothing better in this life than going through it with somebody who you know is always going to be your person so no I can't relate to marriage being hard either
