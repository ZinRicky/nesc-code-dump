I just got done making the kids a snack plate for lunch. And if you are a fellow gluten free family, I wanna put you onto something. We love just easy gluten free meals. And this pizza from Costco, the sabotage or however you say it, is the best gluten free pizza that we have ever tried. And it's pretty reasonable at Costco.
