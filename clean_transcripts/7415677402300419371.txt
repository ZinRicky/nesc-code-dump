This is everyone's reminder to check their voter registration today. It is National Voter Registration Day. You wanna make sure you know where you're supposed to vote. You wanna make sure that your voter registration is up to date and valid, or that you have registered to vote if you haven't already done so. So make sure you have that done. You can vote early and you can get it done ahead of time.
