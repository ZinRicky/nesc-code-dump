I think the reason that I was put on this earth was drink little fruity tea sit in a park and watch the ducks and I blame capitalism for the reason why I can't do this all time just kidding I forgot the problem is as always old weird men not even five minutes after I filmed that some random old guy came and sat next to me he came to sit down next to me and he was looking at me and like I'm not delusional I know exactly what I look like I just don't want to get a tan line  obviously I'm on guard and I keep catching him look at me and like you know maybe it's just cause we're the only two people there I don't know but also there was so much space in the park he sat down like four feet from me and then he got a phone call and put his phone up to his ear pointed directly at me and like maybe I'm just being paranoid but I really don't think that I was but like regardless I just felt unsafe and like that sucked and it sucks that as women we have to possibly be on guard and can't just like sit in a parking door so it's fine I'm fine hanging out with the ducks
