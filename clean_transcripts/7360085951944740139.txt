and while iâ€™m talking about products I don't like this this Rem Beauty Gloss I dislike it so much wait I got these two the Tower 28 and the Ren Beauty lip glosses on the same day let this let this sink a little bit I it just I've used this maybe three times and the thing is it just never enough product it like it looks like a lot right it's just not like I don't know and my my lips just feel dry and I feel like I can never get enough product mmm and it feels really thick and like hard to like put my I do you mean like okay and like yeah it's glossy well to be fair I had this underneath but like it's just so mediocre feeling it's so mediocre feel and I hate oh my god I hate the applicator why is it shaped like that I'm sorry being a hater I know I'm being a hater I just really don't like this I really don't like this however this mind you I got this like it was like this month it was like a few weeks ago can you see how much I already used I've I've been using this every day I've I've had this for at most two weeks I don't know what to do honestly probably just return this and get another one but like this I'm hater I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't like it I don't like it no but I'm looking at you still don't like how you feel but you look good now I'm conflicted is it the gloss that's good or is it just my beautiful supple lips I I'm gonna have to update you
