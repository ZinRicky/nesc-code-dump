this one simple thing will save your partner so much heartache and make them respect and love you more If your partner comes to you and says “X” is bothering them, whatever it may be maybe you're not texting them, you're not communicating with them, you're not doing something and it upset them and they're trying to communicate that to you what you should do is never disagree or get mad or gaslight them instead what you should do is simply say.. “I understand why you feel that way and I'm sorry” it's really that simple you should never, ever argue with someone who tells you that you hurt their feelings. when you argue with your partner the only thing you'll get out of that is distance and strain in the relationship you need to come at it at an understanding respectful way and this will mean so much more to them People are so used to being gaslit these days and made to feel like they're asking for too much it's not too much for your partner to tell you what problems that they have there will always be someone who is willing to go above and beyond for your partner you don't have to win every argument or even be in an argument with your partner Instead you should just come to understand your partner and their needs
