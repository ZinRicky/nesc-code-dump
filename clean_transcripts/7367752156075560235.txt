so I'm involved here in my life in New York City um not for any particular reason I'm just like and I a night owl um and because of that I interact with a lot of people that I just typically wouldn't I'm a regular it's popular club here in New York and because of that um I just like chit and chat a lot um with just like you know people and this week I was talking to these models very thin very beautiful very privileged models right um and we're having a conversation at the end of the night and they're like talking about McDonald's right and they're like oh I want you know ice cream and chicken and I was like do I make it a thing yeah I'm gonna make a thing and I was like well uh we're actually boycotting McDonald's cause it's on BDS list and they looked at me dead in the eye like genuinely and I fully believe they asked me what's the BDS list like it it I like sometimes I forget that like the world that we live in is so different than like a lot of other people's worlds um so I just explained I was like hey like this is what it is like whatever and they're like oh I didn't know I think you're letting us know I was like yeah try Wendy's Popeyes you know we want if you want chicken get Popeyes if you want a frosty go to Wendy's but just don't shop at McDonald's thank you like blah blah blah and the thing is like I've always done this like I when I go to the you know my my little my little nightlife places like I go and I talk about Fat Liberation stuff right all the time um but now I'm talking about Palestine when I go out um and it's like you know it's a social faux pas right um not to talk about politics when you're going out to to have fun night but the thing is like interacting with like your friends or people that you you know see like socially um I think that's the best way to like kind of move the needle um because you know at the end of the day I I talk about the issues that I talk about on on you know my social media I talk about on Twitter all the time like you know but I'm I'm reaching people in my bubble I'm reaching people that kind of already understand at least the basis of what I'm talking about and have like a base level understanding or agreement on the topic but there are plenty of people that I'm interacting with in my daily life that like genuinely do not see the things that we see online in the same way that we see it um and so using your voice doesn't just mean talking about it online like I promise you there are people in your life that are woefully uninformed and if you have education even even a little bit or if you have resources that you can share like that will be beneficial um I don't know and no one don't kick me out of the room no one is like hey you're ruining the five be like oh thank you for educating me for letting me know and sometimes it's as simple as that
