okay but no have you actually tried dating because I sometimes don't understand why these men think that it's so they could invite you back to their place you go back to their place and you're like sir how have you washed your ass ever there's not a drop of soap in this place I know you're not using that joy dishwashing liquid to wash your hands your ass and your dishes but usually that's the only fucking soap you'll find that orange shit not even the cadon usually they don't have shit up on their walls they think you're gonna be that distracted by the that you're gonna like it's a bit of a shit show out there I'm glad I found a real one a good one so far keep you know what I mean and and actually there's a lot of dudes that don't even have a place and I don't mean they live with their mom cause no shame in like multi generational living that's a thing it's real it's valid and it's it's beautiful and it's you know the way the world is going right now it makes a lot of sense for the multi generational living if it's truly like a multi generally generational living thing where he's contributing and this is a big you know a little home of family of people generally speaking they're homeless and just trying to get with you because they want a place to stay it's real quick easy to spot them they're gonna shower you with love and compliments and fall in love with you really fast and suddenly have some need to just stay your place for a couple days or maybe they help you move and they just like never leave but somehow they're like a little fucking vampire and they watch on and then they don't leave so usually they're homeless if they're not homeless they have a place and it has like a couch one spoon and like that's it then mustard maybe if you're lucky so yeah I was very very very impressed at my boyfriend's house when I went and he's literally so good luck out there ladies good luck
