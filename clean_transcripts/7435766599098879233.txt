have you ever just made a massive fkn mess and then you look around and realise that now you have to fix it? story of my life but also story of this 50 year old pool which I find myself renovating for some unknown reason in case you missed the previous updates we chipped off all of the old tiles and gave her a really good deep clean and now it's time for the new tiles to go up and I will tell you that picking the vibe for this poolâ€™s aesthetic has been one of the most difficult decisions that I've had to make for this entire renovation because there are just so many things to consider and normally when we're renovating I don't mind trying something new with things like paint because if I don't like it I can just change it but with a project like this I am stuck pun intended with the consequences of my decision making so I really have just one chance to get this right and apparently that means some impromptu repairs and we are all too aware that when we get into the body of the pool we are definitely gonna have to do some structural repairs but also just like everything else in our house nothing is straight nothing is level so we had to quickly take a break so Mark could fix up some areas of the spa spoiler alert but that spa has been nothing but a nightmare for us the two interior walls aren't straight they have two different widths and come together at a really weird angle so I'm sure you can imagine what a headache that's been mainly for my husband not so much me I'm just the ideas person anyway it took us quite a few days to get all of the tiles up getting around the main area of the pool was quite straightforward but that spa took just as long if not longer on its own meanwhile we're racing the seasons cause summer's on its way juggling the needs of three kids 4 if you count Goldie which I totally do while playing Russian roulette with the weather now that the tiling's done we still need to grout before the hard work actually begins repairing and painting the pool and picking pool paint is so hard what colour would you choose?? and I'm so sorry but I'm posting in real time and there is still so much to do next up come back and see if I can cope with the coping
