boyfriend thinks I'm punching so need you to clear that one up another episode of why men should not be allowed podcasts bro who looks like a toe actually thinks that his gorgeous stunning girlfriend is punching and tells her that firstly huge red flag and should never think he's better than you should always think that you're hotter than him should always be begging for you and your divine Supreme goddessness unacceptable are you dating a man who thinks he's hotter than you uh it's a red flag because he is telling you you're punching to keep you down to hold you back to project his own insecurities onto you so you think this is the best he's ever gonna get he gets the upper hand you don't leave he gets control podcast bros enabling each other this goes back to the point men protect other men men like this protect other men like this they're all ugly they're ugly cause their personalities are poo their judgement is poor and their intelligence is sub par these podcast bros are wrong and wrong I'm pretty sure that they think they're giving this one to him they've declared he is better looking than his girlfriend which is objectively untrue firstly because beauty is objective secondly because it's untrue I don't care she's just she's just more gorgeous than he will ever be I'm pretty sure that her weight has something to do with their judgement which is disgusting fatphobic gross objectifying she is stunning he is below average secondly why do you have a podcast where you're just like propping up gross men who are making gross judgement about their gorgeous girlfriends I don't know why I said secondly cause I've got a lot of different points to make and I don't know which one I'm up to I'm very annoyed what these men are actually doing here though I wanna get serious is they're protecting patriarchy they're simping for patriarchy they're protecting the patriarch they'll say they're protecting women like not in this context but they will go away and they'll be like these are kinda men that will be like I protect women I love women I love and respect women I have a mother and I've always loved women ever since I had a mother protect the women no cause at the first chance you get here is a woman who is asking for your help and support because she knows the patriarchy she's been defiled by the patriarchy and she wants to seek assurance from the patriarchy to get it which is another conversation speaking that this guy is not only ugly but a red flag and they're deciding to side with him you hate women and you relish the opportunity you relish the opportunity men as the objective gaze men as the objective answer for the objective truth on whether I'm good enough whether I'm beautiful no men pretending that they're looking at this with any ounce of rationality no they are simping for the patriarchy they are approving his message girls if your boyfriend says shit like this don't go to other men for their opinion because if they're not gonna give it to you they are looking for approval from other men and other men only they do not care about your approval and if they get to say that he is punching which that she is punching and he is he is the hotter one then they also get to be the hotter one all the time because they're all ugly and mean and have poo personalities and they need other men to approve of that so that they can keep getting away with dating beautiful gorgeous stunning smart courageous bold loyal friendly funny women they maintain the status quo this way that's how they do it that's how they get off they get to maintain an illusion by setting a standard that's false they present as true and it is false they set a standard they set an expectation men have been doing it for time memorial for each other intergenerationally setting a low standard so that they can all keep getting away with it they exploit us they want us to keep thinking that we're shit they want us to keep thinking that we're not as hot as them they don't want us to find our divine beauty within blah blah blah they want us to keep thinking we owe them something cause if we find our true power we understand it we know it we work it we're no longer as useful to them so this my friends is patriarchy upholding patriarchy in action stay safe
