with all of this discussion going around about Ren Eleanor coming back up even though we've had this conversation a couple times on this app I thought I would weigh in as a mom influencer as a content creator as somebody who talks about motherhood on this app and I wanna take a little bit of a different approach because this conversation is leading us to other places where we're starting to question the type of content that we're consuming and creating cause it's really easy to point at the monster on the hill which would be like the Ren Eleanor account where a child is obviously being exploited and obviously being used as fodder for people with ill intent but it's so much harder to discern from other accounts that feature their children if they're crossing a line or not I've talked about other topics surrounding social media literacy and discernment such as the Tradwife content and how it's really hard for audiences to discern what they're watching and be able to make sense of it because I think we can all agree at this point that that account is dangerous and harmful so what makes posting your children dangerous and harmful there's a couple of reasons one I think is child exploitation this is labour that they are providing this is work this is why they're so fundamentally different than your child being an actor or a model because there are regulations on those industries as far as conditions hours and necessary payment most social media influencers children are neither being compensated or at least not in a regulated way and there's also no telling or documenting or oversee association that is seeing how many hours these kids are in front of the camera that is completely up to the parents discernment and as we know not all parents have their children's best interest at heart this isn't gonna be the same for every single influencer but a lot of the time these children are props um and are not really treated with the respect and dignity that you would hope would be allowed on a professional setting like a set or a model shoot although there's issues in those industries as well kids have no business at all having their own accounts a parent run account should never be like mom plus daughter or the so and so kids there's a reason why you have to be 13 to use TikTok and I don't think they should allow any children to be featured under 13 that's my opinion I get particularly nervous with like a day in the life videos cause I know those do really well and those are like really fun to watch but when they're watching the child you have to remember the back of your head that that means a tripod is set up several times throughout the day for the child there's no reason a stranger should watch your child go through their daily routine I don't think there's anything wrong with having kids in your content especially if you're family and you're close and they like making videos and stuff like that but I think it's really important that we get to a point where we understand that this is a job and an exploitative job and that needs to be regulated for the safety and wellbeing of the child digital privacy digital predators and overall mental health wellbeing needs to be factored in before you post your child online and if you as the parent aren't gonna do it there should be someone something overseeing that
