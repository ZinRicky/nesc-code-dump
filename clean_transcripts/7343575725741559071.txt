Hi, I'm Grace. I'm a homemaker, wife and mother who loves the Lord more than anything. Our home is a small 50s fixer upper on a little half acre. We don't have all that much, but we are rich in other ways. If this year you wanna learn how to run a home, king gardening tips, learn from scratch cooking, learning how to preserve your harvest. And generally be encouraged in the work of the home. I would love for us to be friends.
