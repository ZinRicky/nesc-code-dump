picture this: it's Friday night it's been a long week and I’m in my luteal phase which means doing anything is really fkn hard and I haven't actually planned anything for dinner because after the last 4,500 days or so of being a mum I'm kinda sick of having to figure it out every single day don't get me wrong I love being a mum but Friday night calls for a ‘whatever I can find in the fridge’ kinda dinner I found onion capsicum courgette chicken and a bit of pumpkin that was just about ready to pass away top that with some chickpeas smoked paprika cumin cinnamon tarragon lemon juice and oil salt and pepper and some leftover cherry tomatoes for good measure I went out to the garden to see if there was anything I could pick for tonight's dinner I found that my baby rocket was just about ready to be massacred so I took a few leaves you know to encourage growth my kale has just about gone to seed so I need to include it in just about every meal I make for the next little bit and I found some coriander cause I thought it would go really nicely with the flavours in the chicken came inside and cooked some orzo which is my favourite pasta and I think the best way to do it is to cook it in some stock It comes out so flavoursome and then I lightly sautéed the kale in lemon juice and capers turns out I didn't actually need the rocket tonight but I did cover the tray bake and a whole bunch of coriander and to serve I laid down a bit of the orzo top that with a good helping of that tray bake making sure to get a generous serve of the juices from down the bottom of the pan serve that with a side of the kale it was so quick and so simple to put together but actually turned out really good for a cbf Friday kinda dinner
