I don't want to be referred to as a womb owner. I don't wanna be referred to as a pregnant person. I don't wanna be referred to as a bleeder. I don't wanna be referred to as a birthing person. I don't wanna be referred to as a chest feeder. I don't wanna be referred to as a CIS woman. I am just a woman.
