let me tell you about my mother in law this woman has no chill about her she is always on the go always doing something and is always down for an adventure and I think quite honestly she is my kids and his excuse to have adventures and so today is my son's sixth birthday it also happens to be the grand opening of the Great Wolfage in Naples which is where we live and so instead of just having a normal sleepover tonight like they do on any given day of the week she decides it's best to book a suite at the Great Wolf Lodge to celebrate his sixth birthday yeah so instead of just having a casual movie night at home they're gonna go party and swim at the indoor water park it's fine it's fine and I could be upset because she's taking them to do an experience that I don't get to be a part of but instead I think about the memories that my kids get to make with them and that they get to do something fun and it's going to be a birthday that he's always gonna remember and that is what it matters
