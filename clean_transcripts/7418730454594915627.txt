this is another perfect example of why I only use the term anti choice because pro life is simply not an accurate term to describe this policy position when read as six anti choice justices and Missouri is an anti choice state you can reconcile the clear contradiction widely available research demonstrates that abortion bans actually have disastrous effects on the lives of both mothers and their children so um after the Roe v Wade decision came out we saw a whopping 30 to 40% decrease in the maternal mortality rate of people of color in the postro era researchers are continuing to gather data on the effects of various states abortion bans but researchers are estimating an increase in maternal mortality between 21 and 38% not only do abortion bands increase the maternal mortality rate they also increase the infant mortality rate research is still being developed on the connection between increased infant mortality rates and abortion bands but one logical hypothesis is that when women tell you they do not have the capacity to care for a new child that it may be wise to listen to them also lines up with research um I'm reading from the turnaway study that shows that when a woman is denied a wanted abortion that child over the next four years is more likely to live in poverty to live in a household that is dependent on public assistance and to live with adults who don't who do not have enough money to pay for food housing and transportation and those are literally just two examples if you wanna know more about the disastrous consequences on actual people's lives of abortion bans I can't recommend the turnaway study enough it is a ten year study on the consequences of denying individuals a wanted abortion I'm the feminist lawyer drop any questions you might have in the comments and I'll do my best to be helpful
