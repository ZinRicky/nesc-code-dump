I don't think you understand the mental toll of being dogpiled on by the entire internet I don't think you understand the mental toll of being a fat person on the internet with a large audience I don't think you guys understand what it's like to have hundreds if not thousands of millions of people hating you like I don't think you guys cannot comprehend what that is like right so you can have your opinions on whoever have your opinions of but I need you all to like understand that the human mind is not meant to withstand the amount of hatred that can be pushed onto one single individual person now on the internet like I the human mind is genuinely not meant to consume that much hatred about oneself it just really isn't so my rule of thumb normally is when a situation is happening before I contribute to dog piling onto a person and saying things I've already been said uh I think about first of all is that person in a place to be able to understand what I'm saying to them to be able to take what I'm saying constructively or is this gonna cause more harm than good also like what are what is the context of what is going on like what is the mental state of this person like why what's going on like I just oh like I uh I have been attacked by Ed Twitter by Taylor Swift stans by you know anti fat liberation people on YouTube libs of TikTok stans like I have experienced dog piling in a way that many people have not um and I truly would not wish that experience on my worst enemy I don't think like I there are very few people who I think deserve to be treated in that way I think there are very few actions um that deserve that type of treatment and um I don't know I guess maybe I have too much Grace um as someone who has first hand experienced the toll that it can take on someone um all I'm gonna say is maybe just I don't know be considerate of that
