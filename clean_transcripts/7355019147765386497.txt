I just spent the last five days trying to give this room the biggest glow up this is how it looked before and no I'm not responsible for that okay this is just how it looked when we bought it not to frighten you if you've been following for a while but we moved in 11 months ago I know what the actual fk right and for the last 11 months my first born has been calling this his bedroom and he's about to turn 12 so for his birthday I wanted to surprise him with a brand new bedroom we stripped everything out plastered sanded and primed every surface in the bedroom my husband put up some panelling and then we painted until we could no longer feel our arms then I cleaned the windows and shampooed the carpets and that was day four done I let the carpet dry overnight and then we came back on day five which was the funnest day of all because today we get to make it actually a bedroom my son didn't ask for much but he did ask for a bigger bed and here's me pretending to put up a shelf which I actually had nothing to do with I put a 15 dollar Minecraft poster in a cheap frame and now it looks like art hung some sheers and these windows will also have some roller blinds but they're not ready yet Re-used these guitar holders which we had from our old house and I found this light shade for 13 dollars and I reckon it looks a damn sight better than what it was my son's use these drawers all of his life which my dad painted for me when I was a baby and we installed some second hand lights which we got from my in laws and after an extremely busy five days this is how it turned out I love that the majority of the things in this room were things we already had I painted my 20 year old side table and that lamp in part one and the wall panelling and the paint we had left over from another project and I reused his favourite things and sentimental items for styling The teenage years can be fkn brutal so I wanted to create a calming sanctuary for him that reflects who he is as a person but also one that he can put his own stamp on and that will grow with him through the next chapter and hopefully if he likes it he might even keep it clean
