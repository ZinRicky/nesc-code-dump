so I've got to the blood bending episode in my rewatch of Avatar the Last Airbender and I just find it so interesting the way that the media that we consume creates villains specifically villains with like righteous causes if that makes sense this is old Waterbender basically discovers bloodbending because her oppressors her jailers kept water away from her kept her locked up for decades she said decades and she used as a way to like get out of jail like that's how she developed bloodbending and to me like that act in it of itself I don't think makes someone evil I think that she did exactly what she should have done to get out of that situation and they make her a villain because she starts kidnapping other Fire Nation people and like locking them up and using bloodbending on them which like yes that that action makes her a villain but why do they make her a villain because like she did have righteous anger her entire she like her community was genocide her community was locked up for decades like she was so severely harmed by the Fire Nation obviously like that anger is justified and it's so interesting to me how we're able to later on in the show like empathize with Zuko and he allows Zuko this great redemption arc even though he's Fire Nation but like a character like this woman whose community was victim to these colonizers who murdered her other waterbending sisters and like I don't know I just I don't think that I I I think that I understand her you know what I mean I just I think it's interesting this is not the only show obviously that does this but it's really interesting to me when these villains that we watch are not like you know just like evil bad villain but like they're villains with righteous causes because like I just it's interesting to see what what line is being drawn in the sand and what is acceptable for one group of people but not the others I don't know personally I think bloodbending your colonizers is okay actually also they do this with Jett too I totally forgot Jett also had righteous anger like all these people have a reason to be angry and we all understand that there is a reason to be upset but the second they do anything that isn't passive they become villains and I just I it it's a little frustrating and again this is not just an Avatar the last Airbender thing this is a very common thing within media it's really hard not to draw parallels to the media that I'm consuming and the way that we're treating real life situations
