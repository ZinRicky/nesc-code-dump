An accusation commonly thrown at trap lives online is that because they make money, or a small amount of money in this case online, then therefore they are truly not traditional and they are just cosplaying being traditional. People like Anna here comment these things because they hear other creators on other platforms parrot these talking points that are just not true. Cause most people are taught, especially women are taught that women have always been borrowed from the workforce because feminism has been such a great thing. Women can now work. But women have historically always worked in some form. Now I'm not saying it's always been sunshine and roses for women in history, cause we know that's not true. Women used to be borders, they used to run out properties, be drink workers, selling things at market. And other skilled crafts like sewing. Really earning an income from home or even outside the home is in line with traditional values. The main difference today, however, is that work is no longer centered around the home, which thanks to the Industrial Revolution, has caused a plethora of problems for both men and women. The big part of the traditional movement is re centering our focus on the home, the main priority in our life. And creating productive households that generated income is part of that.
