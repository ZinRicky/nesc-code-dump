Thank you. 아 귀여워 let's go. The chiropractor. I made it was slightly nerve wracking because that's the first time I've driven myself anywhere since I got pregnant. And I never know when the nausea is gonna hit. But I made it. I made it to the chiropractor back. My house cleaner was here, so all my dishes are washed.
