for the sake of our sons and the sake of this country we need to start opening up what we have as our definition of what it means to be a man because our boys are suffering and our country is suffering for it all of our violent epidemics going on in this country domestic violence school violence bullying um all of this can be tied down to the fact that we don't let boys learn or express their emotions in healthy ways and we have defined manhood as such a small narrow box that almost no men can fully fit into that box 100% of the time for 100% of their life because our idea of masculinity is completely devoid of all emotions except for anger anger is the only acceptable emotion for a man to outwardly express in public so what are they doing with all of their rest of their emotions we already know that men don't confide in each other and talk through their feelings the same way that groups of women do and female friendships do we know that a lot of men think that therapy is sissy um self help looks probably not doing that either so what are men doing what are we doing with all of those pent up feelings of sadness of frustration of um disappointment all of those negative feelings where are they going I know they're going into aggression they're going into violence they're being rerouted and that's either coming out on themselves which is why we have so many men who are unaliving themselves and it comes out on others which is why we have so many issues that we do I have two sons and I honestly would never have thought about this topic until I started raising sons in this world and I realised how few activities are offered to boys whereas we have thankfully pushed girls into more traditionally male activities it is so much more acceptable for us as a society right now for girls to participate in what things that were traditionally boy activities it is not the same sort of acceptance for our sons we need to be teaching our sons how to name their emotions how to properly express their emotions in healthy ways and how to have outlets that are not just violent or sports related those are great if your kid is super into martial arts or super into sports that's a great outlet but also let them explore things like music like art like performance because more boys would be into it than you think and I and a lot of our society's problems could be solved if we just open up our definition of masculinity
