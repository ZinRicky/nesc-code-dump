is it legalistic for women of God to not cut their hair this is a question that I get asked a lot alongside the question of is it legalistic for women to only wear skirts and dresses and my answer is simply no if you have a personal conviction to not cut your hair or a personal conviction to only wear skirts and dresses that's amazing but what is legalistic is pushing that belief on other women of God who have studied scripture and prayed things out for themselves I know so many incredible women of God who cut their hair and wear pants and still carry a great anointing of the Holy Spirit and that's because our identity is found in Christ not clothing or material things
