The biggest problem with today's relationships is everybody thinks “you're supposed to meet my needs” when you say “I'm gonna leave if I don't get what I want” “if I don't get my needs met” that's very immature instead you should be in a relationship where you think that THEIR needs are YOUR needs It should fuel you every day from the second you open your eyeballs in the morning to the second you lay your head down you should be thinking “I will do anything in my power to satisfy your needs” that is true passion and that is the key essential component of any relationship
