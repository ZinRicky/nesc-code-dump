I'm back. The last time I've been on TikTok talking about the manosphere and all that good stuff was probably July. My man and my kid come first, so I had to take away some valuable family time. Also, I'm having another baby in, like, less than three months. Yep. I am a full seven months Pregers. And on top of all of that, I started thinking one. I was doing a lot of homesteading stuff, and I wanted to find a way to make more money from home. As y'all know, I have traditional values, and I ain't putting my kid in the daycare. 2 politically and socially, we complain so much about women not staying at home anymore. The Manosphere's only solution is go back to your 20s and find a high value man. So for the rest of us women stuck out here in the real world, where are all the solutions? Where are the problem solvers of this? Now, a lot of y'all are super negative, but there is a plethora of people and influencers actually trying to help shape and change culture. After all, that's how we got to this position to begin with. So I started a community for women wanting to work from home. It's in the most lucrative industry of 2023 and 2024, and I'm killing it. Anyway, that is my late night update. I took some family time, I got pregnant. I started a full business in digital marketing with a Big community of women. And now it's time to branch out to my people on the TikTok. I'll see y'all down the road.
