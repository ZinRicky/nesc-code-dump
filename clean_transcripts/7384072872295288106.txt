Why are people asking for directions Do you not have a phone, GPS, Google Maps I don't understand why is anybody asking for directions not only that if we're going out to dinner and you suggest a restaurant, location a place and you tell me it's North, East south or west Don't do that Don't that's not gonna help me figure out where we're going what state we are in what country we're in just stop, don't do it I got GPS I can figure it out on my own and I guarantee giving me a compass won't help me get there We need to stop normalizing giving directions It just makes no freeking sense in this age where everybody has one of these one of these make it make sense Okay you can ask for directions if you're like a granny or a grampy you're allowed
