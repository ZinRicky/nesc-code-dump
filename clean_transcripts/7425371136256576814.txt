what if we only allow men to get health care for things like motorcycle accidents and drunk driving if it's necessary to save their life What do you even mean necessary to save their life? I feel like you've floated this idea before and every medical organization has said you can't legislate healthcare no two people's bodies are the same okay add in if it will pose significant health risks to the man nobody knows what that means you're just gonna deter doctors from providing care at all because they're gonna be afraid that they're violating the law oh now you're cooking with gas add in that they'll face 10 years in prison if they're found violating this law or anyone who drives them to the hospital or just like helps them in any way oh my god what no this is terrible health care policy and men will die as a result of this no we have an exception for that if it's necessary to save their life oh my god you're no we're not doing this you're not listening feels like we're just gonna have to agree to disagree here how about for now we're just gonna leave it up to the States and then if we see that it has terrible health care consequences we'll just do everything we can to enact it everywhere
