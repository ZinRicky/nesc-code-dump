it's birthday season in my house and it's just occurred to me that my youngest girl has never had a cake and considering she would have watched me baking cakes for everybody else for the last few years and yet never had one for herself that just feels like an absolute tragedy and to be totally honest I'm feeling like the worst mum in the world right now but she's my youngest and also sort of kind of an accident and I don't harbour any resentment but you know what it's like when you get through all of the other kids and you just kinda run out of energy and she's always so good about it she doesn't even complain so I just didn't think that she minded not to mention she's got some interesting dietary requirements to work around which makes cake baking a whole lot more challenging but today we're gonna right some wrongs and put all of her favourite foods in one place I started by boiling a potato and a kumera before getting started on my cake batter I piped on the frosting and topped it with some crispy chicken fat and some peanut butter and then it was time to sing Happy Birthday to the birthday girl this is Goldie she's our very excitable Hungarian vizsla and today she turns 3 and while I was cutting the cake she took off her hat and just opted for the classic birthday suit look and the good thing about this cake Goldie is honestly you don't need to share it personally I didn't think that I had baking a dog cake on my bingo card but it made for one happy girl
