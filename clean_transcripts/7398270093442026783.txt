I am a former teacher and now homeschool mom and these are some things I do at my homeschool that you might wanna do too my kids are in second and first grade and we do a lot of read alouds in our family but I wanted to be more meaningful and include more story elements so I started this reading journal and so what we do is every time we start a new read aloud they will come in here and kind of make like a title picture write down the title the characters that are in there where the story is taking place and then as I'm reading I ask engaging questions about problems they're facing what are some solutions they might have to the problems what do you think is going to happen like prediction making inferences and we'll ask those questions as we're going through and then we will jot them down on in their journal I put each title on a little tab so we could easily see like what books we did with and honestly I was going to put this away because it was first grade and we're starting a new school year but I just made a little second tab so we could go ahead and start second grade journaling right in here and it's going to be a great way to show the progress that she has made from first grade and second grade and kind of add on to the elements we've already studied
