Yâ€™know those short shorts that men are wearing these days you know my man is an objectively handsome man he looks strong and built he gets compliments all the time respectfully okay, anybody would look at him and say that is a good looking guy Itâ€™s a problem because I'm quite literally attracted to him 24/7 that's not in question But he puts on those short shorts on and oh good Lord I see his muscular beautiful legs Built by years of athleticism and Iron Mans strengthened by years of bodybuilding weightlifting squat And Iâ€™m just like.. you little sluht they compliment his bum in the best way Lookin thicker than a snicker But today he pushed it he pushed it a little too far He put on his fitted Young LA T-shirt with those little short shorts and ðŸ˜© The audacity on him I have we have work to do I have a ton of emails to respond to and how in the world am I gonna be able to focus on anything when he's looking this fine god I love those little short shorts Donâ€™t even get me started on working out with him It is darn near impossible he's a menace that's it's it's that simple he's a menace not only to me but to society itself
