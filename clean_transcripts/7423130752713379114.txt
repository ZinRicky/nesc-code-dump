another Hurricane must have my ingredients mushroom coffee I really like this because it is energy without the crash so you don't get jittery or anything like that like caffeine normally does and this is nice because you normally would mix it with hot water but in the event that you lose power can mix it with a lukewarm room temperature bottle of water as well and still get your coffee and gives you plenty of energy for all of the debris cleanups
