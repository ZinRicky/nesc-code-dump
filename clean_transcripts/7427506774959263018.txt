what should you do if you're not in the mood for intimacy but your spouse is okay, I know you're tired I know it's been a long day Maybe you've been doing household chores all day you're cleaning you're not in the mood here's my best tip of advice if you want your marriage to work.. just do it really just do it is your job, your duty as a spouse a partner to fulfill your partner's needs and I'm not saying if you're sick or you're on your deathbed coughing or puking or you just got surgery by god means like you can have your days off but from day to day if you're just tired that's not an excuse
