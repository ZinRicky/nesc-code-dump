have almost made it to the end of our first week of school and honestly we have been way more productive than I thought we would be around schooling really paid off for us this year we finished up our study on the state of Delaware and it has been a fan favorite so I thought I'd share a little bit about how we handle US geography for starters it is one of those subjects that I do a learning journal with because I wanted to be able to use our curriculum plus pull from our own experience experiences in our own travel we're using the our 50 States curriculum by Not Grass my kids decided they wanted to start with the state that we have traveled to so I put all of the names of those states in a jar and we pick from one every time we're ready to study a new state Madison pooled South Carolina as our next state so to prepare I'm gonna make a copy of the state outline from the Not Grass workbook then I'll print out some pictures from our trips to South Carolina then I like to find a coloring page from the state on Google I try to find one that includes like state birds state flowers state Free state animal things like that and then on our next geography day I'll read from the textbook while they colour the picture they glue everything in their journal we watch a homeschool pop video and then we might do one of the activities in the book if we like the next day we work on writing captions for the picture and this is where I work on the writing skills right now we're working on capitalization how to abbreviate and how to write city commerces as the year progresses I'll start to add more writing prompts in for my second grade and then we finish every state by coloring that state on our coloring you have other questions about our geography study that I didn't answer drop them in the comments
